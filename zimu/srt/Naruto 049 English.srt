2
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,706
What?

3
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:37,734
Is that...

4
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,553
an empty shell of sand?

5
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:50,426
Hot-blooded Loser! Finally the
Forbidden Secret Technique Blossoms!

6
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,656
When did he do that? There is no way...

7
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:57,106
It was while you were praying with your eyes closed.

8
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:02,225
The body movement of Lee stopped
for a second because of the pain.

9
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,358
That was when.

10
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:16,685
Gaara...

11
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:33,853
Are those...?!

12
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:36,438
There is no doubt about it. His eyes reveal that...

13
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,176
the demon inside of him...

14
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,585
has been... fully awakened!

15
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,702
Run!

16
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,268
That bobbed-hair is completely exhausted.

17
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:25,773
Gaara is just playing around with him.

18
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,560
Why... Why doesn't Lee-san dodge those attacks?!

19
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:36,736
With Lee-san's speed, dodging those attacks
shouldn't have been a problem, right?

20
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:41,210
It is not that he does not dodge. He cannot dodge them.

21
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,260
What do you mean?

22
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,434
The technique he used, the
Renge (Lotus) is a double-edged sword.

23
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,091
A double-edged sword?

24
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:53,521
Why do you think the Renge (Lotus)
is treated as a Forbidden technique?

25
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,949
uhh...

26
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:59,405
The Renge is neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.

27
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,619
It is a Taijutsu that moves at ultra high-speed.

28
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,370
You couldn't imagine exactly
how much damage it does to the body.

29
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,996
His entire body is in a lot of pain
now. It's impossible for him to move.

30
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,736
Am I wrong... Gui?

31
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,444
No way!

32
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:48,325
He can use no Ninjutsu, and no Genjutsu...

33
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:52,631
Plus, his only skill, taijustu, is useless in his condition...

34
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,786
There is no way he can win this.

35
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,499
If this continues, Lee will probabaly...

36
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,284
Lee!

37
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,631
Alright! Do your best you guys!
...or I will add two hundred laps!

38
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,610
Idiot! There is no way you can be a Ninja.

39
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,936
Yes, I can!

40
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,098
Besides, a person with no Ninjutsu skills cannot be a Ninja.

41
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:26,954
Yes, I can!

42
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:35,253
Anyway... it doesn't make any sense that you are in the ninja academy
with no Ninjutsu and Genjutsu skills, and below average Taijutsu skill.

43
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:38,325
Do you know what people call you around here?

44
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,196
Hot-blooded!

45
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:41,893
Hot-blooded!

46
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,388
Hot-boolded Loser!

47
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,690
Hey, Lee! Calm down! Lee!

48
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:53,372
He is the Hot-blooded Loser that people are talking about.

49
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,201
He resembles somebody, doesn't he?

50
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:59,824
Especially, those eyebrows.

51
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:06,943
Rock Lee, a boy who can do only below average Taijutsu.

52
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:20,761
But you trained Taijutsu like crazy.

53
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:30,006
396! 397! 398! 399! 400! 401! 402! 403!

54
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:34,576
If I cannot kick the log 500 times, then I will do 1000 squats!

55
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:46,203
413! 414! 415! 416! 417! 418! 419! 420!

56
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:48,244
Oh, there is somebody already here...

57
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:55,575
422! 423! 424! 425! 426! ...

58
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,041
I guess I will come back later.

59
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:07,896
Squat 1000 times! If I cannot finish, I
will do Seiken-Tsuki (punch) 2000 times!

60
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:13,653
795! 796! 797! 798!

61
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,528
Is he still here?

62
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:27,825
Seiken-tsuki(Forefist Thrust) 2000 times! If
I cannot finish I will jump rope 2000 times!

63
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:41,830
After training in only Taijutsu fiercely you have finally...

64
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:50,278
Alright. You guys become Genin
from today. I want to hear your goals.

65
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,643
Yes! Tenten!

66
00:07:54,912 --> 00:08:01,090
I want to be a very strong Ninja, like the legendary
Kunoichi (female Ninja), Tsunade-sama.

67
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,216
And, how about you, Neji?

68
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,295
I dont want to answer that.

69
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:10,558
I, I!

70
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,646
I want to prove that a person can be a respectful Ninja,
even if he can use neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu!

71
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,357
That is everything to me!

72
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,648
He has nice eyes.

73
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:31,809
YOU! What is so funny? I am serious! I
will be a great Ninja even only with Taijutsu!

74
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,338
Give up already.

75
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:41,522
He will just die when Gaara's done playing.

76
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:44,772

Geji-Mayu (Thick-Eyebrow)!

77
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:09,663
Not yet! Not yet...

78
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,206
You really do not learn your lesson.

79
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:19,569
There is no way you can beat him. Neji is a genius, unlike you.

80
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,521
Genius? What is a genius anyway?

81
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,722
Even without natural talent I
will surpass a genius with effort!

82
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:32,567
That is my everything. That is my Nindo(way of ninja)!

83
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:34,863
It's useless, Lee.

84
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:43,159
You cannot beat me, even you make great
efforts. It is decided already.

85
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,362
That's not true! It's not ...

86
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:03,095
But you never... never think of giving up.

87
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:35,448
You are wasting your time.

88
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:41,853
It was a bad luck that the bobbed-hair
got a match against Gaara.

89
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:45,983
No. Lee is not a guy who gives up so easily.

90
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,141
What?

91
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:49,423
Because Lee...

92
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,981
Because Lee... you have kept working hard.

93
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:09,413
If I cannot jump rope 1200 times continuously,
I will kick the log 2000 times!

94
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:14,871
1116! 1117! 1118! 111...

95
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,453
Hey, Lee! You taking a break already?

96
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:52,937
Gui-sensei, what brought you here? I already
apologized for my mistake in the last mission.

97
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:02,781
Lee, it is true that you are different from Neji. You cannot use
Ninjutsu or Genjusu. Plus you are not a genius of Taijutsu.

98
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:12,150
But Lee, you are a genius who has
the power... the potential to surpass Neji.

99
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,409
Stop saying such things to try to ease my pain.

100
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:21,209
Its not to sooth your pain... Its because you are...

101
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,082
a genius of efforts!

102
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:34,897
Is it really... true?

103
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:47,443
I lived until now in believing that. I can become stronger
if I train two or three times more than Neji.

104
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:56,965
But recently I started to think
that I cannot compete with a true genius.

105
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:06,306
I want to know if my hard work really is rewarded in the end so
I challenge Neji to find it out. But the result is always the same...

106
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:09,320
I cannot even compete with him at all.

107
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:15,034
Even in our missions my legs still shake.

108
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:21,298
Im begining to think that I can never be
strong no matter how much effort I make...

109
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,104
I am really... really scared.

110
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,109
What should I do?

111
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,252
A guy who cannot believe in himself is wasting his hard work!

112
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,952
Lee, you are very much like me.

113
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,545
Are you talking about the eyebrows?

114
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,811
No, it's not just eyebrows.

115
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,950
To tell you the truth, I was also a loser a long time ago.

116
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:53,830
You were?!

117
00:13:54,215 --> 00:14:01,748
But now I surpassed even the genius elite,
Kakashi, because I worked hard.

118
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:08,592
"I want to prove that a person can be a respectful Ninja,
even if he can use neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu!!"

119
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:17,491
That is your Nindo, isn't it? That is a good
goal. It's a good goal that is worth working hard for.

120
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,875
You just need to believe in yourself and keep going.

121
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,420
Be a strong enough man so that all I need
to do is to is smile when you fight.

122
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,185
You got it, Lee?

123
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,919
Yes!

124
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:55,365
Thank you, Gui-sensei!

125
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:07,607
No! Lee-san! If you fight any longer, you will die!

126
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,393

Geji-Mayu (Thick-eyebrow)!

127
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,488
What?

128
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:20,602
Lee got his speed ..

129
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,057
back!

130
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:27,111
Sensei is watching me with a smile on his face....

131
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,815
That is all I need to be brought back to life strongly.

132
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,711
Be stronger! Be much stronger!

133
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:40,420
Lee-san is smiling, even though he is in serious trouble.

134
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:43,779
No, it is his turn to put the opponent in serious trouble.

135
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:49,168
The Renge (Lotus) of Konoha blossoms twice.

136
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,737
Blossom twice... Lee-san said the same thing before.

137
00:15:56,162 --> 00:16:05,712
The Renge of Konoha blossoms twice. I promise you that
I will be a stronger man at next time I see you.

138
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,700
You're not talking about...?! Gui!

139
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,616
It is what you are thinking.

140
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,946
That means he will open the Eight Celestial Inner Body
Gates (Hachimon-Tonkou) and do a Ura Renge (Reverse Lotus).

141
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:19,910
Ura Renge?

142
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,387
That is right.

143
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,786
Oh my...

144
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:33,306
Gui, how many gates of Hachimon-Tonkou is he able to open now?

145
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:35,810
Five gates.

146
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:40,985
What are you guys talking about?
What is the Hachimon-Tonkou and Ura Renge?

147
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:48,898
Hachimon-Tonkou is to remove
limits as a preparation for Ura Renge.

148
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,029
Removing limits?

149
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,785
That is right.

150
00:16:54,689 --> 00:17:00,451
On the chakra highway from the head to
other parts of the body there is the...

151
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:01,595
Kai-mon (Initial Gate)

152
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:02,363
Kyu-Mon (Heal Gate)

153
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:03,516
Sei-Mon (Life Gate)

154
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:04,516
Sho-Mon (Harm Gate)

155
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:05,516
To-Mon (Limit Gate)

156
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:06,516
Kei-Mon (View Gate)

157
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:07,517
Kyo-Mon (Wonder Gate)

158
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,333
Shi-Mon (Death Gate)

159
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:14,992
These eight spots are where chakra holes are
concentrated. These are called the Eight Gates.

160
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:21,704
The Eight Gates always limit the
amount of chakra flowing throughout the body.

161
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:28,360
To do the Renge he would breakthrough those limits...

162
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:33,135
and gain the power a thousand times stronger than normal.

163
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:39,835
The Omote Renge is a technique
that opens only the first gate, Kai-Mon.

164
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:48,188
it removes the limit his brain has
on how far he can push his muscles.

165
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,689
Then, how about the Ura Renge?

166
00:17:55,175 --> 00:18:00,492
By opening the second gate, Kyu-Mon, he will
increase the bodys energy unnaturally,

167
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:04,121
and then the Ura Renge will start
by opening the third gate, Sei-Mon.

168
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:11,340
No way. The Omote Renge caused a lot of damage to his
body. If he performs a technique above that level...

169
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,651
You are right.

170
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:22,374
One can briefly gain the power that is above the Hokage by opening
all the eight gates. However, anyone who does will definitely...

171
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,494
...die.

172
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:32,836
I'm not trying to find out what the boy means to you, nor
am I going to say that you should put your feelings aside.

173
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:36,927
But there is a limit to
everything. I've lost respect for you, Gui.

174
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:43,362
You don't understand him at all.

175
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:52,335
He has an important goal that he wants
to achieve... even if by risking his own life.

176
00:18:53,981 --> 00:19:03,332
I want to prove that a person can be a respectful Ninja, even if
he can use neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu! That is everything to me!

177
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:10,958
That is why... I wanted make him a
guy who can achieve it. That is all...

178
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:16,155
Lee, I'm going to teach you a new technique.

179
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,243
Hell ya!

180
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,232
This will be your ace in the hole.

181
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,360
Lee! Listen to what I am telling you seriously!

182
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,591
Yes, Sensei!

183
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:36,636
I will tell you this first. This technique
is more forbidden than the Renge.

184
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:40,125
And, this will become the most special technique for you.

185
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,393
Special?

186
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:51,601
Because of that, there is a very
strict rule to use this technique. That is...

187
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,636
That is...

188
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:01,703
What?

189
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:09,000
I do not know what you are going to
do. But this is the end for you.

190
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,474
You are right.

191
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:15,066
No matter what will happen, the next move will be the end.

192
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:20,412
Neji, Sasuke-kun, and ...

193
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,249
I cannot be the only one who loses here!

194
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:33,162
Gui-sensei, please acknowledge that...

195
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,650
...this is the time...

196
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:50,729
to carry out and to protect my own Nindo (the way of Ninja)!

197
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,666
The third gate, Sei-mon OPEN!

198
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:41,563
I came this far by believing that efforts
will be rewarded at the end.

199
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:44,772
Neji,
Sasuke-kun, and Naruto-kun!

200
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:48,216
I cannot be the only one who loses here!

201
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:52,473
This is my secret technique, but I
will specially show this for you.

202
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,291
This is the ultimate special Taijutsu technique!

203
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:00,580
Next Episode: Oh Rock Lee! This is the way a man lives!!

204
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,046
This is the end!
