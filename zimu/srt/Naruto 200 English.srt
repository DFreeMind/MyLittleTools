1
00:00:01,403 --> 00:00:03,701
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:06,536
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:12,638
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:29,097
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:34,534
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:37,231
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:40,742
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,269
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:51,909
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:56,950
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:02,395
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:07,800
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,964
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:19,777
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:47,505
<i>The Powerful Helper</i>

16
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,517
<i>Old Man Genno...</i>

17
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,322
<i>Yes! This is quite good!</i>

18
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,520
<i>Isn't it?!</i>

19
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:10,529
<i>Why'd he do something like this?</i>

20
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:16,098
Now this detonator won't activate.

21
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,938
Excellent, Tenten.

22
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,767
Now we can sigh with relief.

23
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,808
No, it's still too soon to be relieved.

24
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,640
Right... When Genno realizes that

25
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,579
the detonator here has been removed...

26
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,782
he might activate
the Paper Bombs with

27
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,877
some other method and blow up the Leaf.

28
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,717
Oh, right.

29
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:42,996
You jerk. Don't scare me like that, Choji!

30
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,321
Sorry.

31
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,927
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>it seems there's no one here</i>

32
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,529
<i>who's picked up on our movements.</i>

33
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,441
All right, then put things back
the way they were.

34
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:56,609
Got it.

35
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,237
Now then...

36
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,817
You guys do the Kunai Knife practice
like before.

37
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,747
Don't hit the center.

38
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:07,081
We know.

39
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,316
But we were sure lucky...
Nobody hit the center.

40
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:14,826
But I hit it right in the center yesterday.

41
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,928
I bet you were off by a little.

42
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:18,860
What? I don't know about that...

43
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,333
It hit, I tell you.

44
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,502
To think there'd be this many.

45
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:28,438
Lady Tsunade, let's evacuate
the villagens as quickly as possible.

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,901
Hey, you're joking, right?

47
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,440
What do you mean?

48
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,606
If you do that, Genno might...

49
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:38,279
blow up the remaining Paper Bombs

50
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,413
right under the cover
of the evacuation confusion.

51
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,290
I see.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,193
Naruto and the others are removing
the Paper Bombs now.

53
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:49,924
Could you wait for their report?

54
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:04,641
Akamaru?

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,147
Did you find one?

56
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,554
There it is!

57
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:16,613
All right!

58
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,324
Attaboy, Akamaru.

59
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:23,926
How's it coming?

60
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,133
Just a little more.

61
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:29,933
Yes!

62
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,637
I leave the rest to you.

63
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:32,840
Leave it to me.

64
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,849
Did you get it yet, Naruto?

65
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,409
Just a little more.

66
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,948
Just a little more, I tell you.

67
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,149
H-Hang in there, Naruto.

68
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,227
Damn it, you little...

69
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,430
Hey, what're you guys doing?

70
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,933
Oh, umm...

71
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,534
Some money got into the opening.

72
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:05,232
Oh, I'll get it out for you later.

73
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,241
No, no. That'd be dangerous...

74
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:11,137
I mean, there's no time to waste with
eating ramen.

75
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,543
Th That's right.

76
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:15,913
Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn't it?
Well, hang in there.

77
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,776
Yeah, thank you.

78
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:18,615
Thanks.

79
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,812
Phew, we got through it w ell.

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,355
Excellent, Naruto.

81
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,386
We'd like more manpower.

82
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:31,699
It takes too long just with us.

83
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,934
But there aren't any other Shinobi
left in the village.

84
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,904
Well, there are some here, though.

85
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,297
People of leisure who do nothing
but tell about old stories and

86
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,936
complain about
what the young people do.

87
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,203
Huh?

88
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,776
Could they be...?

89
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,714
Did you get that foul mouth from
the Third Hokaget?

90
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,480
It's the job of us advisors to
give advice to the youngsters.

91
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,258
What's wrong with complaining?

92
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:02,820
It seems you have a good nose for
village crises due to your longevity.

93
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:06,663
You're plenty older than
you look yourself.

94
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:10,299
Wh What did you say? You old bag!

95
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:15,209
Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.

96
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:20,677
We've grasped most of the situation.
Where should we head to?

97
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,776
Then there's a place
I've been saving for you.

98
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:26,278
Oh ho. I can't wait.

99
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,350
To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.

100
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,084
That's a powerful supporter.

101
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,390
Wow.

102
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,585
But scary.

103
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:38,228
Hurry! Youth, full power!

104
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,359
The enemy's in the Leaf!

105
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,935
I appreciate it,
but I can't stand those two.

106
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,571
But the removal operation
will proceed swiftly

107
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:54,809
once Guy Senpai and the others who
headed for the Hidden Waterfall get back.

108
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,744
It'll be nice if things were to
go conveniently like that, but...

109
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:00,087
Shikamaru, have you got something?

110
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,151
I mean, it's not ordinary stuff.

111
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:06,182
When and how the hell
did he set them?

112
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:10,860
There are too many Paper Bombs.
An abnormal amount of it.

113
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,099
No doubt about it.

114
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,031
Uh huh.

115
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:16,298
And there's one more thing
bugging me.

116
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,674
<i>We're overlooking something huge...</i>
<i>I really get that feeling.</i>

117
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:26,779
Almost.

118
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:30,075
What're you doing?
You're not supposed to hit the center.

119
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,809
That's right.

120
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm next. I'll miss.

121
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:37,221
In your case,
you'll probably miss even if you aim.

122
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,220
How's it going, Neji?

123
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,889
The Paper Bomb removal operation
is going smoothly.

124
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,693
I don't see anyone
resembling Genno either.

125
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,228
I wonder where the enemy is.

126
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,174
Making us walk all the way to
the outskirts of town.

127
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,847
She must've gotten this slave driver
tendency from the Third Hokage.

128
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:04,008
A place that wouldn't be unusual
for old people to tell old stories.

129
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:07,211
I'll rake her over the coals
when we get back.

130
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:11,322
But what is that Genno fellow thinking?

131
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,993
There's no point to setting
Paper Bombs in a place like this.

132
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,425
Is that what you really think?

133
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,462
What?

134
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,259
There was a plan to build

135
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:22,895
a shopping district
around here before, right?

136
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:26,005
That talk was over thirty years ago.

137
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:32,542
Hmm?!

138
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:48,024
What's this?

139
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,557
H-Hey, isn't that?

140
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:51,960
Yes.

141
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:58,935
Look at this.

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,934
What is it?

143
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:05,476
The Jutsu form written here is different.

144
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:06,746
You're right.

145
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,476
Now that you mention it, there's no doubt.

146
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,112
It looks the same to me, though.

147
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,116
Where are your eyes pointing?

148
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,322
It's the first time I've seen this.

149
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,520
It's nothing new to us.

150
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:21,460
Speaking of Paper Bombs,
that's what they were in the old days.

151
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,123
Then this is an old version?

152
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:27,257
It seems most of the Paper Bombs

153
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,132
that have been set in
the village are of that type.

154
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,830
Everyone, please look closely once more

155
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,306
at the locations where
the Paper Bombs were set.

156
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:37,509
Although this is
a residential area here,

157
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,877
there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.

158
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:42,982
On the other hand,
a large number of Paper Bombs

159
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,076
have been set in places
where hardly anyone lives.

160
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,985
What does that mean?

161
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,180
In the old plans,

162
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,725
that was supposed to become
a bustling shopping district.

163
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,818
What? Could that be...?

164
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,188
If you think about it putting together
various factors

165
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,458
such as the antique Paper Bombs,

166
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,996
the places where they were set
and such...

167
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:06,062
This is a trap that was
set thirty years ago.

168
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,272
Thirty years ago...

169
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:19,050
It's just ridiculous.
Not one person noticed in thirty years.

170
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,619
It's a blind spot.

171
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:22,456
Nobody would ever think

172
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:26,551
that this many Paper Bombs would
be set here in this village.

173
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:29,123
Once buried in a wall,

174
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:32,394
it couldn't be found unless Byakugan
or something was used.

175
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,526
Then you mean
the Genno guy tried to use

176
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,834
the Paper Bombs someone
set thirty years ago?

177
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,237
But how did he find them?

178
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:44,641
Thirty years ago?
Could it be...?!

179
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,747
Shikamaru, where are you going?

180
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,312
Hey! Wait up.

181
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,154
We're finished here, too

182
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,755
Let's go to the next spot, Hinata.

183
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:57,650
Right.

184
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,126
Hinata!

185
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:03,359
What's the matter?

186
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,657
I was using the Byakugan the whole time,

187
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,994
so I'm just a little tired...
I'm fine.

188
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,036
Are you sure?

189
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:10,901
Let me see.

190
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:11,731
Oh.

191
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:14,434
You're kind of feverish.
Your face is red, too.

192
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,541
No, it's not like that.

193
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,737
I'll be okay if I just rest a little...

194
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,208
Really? Then I'll deliver
the Paper Bombs

195
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,217
we've gathered thus far
to Grandma Tsunade,

196
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,616
so you wait here.

197
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:26,679
Okay.

198
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,380
I'll be right back!

199
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,958
Ichiraku Ramen

200
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:43,694
The old man was standing here
the first time I met him.

201
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:55,043
I thought he was just
a ramen loving old man, but...

202
00:11:59,087 --> 00:11:59,678
Hm?

203
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:04,783
<i>Could it be that what</i>
<i>he was looking at then was... ?

204
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,652
Why in a place like this?

205
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,389
Well well...

206
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:39,956
So you found it, huh?

207
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:42,930
Old man?

208
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,029
I guess I cannot let you
go back now, can I?

209
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,704
Thirty years ago, huh?

210
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,707
That's around the time when
my dad was still the master carpenter.

211
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:57,736
It was probably a time

212
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,076
when many outsiders were hired
just like now.

213
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,816
But I wonder if there are records
from back then.

214
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,519
Anything would be fine.
A blueprint or a ledger.

215
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,915
Hey, Shikamaru.
What're you talking about? Explain.

216
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,459
Why did the referral vanish?

217
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:16,856
Referral? You mean the real referral

218
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,923
that became the catalyst for
Genno being suspected?

219
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,230
It was bugging me the whole time.

220
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:26,140
Perhaps the disappearance of
the referral was Genno's doing.

221
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,542
But why was it necessary
to get rid of it?

222
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,875
It all makes sense
if we consider the referral

223
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,573
that disappeared was a fake, too.

224
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:35,646
What do you mean?

225
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:40,286
But that referral was always here.

226
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,856
So it was Genno himself

227
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:47,190
who came here to work with
that referral thirty years ago.

228
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:48,388
Oh!

229
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,998
That is to say... probably.

230
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,197
At that time, he used a referral

231
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:55,168
that couldn't be distinguished
from the real thing.

232
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:58,135
And then he went to the trouble
of making one

233
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,834
that would be recognized as
a fake if compared with that one.

234
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:01,839
Why?

235
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,168
Even with old referrals,

236
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,179
he would be discovered
if reinvestigated again.

237
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:09,815
So he got rid of it right after
you blew the whistle on him.

238
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:14,448
In order to conceal the fact that
he worked here thirty years ago.

239
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,482
It's because at that time in the village,

240
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,221
he set as many Paper Bombs
as were available.

241
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,198
Why?

242
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,495
Why'd you do such a thing?!

243
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,126
Long ag o, there was a village

244
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,603
called Heat Devil Village in
the Land of Mountains.

245
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,839
This is the village where I was born.

246
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:37,639
Heat Devil Villaget?

247
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,244
You don't know it?

248
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:40,241
No...

249
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,977
The only thing recorded in
the Bingo Book you brought

250
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,811
is that Genno's homeland is
the Land of Mountains.

251
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:50,416
To be precise, Heat Devil Village
in the Land of Mountains.

252
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,584
The village itself vanished,

253
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,525
so it probably ended up
not being recorded.

254
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:56,655
Thirty years ago,

255
00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:00,667
the Village Hidden in Leaves
and Heat Devil Village were at war.

256
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:06,633
Neither side didn't give an inch
and the battle was in deadlock.

257
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:09,273
We launched a successful sneak attack
on Heat Devil Village,

258
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,539
taking advantage of the absence
of their main forces.

259
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,909
The tide of the war turned to
the Leaf's advantage in one shot.

260
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:22,717
The only thing written
in the history books

261
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,486
is that an armistice was concluded
three months after that.

262
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:28,552
These three months are what's peculiar.

263
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,261
Heat Devil Village should've been thinking
about a counterattack

264
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,028
before accepting a cease fire.

265
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,597
Here it is.
It's my dad's diary from thirty years ago.

266
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,069
Really?

267
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,239
Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.

268
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:44,005
Here.

269
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:44,974
Thanks.

270
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:48,847
"A middle-aged man from
the Hidden Sand came

271
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,816
"with a master carpentry referral."

272
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:55,379
"His skills aren't great, but I decided
to hire him as I want manpower."

273
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,250
The date is one week after
the Heat Devil Village attack.

274
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:00,819
Then like you thought...

275
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:03,796
Checkmate. This is Genno.

276
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,497
It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf

277
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:12,232
and to set Paper Bombs
throughout the village.

278
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,367
The operation was for the main forces
of Heat Devil Village

279
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,776
to invade the Village Hidden
in the Leaves at the same time

280
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:22,873
as the Paper Bomb explosions
and inflict a devastating blow.

281
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:27,579
I went out to various sites and
set Paper Bombs.

282
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:31,886
The Leaf village did not have substantial
Anbu Black Ops as they do now.

283
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:35,720
So I was able to move about with ease.

284
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,664
Right around the time when
two and a half months had passed,

285
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,829
I finished setting almost all
of the Paper Bombs...

286
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:47,973
and all that was left was to wait
for my comrades to attack.

287
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,136
But my comrades never came.

288
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,042
Why?

289
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:58,207
The leader of Heat Devil Village who
had insisted on "do or die" resistance;

290
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,220
lost his life in an accident.

291
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,949
And the man who assumed
the position of leader in his place

292
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:05,117
agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.

293
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,052
What?

294
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:10,957
"Genno doesn't show up at the scene.
I wonder what the deal is."

295
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,699
He disappeared having left
behind the Paper Bombs.

296
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:18,995
As for me, my intention was to
immediately return to the Hidden Leaf.

297
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,868
I thought the ceasefire would just
be a temporary thing anyway.

298
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:28,179
But Heat Devil Village would never
give me another mission.

299
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,674
Two weeks after the ceasefire,

300
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,447
the Village Hidden in the Vale launched
a sneak attack on Heat Devil Village

301
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,886
and it was destroyed.

302
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:35,919
No way!

303
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,918
They were targeted at a moment

304
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:40,187
when they w ere weariest from
the battle with the Leaf.

305
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:43,558
Their defenses were probably
also down due to the ceasefire.

306
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,589
"Two months has passed since...

307
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,761
Where did Genno disappear off to...?"

308
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:55,401
Then why come back to the Leaf Village
now after all this time?

309
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,835
You set Paper Bombs because
it was your mission, right?

310
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,204
If Heat Devil Village is no more,

311
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,513
then there should be no reason
to go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!

312
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,814
Could it be... someone asked you
to smash the Leaf?

313
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:10,349
Rest easy.

314
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,393
I haven't been commissioned
or commanded by anyone.

315
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,422
Then why?

316
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,124
How can I put this? It felt like a waste.

317
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,867
A waste? What's up with that?

318
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:28,803
I'm getting old and I could be taken
to heaven any time now.

319
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:31,407
If I were to die as is,

320
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:36,314
I'd be buried in darkness without
anyone learning of my traps.

321
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:41,815
If so, then I thought I'd put them
to good use before I die.

322
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,247
Are you serious?

323
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:48,221
You tried to kill people in the village
just for that reason?

324
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,927
I can't believe that!

325
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,969
Then treating me to ramen was to...

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,405
It was to find out

327
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,203
about the present state
of affairs in the Leaf.

328
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:07,743
Damn you! You jerk!

329
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,208
You'll understand when you get older!

330
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,875
I don't understand!
As for me...

331
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:15,616
I won't ever understand it!

332
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:20,990
I'll show you my final big job
as a Trapper!

333
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,992
No way will I let you do that!

334
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,329
My friends are now in the middle
of removing all the Paper Bombs!

335
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,171
I won't let the bombs blow up!

336
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,542
Sounds like quite a struggle.

337
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,043
But who said I was going to
blow up the Paper Bombs?

338
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,410
What're you talking about?
You just said that before you die...

339
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:48,279
I said I would put them to good use.
You're nave, boy.

340
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,517
What?

341
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:54,626
I can put them to sufficiently good use
even without blowing them up.

342
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,491
Katsu!

343
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,425
A Shinobi reads two
or three moves ahead

344
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:05,165
and prepares several moves
in advance.

345
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,428
Remember that!

346
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:13,773
Shikamaru!

347
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,343
What is it?

348
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,614
The Academy students are saying
they're tired.

349
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,516
What should we do?

350
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,154
The Academy students?

351
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,147
The Kunai Knife practice, right?

352
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,224
What? They were still doing that?

353
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,493
You idiot! You were the one
who had them do it.

354
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:32,928
Oh, oh yeah. Then have them
go ahead wrap things up.

355
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:36,598
Rather, it'd be trouble if they were
to get lucky and hit the center.

356
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,196
Oh!

357
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:39,700
What is it?

358
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,808
I get it. So that's it!

359
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,036
It's unnatural for a guy so prepared

360
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:49,514
to casually entrust the
final explosive device to pure luck.

361
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:50,881
What do you mean?

362
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:56,355
A Shinobi of Genno's level should blow
it up with the most effective timing.

363
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,822
In other words,

364
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:02,056
it doesn't matter whether
the Paper Bombs explode or not.

365
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,858
It's just a diversion.

366
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,465
He's really after something else!

367
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,035
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

368
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,539
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

369
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:51,044
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

370
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,174
<i>Suggestively</i>

371
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:58,981
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

372
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:05,591
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

373
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:12,155
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

374
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:17,193
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

375
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:22,368
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

376
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,536
Choji, things might get pretty ugly.

377
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,699
You've figured something out, huh?

378
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,106
We need to contact
the Fifth Hokage.

379
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,643
To not let the returning forces
enter the village.

380
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,304
Got it! But... Why?

381
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,144
If the Paper Bombs were
all a diversion,

382
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,809
then the moment he makes his move

383
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,853
is most likely when
the main forces return!

384
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:07,853
What?!

385
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:10,049
Shikamaru! Choji! We've got trouble!

386
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,022
What happened, Hinata?!

387
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:12,854
Naruto... Naruto's in trouble!

388
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:16,624
Next time: " Multiple Traps!
Countdown to Destruction"
