2
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:33,198
Hey, where's Sasuke's room?

3
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,154
Nobody is allowed to see Sasuke-sama.

4
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,011
Why's that?

5
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,565
Sorry, I can't tell you.

6
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:41,624
Hey, lady. Why?

7
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,301
Naruto, be quiet in the hospital.

8
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:48,130
Hey, hey... I have a favor to ask...

9
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:49,775
You don't need to tell me the end of your sentence.

10
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,411
I guessed that you'd come to me like that...

11
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,688
I appointed a person who can oversee your training.

12
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,491
Whhhhy? I want Kakashi-sensei to train me!!

13
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,432
I have a little business to take care of.

14
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:04,258
So, I don't have time to spend on you.

15
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,204
You're going to train Sasuke, aren't you?!

16
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:13,994
Well... don't say it like that.

17
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,134
I found a more reliable teacher than me for you.

18
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:19,165
Who is it?

19
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,236
It's me!

20
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:27,532
Ahhhhhhhh! You're the closet-pervert!!

21
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:28,939
How dare you.

22
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:34,898
Ebisu Again! I don't allow shameless deeds!

23
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:45,042
Ebisu-sensei is
a closet-pervert?

24
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:48,974
Why? Why is this guy my training teacher?

25
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,232
Besides... this guy is weaker than me!

26
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,230
Why do you say that?

27
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,092
Because! Because! A while back,
with my Harem-no-Jutsu, he was...

28
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:00,388
Henge! (Transform)

29
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:05,464
Ebisu-sama!

30
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,972
Is he going to...?!

31
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,391

Harem-no-Jutsu?

32
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:19,976
No, it's nothing.

33
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:25,763
I'll treat you as much ramen as you want later...

34
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,979
...so don't tell him about that.

35
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,500
You'd better keep your word.

36
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:33,788
Who would've guessed you two knew each other.

37
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,964
Well, it's an unintended relationship, though.

38
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:41,039
Who can forget the humiliation!

39
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:46,747
But why him? I really don't want him.

40
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:49,984
If it wasn't for Kakashi-kun...

41
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,038
I don't even want to teach somebody like you voluntarily!

42
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,167
Then, don't do it.

43
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,981
Oh, you two. Don't say that.

44
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:01,554
Naruto, Ebisu-sensei is a tutor who teaches only Elites.

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,977
He's a special Jounin.

46
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,685
He'll teach you better than I would. Seriously.

47
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,730
Naruto, your basic skills are the worst of the three...

48
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,826
...team 7 members I was in charge of.

49
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,859
This time you'll be taught thoroughly.

50
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,832
What's worse compared to Sakura-chan and Sasuke!?

51
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:33,040
Naruto, it's a fact that your basic skills aren't good.

52
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:36,311
The basics are important for doing everything.

53
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:41,128
If you really want to be stronger, be quiet and do what I say.

54
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,771
Well then, Ebisu-sensei. He's all yours.

55
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:56,849
It seems a bit tough, but you have
the potential to get even stronger.

56
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,615
Do your best.

57
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,875
We're going.

58
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,954
Still... I can't understand it!

59
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,617
Well, it may be true that basics are important.

60
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:19,061
But I can't get stronger by getting trained by somebody weaker!

61
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:22,580
Are you saying that I am weak?

62
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,737
Who else is here!?

63
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:30,065
It's true that I was surprised by such a shameless technique...

64
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:35,487
but judging my ability with only that incident isn't too smart.

65
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,470
You were completely knocked out.

66
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:44,060
Alright. Then, let's try something, won't we?

67
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,601
Naruto-kun, run away.

68
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,424
If you can totally get away from me...

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,367
I will withdraw from this without saying anything.

70
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,017
Withdraw from this?

71
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,681
Yes. And of course, I'll talk to Kakashi-kun...

72
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:05,364
so that you can get trained by him directly.

73
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,304
What? Really?

74
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:10,677
This Elite teacher doesn't lie.

75
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,238
But, this is only if you get away completely.

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,113
That's easy. Later!

77
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:35,137
This is too easy. I'll lose that closet-pervert fast!

78
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:46,846
I lost him already. I'm such an excellent Ninja...

79
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,616
Who's excellent?

80
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:58,124
Don't tell me that you think you can lose me with that skill.

81
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:02,149
What're you talking about.  The chase has...

82
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,748
...just begun!

83
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:22,127
Finally becoming a Movie! Super Romance! Icha
Icha Paradise  Rated R (Kakashi's favorite book)

84
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:27,206
That Elite tutor, even though he's a closet-pervert...

85
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:28,971
...isn't so bad after all.

86
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:32,990
Anyway...

87
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:03,183
See, he's the closet-pervert after all!

88
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,468
What are you doing, Naruto-kun?

89
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:16,343
I see. Your idea wan't bad.

90
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,475
Fine then. How about this?!

91
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,396

Kagebunshin-no-Jutsu! (Shadow Replication)

92
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:31,498
Let's see you try to catch me now!

93
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:35,768
You're doing well.

94
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:42,625
But you're not the only one who
can use Kagebunshin-no-Jutsu.

95
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,497
I won't let you get away!

96
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,213
God...dammit!

97
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,421
Well, next.

98
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,333
Wait!

99
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,771
I see you!

100
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:38,922
Wait!

101
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,149
I won't release you!

102
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:42,769
There!

103
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:43,966
Here!

104
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,636
You've already reached your limit?

105
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:10,649
You're so persistent! Give up already!

106
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,167
Why are you getting pissed off at me?

107
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:16,366
This is a chase, so it's natural that I chase you!

108
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,426
Th..that's true...

109
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:26,757
You now know how great I am. Give
up already and start training...

110
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,813
Heck no!

111
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:35,608
I'll win this game against you, and
I'll get trained by Kakashi-sensei!

112
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,119
Even if I have to beat you up!

113
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,210
I see you still have some spirit left.

114
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:52,506
Coming at me, even though this is a chase.

115
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,631
This is the #1 unpredictable Ninja as Kakashi-kun said.

116
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:57,055
That's Naruto-kun for you.

117
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,625
Take this!

118
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,422

Bunshin-no-Jutsu (Replication)

119
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:19,991
Game Over!

120
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:33,855
Here's your Miso Chasu and Shio Ramen.

121
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,507
After seeing your moves and
analyzing what Kakashi-sensei told me,

122
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:48,792
I can see that you're not good at controlling chakra.

123
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,274
Control?

124
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,729
That's right.

125
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,699
Now, by comparing Sasuke-kun,
Sakura-kun and you...

126
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,286
I'll explain your weakness in order.

127
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,462
As you know, in case of using Ninjutsu and Genjutsu...

128
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:08,574
a ninja channels chakra to start the Jutsu.

129
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,090
I know that already!

130
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:20,644
Ok. then I'll explain how you're the worst of you three.

131
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,517
You say that in a way that irritates me.

132
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,817
Be quiet and listen to me because I'm treating you as promised.

133
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,932
First, if Sakura-kun
uses the Bunshin-no-jutsu,

134
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:43,294
In her case, since she's perfect at
channeling and controlling chakra.

135
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,561
She can replicate herself without wasting any energy.

136
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:54,430
Next, in Sasuke-kun's case... he's
a bit bad at channeling chakra.

137
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:05,051
But his chakra control is perfect.

138
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:09,372
He can create five replications as Sakura did.

139
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,919
However, he uses up a little more chakra than Sakura-kun does.

140
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,460
Oh, so Sasuke isn't that good.

141
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,470
In your case, you don't have time to laugh at somebody else.

142
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:30,001
You are very bad at channeling and controlling chakra.

143
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,986
You can't replicate with the same amount of chakra.

144
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,957
If you still try to replicate yourself, you use up way...

145
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:41,951
more chakra than Sakura-kun
and Sasuke-kun do. Plus...

146
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,450
...you can replicate only two... at most.

147
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:51,963
By the way, if using the same amount of Chakra...

148
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,001
Sakura-kun and Sasuke-kun
will replicate at least ten.

149
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:05,579
All three of you are so much
different even doing the same Jutsu.

150
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:12,201
Well, that was exaggerated to show the difference of you three,

151
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:16,207
but Naruto-kun uses up too much energy due to...

152
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:18,703
channelling too much chakra. Also your Jutsu is unstable.

153
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:22,759
But there were times I was way
better than Sakura-chan or Sasuke...

154
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,119
That's because you happen to have
a way greater amount of stamina!

155
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:35,059
Well, it's true that controlling chakra is harder because...

156
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:39,723
of the power the Kyubi(nine-tails) adds to his stamina.

157
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:47,702
Anyways, you'll get stronger with
the training we'll start from now.

158
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,376
What? Really?

159
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,775
I'll guarantee that. Now, let's go.

160
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,155
Hey, Mister. Your bill!

161
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,744
Oh, yes. that's right.

162
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,097
Thank you very much!

163
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:21,934
We came quite far... but this is
the hot-spring district, isn't it?

164
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:25,824
It doesn't seem like we came here to relax in the hot spring...

165
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:30,133
Hey! Naruto-kun! That's the hot bath for women over there.

166
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:33,663
I will never allow you to do such shamless deeds!

167
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:40,793
I'm not you... It's not like I was trying to peep.

168
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:45,380
Getting that idea is proof of being a closet-pervert.

169
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,875
What is it... your look.

170
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,432
Nothing...

171
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:54,684
Anyway, why did we come here?

172
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,282
Are we training by getting in the hot spring?

173
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:00,837
No. We'll do your training here in the hot spring district.

174
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,155
We'll do it here!

175
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,801
What? It's the hot spring after all!

176
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:14,636
What are you saying?! I told you that it's training! TRAINING!

177
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:17,638
Are we going to train in a place like this?

178
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,207
What are we going to do anyway?

179
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:25,968
Walk on this hot water.

180
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,359
What is it?

181
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:36,400
Walk on the hot water? Can you really do that?

182
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:37,903
Of Course!

183
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,796
I heard from Kakashi-sensei that you've already...

184
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:45,732
done the tree-climbing without using your hands.

185
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,557
The same applies here.

186
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:53,406
What do you mean? I don't remember much about that.

187
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,313
For climbing tree, you channel
the neccessary amount of chakra...

188
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:58,397
concentrate it to the appropriate part of your body...

189
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,213
and just hold the fixed amount of chakra continuously.

190
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:05,368
Because a tree is solid, you just need to adsorb it.

191
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,504
It's training to channel the fixed amount of chakra.

192
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,921
To float on water, you continuously release the appropriate...

193
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:17,594
amount of chakra into water from the bottom of your feet...

194
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:22,422
and you need to balance it with your body to float.

195
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,114
This chakra control is more difficult...

196
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:28,336
than just using an unknown amount of chakra.

197
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,316
This is training you to release a controlled...

198
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:35,120
amount of chakra while using a Jutsu.

199
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:37,765
I don't understand very well.

200
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:41,477
Well, it's better to show it, in your case.

201
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:44,325
First, concentrate chakra to my feet.

202
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:52,149
Then, balance with my body weight
by releasing a certain amount.

203
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,323
It's like this!

204
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,317
I'm going to try it too!

205
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:05,700
First, concentrate chakra to my feet.

206
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:11,192
Then, he said that I need to keep releasing the fixed amount...

207
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:13,921
As I thought...

208
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,650
Hoooooot!

209
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,378
I fogot to mention this, but the water is 60 degrees. (140 F)

210
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:23,744
If you keep failing, you'll be boiled.

211
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,333
I'll master this no matter what!

212
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,320
You're more focused than usual today, grandkid-sama.

213
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:53,952
Finally he's understood my guidance.

214
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,918
It's the time you normally go surprise attack Hokage-sama.

215
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,772
I stopped doing such things...

216
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:05,671
Oh, yes. you finally understand.
Doing what I say is the quickest...

217
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,273
...short-cut to becoming the Hokage.

218
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,464
There's no short-cut.

219
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,215
Naruto, my big bro told me.

220
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,898
If I want to be Hokage, I need to keep that in mind!

221
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,496
I think I'm starting to understand a little bit...

222
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm surprised that he started to grasp...

223
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,417
the trick of chakra control this quickly.

224
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:42,012
I never thought you'd grow this much...

225
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:46,303
That's true that there is no short-cut for anything.

226
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,893
I really misunderstood who you were.

227
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,636
You are a much smarter teacher than I am.

228
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:57,986
You were not just a demon fox...

229
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:02,066
You are a great Ninja of the Konoha!

230
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:06,870
That is...

231
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,597
I don't know who or where you are from but...

232
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:20,753
I won't allow you to do such shameless thing!

233
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,351
That is...!

234
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,815
Keep the noise down! What will you do if people find us?

235
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,500
The closet-pervert lost?

236
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:58,012
Who is that open-pervert?!

237
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:42,128
Hey hey hey hey! What can the open-pervert do for me?!

238
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:46,626
I was trained by the closet-pervert.. and he beat him up!

239
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:52,595
And he was so quick to get away!
Is he prehaps a really great Ninja?

240
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,207
Next Episode Long time! Pervert-Sennin Appears!

241
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,937
I'll find him and let him train me no matter what!
