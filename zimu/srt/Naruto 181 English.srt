1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:03,585
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:06,420
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:12,522
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:28,981
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:34,418
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:37,115
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,626
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:45,153
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,793
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,834
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:07,684
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,848
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:19,662
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:48,756
Byakugan!

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,701
Why did you take down Naruto
with her?!

17
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:26,193
It was an accident...

18
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:29,226
Had I not applied the finishing blow
to her at the moment,

19
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:31,267
we would've been in danger instead.

20
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,167
I know of no instance

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,969
of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
being defeated up until now...

22
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,807
He will be missed.

23
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:44,207
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
your mission is over.

24
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,649
I still haven't taken back the star.

25
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,184
We'll search for it by ourselves.
Thank you for your help.

26
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,499
<i>Hoshikage. The Buried Truth</i>

27
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,179
Rest easy...
I'm not an enemy.

28
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:59,418
Come to think of it...
What happened after I fell off the cliff?

29
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,995
Could it be...?
Did you save me, lady?

30
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:04,052
Yes...

31
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:21,111
I see.
I don't really remember, though...

32
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:24,508
Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.

33
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,150
I'm Naruto, a Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and...

34
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:33,849
Umm, I came to protect the star, but...

35
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,195
You kind of stole it, lady...

36
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,298
I'm Natsuhi...

37
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:49,732
Natsuhi? What?
I've heard that name before...

38
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:51,434
Oh!

39
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,745
<i>That red star's sure pretty.</i>

40
00:04:55,314 --> 00:05:00,013
<i>Natsuhiboshi...</i>
<i>It watches over me all the time.</i>

41
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:04,021
It's the same name
as Natsuhiboshi.

42
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,415
If I remember right,

43
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:07,891
Sumaru said it's a star
that protects him!

44
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,626
Sumaru said that?

45
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,524
Yeah! Say, lady...
Do you know him?

46
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:20,295
Sumaru is my child.

47
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:24,300
What?! So, you're Sumaru's mom?!

48
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:28,446
What?! Sumaru escaped?!

49
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:35,415
I am very sorry.

50
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,451
I was careless thinking
the muscle relaxants were still in effect.

51
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,454
Most likely the guys from
the Hidden Leaf

52
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,895
are the ones who took him away...

53
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,131
What do we do?

54
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,834
It'd be bad news if these circumstances
were to be known

55
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:52,496
by the Leaf, no,
by those in our village.

56
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,369
We've got to look high and low
for Sumaru right away.

57
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,410
There's no need to get rattled...

58
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:03,141
We can take care of them at
our leisure after we find the star.

59
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,577
I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden
in the Leaves something like

60
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,314
they died during the mission...

61
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:11,749
We could also convince Sumaru.

62
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:14,956
I burned Natsuhi's Chakra
into my memory...

63
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:16,456
We'll reach the star

64
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,895
if we follow the remnants
of her Chakra.

65
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:26,997
Naruto was?

66
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:31,240
Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi
who stole the star.

67
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:35,212
But I didn't see them
in the Valley of Death...

68
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,811
Are you saying they escaped from
the valley

69
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:39,111
where the poison gas swirls?

70
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:40,980
Perhaps.

71
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,853
If that's the case,

72
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,686
they might have crossed the border
and escaped safely to the forest...

73
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,284
Hey, let's all look for them!

74
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:52,696
What's the deal, guys?!

75
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,997
Naruto helped all of you,
didn't he?!

76
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:00,772
But if we don't have an order
from Lord Akahoshi... Right?

77
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,168
Yeah...

78
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,443
We don't have time to be waiting
for an order! I'm going!

79
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,174
I'm going...

80
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,487
I'll go too, if it's to look for Naruto.

81
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,279
Mizura, you can't.

82
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,221
I want to be useful in some way.

83
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,988
No... I'll go.

84
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:33,527
Sumaru?!

85
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,334
You're okay!

86
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,139
We safely rescued him from
the Hoshikage's medical room

87
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,041
where he was being held!

88
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:43,477
What? Why was he in
Lord Hoshikage's medical room?

89
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,817
It wasn't a Ninja from
some other village

90
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:50,049
who knocked you all out
and took Sumaru away!

91
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,270
Akahoshi, the leader of your village
was the culprit!

92
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:12,743
In other words, the Shinobi
who made off with the star

93
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,872
and the Shinobi who attacked all
of you were different people.

94
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,951
That's what Neji deduced
word for word.

95
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,120
Why would Lord Akahoshi...?

96
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:26,488
Why would he do that to us?

97
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,449
What does this mean, Sumaru?

98
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:30,156
I don't know, either!

99
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:34,655
But it seems Lord Akahoshi
is hiding something from us...

100
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,566
Isn't it about time you guys realized it?

101
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,801
Akahoshi's using you as he pleases.

102
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,108
Mizura is not the exception.

103
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,043
If you guys continue
training this way,

104
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:52,750
everyone will collapse and then...

105
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,017
No way...

106
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,144
It can't be. That's a lie!

107
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:59,123
Lord Akahoshi is not that
kind of person, ever!

108
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:06,396
Perhaps the Shinobi
who stole the star will tell the truth.

109
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,699
Let's find the Shinobi who disappeared,
whatever the cost!

110
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,705
The forest in the Land of Bears
is deep.

111
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,572
If only outsiders go,
they'd just get lost.

112
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,507
Okay, work with us.

113
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,246
So leave this to me.

114
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:25,445
But...

115
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,118
You rest now.

116
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:31,980
At some point, the time will come
when we'll need your help.

117
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,489
How about it, Akahoshi?

118
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,895
Were you able to get a lead on
the remnants of Natsuhi's Chakra?

119
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,047
This is good.

120
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:36,414
I guess this is what's called
good old home cooking.

121
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:39,290
There's more.

122
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:41,953
One more bowl!

123
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:51,326
But why'd you do something like
steal the star, Sumaru's mom?

124
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:55,231
This is not the first and only time
I took that away.

125
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,438
Ten years ago as well...

126
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:58,600
Huh?

127
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:03,778
Training utilizing that star was painful
for many Shinobi at the time

128
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:05,578
and even caused many deaths.

129
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:12,217
My husband Hotarubi and I
who survived the training...

130
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:23,191
thought to seal the star to prevent
any more victims due to the training.

131
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:40,475
A Tracking Unit immediately caught up
with us after we had stolen the star.

132
00:11:58,637 --> 00:11:59,604
Hold it!

133
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,975
Lord Third Hoshikage...

134
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:15,880
Hotarubi... Natsuhi...
Your thoughts are reasonable...

135
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,949
As it happens, I was also wavering.

136
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,988
But in the position of Hoshikage,
it was difficult to make a decision.

137
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:27,058
I promise to terminate
the star training.

138
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,999
But the hard line faction
of the Star Village

139
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,196
might at some point
resume the training...

140
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,564
You two must leave this village!

141
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,569
I want you to keep an eye on
the village from the outside.

142
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:43,140
And if it seems that the training
will begin once again...

143
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,848
Please stop it with
your power.

144
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,613
Lord Hoshikage...

145
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,992
For Sumaru...

146
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:17,715
Tell Sumaru that... we died.
Please be good to him.

147
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,183
Yes, I understand.

148
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:24,887
Upon allowing us to leave the village,

149
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:28,324
the Lord Third Hoshikage completely
prohibited the star training.

150
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:33,160
Like us, the Third Hoshikage
was also distressed

151
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:36,463
at the damage from
the star training.

152
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:38,867
Neji was also talking about that.

153
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,700
But are the effects from
the star that severe?!

154
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:46,209
Yes. My husband Hotarubi died
due to side effects

155
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,940
a while after leaving the village...

156
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:53,780
I might also die at any time
from the effects.

157
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,052
No way...

158
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,792
Then let's go back to
the village!

159
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:05,224
Tell Akahoshi directly to
stop the training!

160
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,699
Akahoshi is a man who puts
the prosperity of the village

161
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,302
ahead of the lives of
the children.

162
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,964
As proof of that,
he has taken Sumaru hostage

163
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,508
and has demanded that
I return the star.

164
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:21,472
What?! Then the masked Ninja
from that time was...

165
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,347
<i>Hold it!</i>

166
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:27,383
<i>Farewell!</i>

167
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:28,979
<i>Wh What?!</i>

168
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,750
It was Akahoshi?!

169
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,306
What is it, Sumaru's mom?

170
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,809
They've...
Akahoshi has come.

171
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:07,689
Is this the place?

172
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,786
Where's the star being hidden?

173
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:28,136
<i>Hotarubi... Please protect</i>
<i>the star, protect Sumaru...</i>

174
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:46,058
The star is under that rock...

175
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,996
But it seems the entrance
is sealed...

176
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,731
What can we do with
a boulder like this...?

177
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,511
Our only choice is to blow it up
little by little with Letter Bombs.

178
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,312
I won't let you do that!

179
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,120
Wha?!

180
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,850
Didn't this brat die in
the Valley of Death?

181
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:21,230
I won't be done in just like that,
believe it!

182
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,928
You guys step back.

183
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,204
Then I just have to do it again.

184
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:32,673
Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!

185
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:41,245
Here we go!

186
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,850
You're mine!

187
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:29,299
I saw that move coming!
Become a sacrifice for my beast!

188
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:42,743
What?!

189
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,216
Natsuhi... So you were alive too,
after all, huh?

190
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:55,022
Akahoshi, reconsider one more time...

191
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:59,028
If you stop the star training
and release the children,

192
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,925
I'll have no more to do
with the village...

193
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,266
I don't think so!

194
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,438
The Third Hoshikage was stubborn

195
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:11,203
and never wavered
in his opposition.

196
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,404
Opposition to those of us
who trained Star Ninja

197
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,845
and attempted to bring prosperity
to the village...

198
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:25,011
No! As long as I,
the Third Hoshikage, am alive,

199
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,526
the resumption of that training
will never be allowed!

200
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:33,495
Return to your posts... That is all.

201
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:52,410
Have you lost your mind...

202
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,744
Akahoshi?

203
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:59,123
You're the one who's lost his mind!

204
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:02,052
Rest easy and go to
the other world...

205
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,157
Our generation will
raise this village

206
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,690
to rival that of
the Five Great Hidden Villages...

207
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,907
Was this... really okay?

208
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:25,647
It was necessary for the sake
of the village, right?

209
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:31,417
Exactly! We can do star training
as we please.

210
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:39,689
Unforgivable!

211
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:43,058
What do you think of all those
who are training frantically,

212
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:44,193
believing in you guys?!

213
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:47,567
One's even on the verge of dying!
Do you understand that?!

214
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:51,038
Sacrifice is unavoidable for
the sake of village prosperity.

215
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,046
A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.

216
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:58,172
For the sake of village prosperity?

217
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,308
Knock it off!

218
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:02,251
All you're doing is deceiving
the people in the village!

219
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:07,257
This is a Star Village issue...
I will settle this.

220
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:08,620
B-But!

221
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:09,889
Step back!

222
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,561
Yotaka, Shisou!

223
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,351
Wha?! He devoured
his comrades' Chakra!

224
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,992
My Chakra beast has a full stomach.

225
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,360
Things won't go as they did before.

226
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:51,902
Talk is cheap!

227
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:54,469
Sumaru's mom...

228
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,073
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

229
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,745
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

230
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,353
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

231
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:59,233
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

232
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:04,332
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

233
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:11,314
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

234
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:18,221
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

235
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:24,991
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

236
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:31,764
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

237
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:38,441
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

238
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:45,475
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

239
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,490
Neji, how's Sumaru's mom doing?

240
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:54,923
She's stable for now,

241
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:56,392
but her condition can worsen
at any moment.

242
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:57,223
What?

243
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,226
Her Chakra Network that had
already been weakened

244
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,527
due to the side effects of the star
before she received Akahoshi's attack.

245
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,727
In other words,
her Chakra Network is all beat up?

246
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:06,236
Hey, Granny Tsunade
could heal her, right?

247
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,065
I don't know.

248
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:08,633
But either way,

249
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,470
if she were to use
the Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,

250
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,873
there's no guarantee she'll live.

251
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,470
Next time:
"Reunion: The Remaining Time"
