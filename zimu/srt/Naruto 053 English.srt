Special Secret Konoha Taijutsu Technique

00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:02,397
Senen Goroshi (one thousand years of pain)

5
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:07,193
He's completely out. He's so weak after all.

6
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:11,059
What the hell is that big frog?!

7
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:13,079
Who are you anyway's?!

8
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,835
Thank you for asking!

9
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,987
I'm the spirit master of the Toad from Myouboku-mountain!

10
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,154
It's me whom called Gama-Sennin!

11
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:32,859
Hey, stop for a second! Pervert-Sennin Appears!

12
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,336
Sennin?

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,769
That's right!

14
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,498
Hey, hey!

15
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:44,832

Ero-Sennin! (pervert-Sennin)

16
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,798
What're you gonna do for me now?!

17
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,397
He was gonna be my trainer, but you made him like this!

18
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:54,666
'cause he disturbed me from gathering some material.

19
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:55,854
Gathering materials?

20
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,236
I'm a writer.

21
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,377
I write novels...

22
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,771
like this one!

23
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,272
Icha Icha Paradise!

24
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,400
That's....!

25
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,557
Huh? Have you heard of this?

26
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,441
I've became a bit famous...

27
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:21,172
That's an indecent novel!

28
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,417
Besides, that wasn't "gathering material".

29
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,164
You were just peeping in the women's bath!

30
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,306
Noooo!!

31
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,558
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

32
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,089
They heard us peeping!

33
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,346
You're a pervert!

34
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:38,019
Dumbass! I'm not a pervert!

35
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,776
I was getting some inspiration for better novels by peeping.

36
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:45,561
Liar! I don't need to hear anymore excuses.

37
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:48,637
Anyway's... What're you gonna do about my training?!

38
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,320
Your training?

39
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,125
Are you talking about that
walking-on-the-water practice?

40
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,556
Huh... You know it?

41
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:59,444
Well then... take responsiblity and train me!

42
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,501
It's none of my business.

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,948
Hey, hey, hey!

44
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,828
Wait Ero-Senin!

45
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,787
You have to train me!

46
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,786
Shut up!

47
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:15,635
I hate people who don't know how
to talk to others respectfully!

48
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:18,481
Plus... I'm not into guys.

49
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:21,514
well, well...

50
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:25,095
Your book "Icha Icha paradise" was very exciting...

51
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,646
...and cool. It was really interesting!

52
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:32,163
Don't lie! The book isn't sold to people under 18 years old.

53
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,871
Ahh.. that's just what I've heard about the book.

54
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,167
It's useless trying to flatter me like that.

55
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,718
I'm a Sennin.

56
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,123
I'm not that stupid to be convinced by a little kid like you.

57
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,651
Hey! Wait a second!

58
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,904
Later, kid!

59
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:59,526
Amazing! He's a pervert but still so cool!

60
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:10,676
Hey! Ero-Sennin!

61
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,002
Where did he go?

62
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,150
What are you doing to me?! You perverted old man!

63
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,975
I'm sorry, little lady.

64
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:34,020
But those are very nice boing-boing's.

65
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,741
Pervert!

66
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,377
Ouch...

67
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,266
It's so shameful for a grown-up man to be like that.

68
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,622
He might not be as great as I thought...

69
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,231
...but I haven't got anybody else.

70
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,211
Oh well...

71
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:54,733
The women in this village are strong-minded, as usual.

72
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,774
But that's the good part.

73
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,741
As usual? Have you been here before?

74
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:01,586
You!

75
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:04,255
And you have been peeping all the time!

76
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:05,890
You're a Ero-Sennin!

77
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,013
Stop saying Ero (Pervert) with such a loud voice!

78
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:10,919
Be quiet!

79
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:14,580
The hit you knocked out the
closet-pervert with was a pure fluke.

80
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:20,112
Anyway's, you have to take
responsibility for ruining my training!

81
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,382
You're such a noisy kid!

82
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:28,954
Be quiet inside of here for a while!

83
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,379
Hey... let me out!

84
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,502
I want to meet a girl with a nice...

85
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:48,314
...body that makes my heart pitter-patter.

86
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:16,536
This is for what you've done to me!

87
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,827

Kawarimi-no-Jutsu (Body Swapping)

88
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,376
That old man isn't a regular guy as I thought.

89
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,703
That little kid... it's a million years too early...

90
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,667
...for him to come against me!

91
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,886
I doesn't seem that way...

92
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:48,057
I see you have some potential.

93
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,578
That means you're gonna train me, right?

94
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:51,996
Give and Take!

95
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,431
If you do me my favor, then I might do you you a favor...

96
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,253
That is I guess so... maybe thats how it works.

97
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,399
So, which is it?

98
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,828
I need a well-ripened fruit like this...

99
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,164
...and this... and like this.

100
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,573
If you bring me that...

101
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:12,322
...then I'll oversee your training.

102
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:13,679
Really?

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,772
This Toad-Sennin never lies!

104
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,996
Alright! Wait here.

105
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,809
A plan is just a plan...

106
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:33,555
It's not a... for sure thing.

107
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,205
Excuse me!

108
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,073
Ladies!

109
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,195
Mr. you're so funny.

110
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:54,165
Well, this is a real true story.

111
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:56,469
And then?

112
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,036
Ero-Sennin!

113
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,480
He called him Ero-Sennin.

114
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,486
Dumbass!

115
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,907
Who's a Ero-Sennin?!

116
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,230
I brought you what you wanted as promised.

117
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,456
The well-ripened fruit!

118
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:15,262
Stupid!Stupid!Stupid!

119
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,263
That's not it!

120
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,473
It looks so delicious!

121
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,884
Well, don't hesitate and eat them.

122
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,879
No!

123
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,984
Where did those ladies go?

124
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,625
I'm stuffed.

125
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:42,789
The ladies...

126
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,017
I can't be mistaken.

127
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,236
That person is...

128
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,352
Oh well...

129
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,040
I wasted my time so unproductively.

130
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,990
Hey, where're you going?

131
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,896
What about my training?! MY TRAINING!

132
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:01,863
Who cares!

133
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,493
My hard work's all wasted because of you!

134
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,433
What hard work?!

135
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:11,960
I don't have time to waste here either.

136
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,511
I will train myself a lot and...

137
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:14,967
I will be stronger than everybody and...

138
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,623
I will pass the Chunin exam and finally...

139
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,718
I will surpass the Hokage!

140
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,586
That's none of my concern.

141
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,742
You always get in my way!

142
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,878
I don't even like you!

143
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,388
For me to write a great novel...

144
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,879
young girls like the ones I had here...

145
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,929
are neccessary and required!

146
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,220
Oh, I see.

147
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,111
So, I need to bring you some young girls?

148
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,147
Alright.

149
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,851
Henge! (Transform)

150
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,681
What the...?

151
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,986
I feel embarassed if you stare at me like that.

152
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:29,421
What a beautiful girl!

153
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,414
I like you now!

154
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,887
You passed! [Full points!]

155
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,848
What an idiot.

156
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:39,619
You're dead-on my type of girl!

157
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:43,257
What is the name of this Jutsu?

158
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:46,657
I named this
Sexy-no-Jutsu.

159
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,791
Oh, such a wonderful idea!

160
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,997
You're a genius!

161
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:55,801
I think all the adults are so weak to this jutsu.

162
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:59,047
Then, you're gonna train me, right?

163
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,571
Yes... but there's one condition...

164
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,847
A condition?

165
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,335
What is it?

166
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:21,147
Always stay in that form in front of me.

167
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,521
Hey!

168
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:28,591
You're just a pervert after all! Ero-Sennin!

169
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:29,670
No, that's not true!

170
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,322
I'm not just a pervert!

171
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:33,756
What? Don't play innocent!

172
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,440
I am a super pervert!

173
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,312
Shit...

174
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,763
He took a defiant attitude.

175
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,520
Well, everything up to now was just a joke.

176
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,096
I'll train you from now.

177
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,153
Is that the truth?

178
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:56,764
This Sennin doesn't lie.

179
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:02,006
Now kid, continue the training you were doing before.

180
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,594
Alright.

181
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:09,893
Alright...

182
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,560
Shit

183
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,530
Not good at all.

184
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:49,913
Quiet!

185
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,326
Wearing clothes is useless!

186
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,806
Hey! Channel your Chakra again.

187
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,440
Huh? Again?

188
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,869
Shut up. Hurry up and do it again!

189
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:09,468
You...!

190
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:14,038
You look a bit sexy in those shorts.

191
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:18,608
Don't disturb me when I'm concentrating my mind!

192
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,704
Oh, sorry, sorry. Please continue.

193
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,392
He disturbed my rhythm...

194
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,042
I see...

195
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:49,763
this is the seal of Kyubi.

196
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:54,550
It's doubly sealed by two Shishou-Fuin. (Four symbol seal)

197
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,809
That's the Hakke-Fuin style. (Eight Trigram seal)

198
00:14:56,872 --> 00:15:00,637
It's done to make it possible that Kyubi's chakra...

199
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:02,752
which leaks between those two Shishou-Fuin...

200
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,755
return into this kid's chakra.

201
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:06,605
Fourth Hokage...

202
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,847
It's to protect this boy, I see.

203
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,332
But since then...

204
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:16,018
it has been stopped by Gogyo-Fuin. (Five element seal)

205
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,149
By putting an odd-numbered seal...

206
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,397
on top of the even-numbered seals!

207
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:22,155
The chakra of this boy and Kyubi mix together...

208
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,567
out of order and has been unstable.

209
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,992
This is why he can't channel chakra well...

210
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,054
It's ticklish!

211
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:39,224
Oh, sorry, sorry.

212
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:42,469
I guess somebody else did it...

213
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:43,988
The style is rough.

214
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:48,054
I guess it was most likely done by Orochi-maru.

215
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:54,306
Water, Metal, Earth, Fire, Wood (five elements)

216
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,651
Kid, raise your arms.

217
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:58,204
What?

218
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,476
Just do it. Banzai!

219
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:07,437
He sure does make a lot of orders!

220
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,619
Gogyo-Kaiin! (Five Element opening seal)

221
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:35,342
What did you do to me?

222
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,337
Well, I just pressed some body points to make you relax.

223
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:42,491
Just try walking on the water again.

224
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,722
Dammit...

225
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,662
I don't know why but I can do it well now!

226
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,241
I am amazing!

227
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:13,909
I guess it's about time for me to teach...

228
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,577
him how to control Kyubi's chakra.

229
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,318
Alright, kid. Come over here.

230
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,023
Huh?

231
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:21,103
I'll teach you a great technique from now.

232
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,701
What? What?

233
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:23,824
A great technique?

234
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:24,703
Is it a special technique?

235
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,049
Before I teach you the technique...

236
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,174
I have something that I want you to really understand.

237
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:42,616
You may have not noticed yet...

238
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,783
but you have two types of chakra.

239
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,534
Two kinds?

240
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:50,145
Have you ever felt a special chakra before?

241
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:52,152
Special...?

242
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,374
Since you mentioned it...

243
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:02,229
I think I remember that I gained a ton of power...

244
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:07,966
with chakra coming out all of the sudden.

245
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,736
But I don't remember that time very much.

246
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,235
I see.

247
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,129
But, I remember it was different feeling...

248
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,947
than the chakra I normally channel.

249
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,275
If I put colors on them...

250
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,891
usually it is blue, but the other one is something like red.

251
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:29,652
I see.

252
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:44,839
Ok. Today's training is over.

253
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,539
Already?

254
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,241
What happened to that "great" technique?!

255
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,029
I can still train!

256
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,442
Impatience is forbidden for training.

257
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,954
Let's get in the hot spring...

258
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,712
Not FALL into it.

259
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,992
This warms me up.

260
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:20,908
The one drink after training is irreplaceable.

261
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,423
Hey, Ero-sennin.

262
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,594
What is the great technique?

263
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,217
You'll find it out tomorrow.

264
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:28,857
Heh! Stingy!

265
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,032
If he stays longer in the hot water, he'll be a boiled frog.

266
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:13,214
Sorry, Ebisu...

267
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:16,165
that I took your student from you.

268
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,516
No. But I was surprised.

269
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,965
The Hokage-sama has ordered to look...

270
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,929
for you but hasn't been able to find you at all.

271
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,675
Who would've guessed that you're in this village?

272
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:30,942
The Hokage-sama will be happy to hear that.

273
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:34,730
Did you already tell the Third Hokage about me?

274
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,899
No, not yet.

275
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,208
I see. It's better not to.

276
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,430
So, it's about Orochimaru.

277
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,476
No. I'm afraid that's not it.

278
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,492
What?

279
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:51,137
I just stopped by here to get some material for my novels.

280
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:54,759
I'm not the type to put my nose into others problems.

281
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,828
What are you saying?!

282
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,829
I believe you already knew about this!

283
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:06,084
In order to stop Orochimaru, one of the legendary Three
Ninjas, we need the power of another one of the Three Ninjas... you...

284
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:08,836
Jiraiya-sama!

285
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:52,707
First, write my name with my blood on this contract.
Then blood-finger-print-seal of all my fingers on one hand.

286
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:56,641
Then, channel chakra....

287
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,124
In (Hand seal) is Ino, Ee, Tori, Saru,
Hitsuji! (Boar, Dog, Hen, Monkey, Sheep)

288
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,716
Finally, place my hand that made
the contract on where I want to summon!

289
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:06,248
How about this?

290
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,664
Next Episode Transmitted directly from
Pervert-Senin It's the summon no jutsu!!

291
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:13,739
What the hell is this?!
