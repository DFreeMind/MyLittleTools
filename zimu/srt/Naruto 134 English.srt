1
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,510
Conclusion, rain of the tears.

2
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:57,860
When you look at a cartoon, take care to light 
part and try not too to approach you the television set.

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,420
Specia

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,220
What do you want to say by special?

5
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,620
It is impossible that I would be overcome.

6
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,200
Sasuke… You…

7
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,710
As you use this cursed seal, it will take possession of your body.

8
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,950
But if the seal devours you completely,…

9
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,450
You will lose the control of your spirit… For always.

10
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,300
This body…

11
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,420
I do not have time to lose.

12
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,710
I do not feel any more my left hand…

13
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,930
For you also…

14
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,430
To use isn't this capacity is risked?

15
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,960
You knew it?

16
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,050
This place is called… The Valley of the End.

17
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,730
Isn't this the perfect place?

18
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,150
Hein, Naruto.

19
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,240
Ah, it is true…

20
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,680
I had said to you that the time of the discussions was finished.

21
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,520
Then let us stop.

22
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,990
This combat…

23
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,300
Let us stop now!

24
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,160
Following, team 7

25
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,960
Uzumaki Naruto.

26
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,260
Haruno Sakura.

27
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,490
Super!

28
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,180
I am with Naruto?

29
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,500
Lastly, Uchiha Sasuke.

30
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,400
Super!

31
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,530
I am with Sasuke?

32
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,340
I hope that you will not be a ball, dunce.

33
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,830
You!

34
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,040
But, but, but!

35
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,490
Sensei, you said it yourself! It is for that it…

36
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,560
We are a team of 3, not?

37
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,360
It is true! We 3 form only one!

38
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,430
He!

39
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,750
You are not wounded…

40
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,850
Wet hen?

41
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,820
He…

42
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,580
You are not wounded…

43
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,160
Wet hen?

44
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,260
I want to fight with you.

45
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,590
Sasuke!

46
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,520
Me also…

47
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,640
I want to fight with you.

48
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,700
I want never again but 
expensive beings die under my eyes.

49
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,760
[Invocation]

50
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,760
Kuchiyose No Jutsu

51
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,800
Sakura-chan…

52
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,790
I will protect it!

53
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,660
What is there the funny one?

54
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,610
There is nothing funny.

55
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,190
I am content.

56
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,610
To think that I finally will be able to beat you here.

57
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,550
What!? A ball as should not speak to you like that!

58
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,260
At least, I am not a ball which leaves the others behind him.

59
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,190
Let us stop.

60
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,540
Before that, mets your stringcourse. I await you.

61
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,560
I do not need any.

62
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,600
I don't care. Put it!

63
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,750
You will not be able to even pose the little finger on my face.

64
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,150
It is not the question!

65
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,120
You must put it to prove that one fights between Ninjas of of the same Konoha level.

66
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,220
Naruto!

67
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,170
Sasuke!

68
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,120
I will crush you!

69
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,150
You are only one ball!

70
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,210
Arrteeeeez!

71
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,890
And from there…

72
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,410
Chidori

73
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,380
Rasengan

74
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,050
Chidori

75
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,050
Rasengan

76
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,340
Chidori

77
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,340
Rasengan

78
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,450
This will chakra is…

79
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,860
Ca fears!

80
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Naruto…

81
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,880
I am…

82
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,750
It rains!

83
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,200
You lost their trace?

84
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,040
They is good.

85
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,360
They are close.

86
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,680
By here!

87
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,610
I thus arrived too late…

88
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,230
Naruto…

89
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,540
How the things could finish thus?

90
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,560
Ca belongs to Sasuke.

91
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,840
I could not arrive in time…

92
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,870
I am sorry.

93
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,460
Naruto…

94
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,240
You did all that for…

95
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,110
Sasuke…

96
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,910
You are well my son.

97
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,680
When we are together, 
your father does nothing but speak about you.

98
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,230
We are single brothers.

99
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,040
I am the obstacle which you must cross, then
 that we must continue to live together.

100
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,420
Even if you hate me.

101
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,200
You also, you are able to activate Mangekyou Sharingan.

102
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,960
But for that there is a condition…

103
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,520
Your friend nearest…

104
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,560
The Valley of the End… 
Theater of the combat between Naruto and Sasuke…

105
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,010
Isn't this ironic?

106
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,780
If…

107
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:26,320
If you observe the flow of the river… It seems to go without stopping like carrying out a combat.

108
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,230
Just like the destiny of 2 which 
founded the village of Konoha formerly…

109
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,510
Naruto and Sasuke…

110
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,210
Your lives are like theirs…

111
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,360
Your friend nearest…

112
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,620
You must kill it.

113
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,920
I…

114
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,970
Will not let to me handle by you!

115
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,240
I will obtain the capacity with my way.

116
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,520
I will exceed you with my way!

117
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,120
You will see!

118
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,920
The rain stopped…

119
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,190
Because of the rain I do not feel any more his odor…

120
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,740
In any event, to look after Naruto is
 priority before continuing Sasuke.

121
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,470
Yes.

122
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,550
All that becomes interesting…

123
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,990
Afflicted.

124
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,980
I am really afflicted, Sakura-chan.

125
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,680
I had promised to you to bring back Sasuke.

126
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,820
But it is not finished.

127
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,060
I will honor this promise! 
Isn't this what I say all the time?

128
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,940
I never reconsider my word, it is
 as I conceive my way of Ninja.

129
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,920
Next episode

130
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,920
The broken promise
