1
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:21,764
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,573
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:29,205
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,806
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,412
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:46,329
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:55,701
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,675 --> 00:01:06,482
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:15,959
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:21,089
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,125
I'm exhausted!

12
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:50,892
Important solo mission, my butt!

13
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,495
They just didn't have enough manpower
for the castle restoration.

14
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,397
That's not the job of a Shinobi.

15
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:03,865
Ow ow... I won't hold up if
I don't rest somewhere.

16
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh!

17
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,343
I'll take a bath.
Here I go!

18
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,083
Hey...
I'm sounding like an old man.

19
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,748
Wh What?!

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,724
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

21
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,580
Thank you.

22
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,051
Who the heck are you, mister?

23
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:56,689
I'm a Delivery Ninja!

24
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:03,097
<i>Please, Mr. Postman!</i>

25
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,694
23, 24, 25...

26
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,199
26...

27
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,039
No mistake...

28
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:13,809
Thanks to you Mister Naruto,
all of the postal articles are safe.

29
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,339
By the way, what's a Delivery Ninja?

30
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,343
We are postal professionals
who risk our lives

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,287
to deliver the important parcels
our customers have left with us.

32
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:25,754
In other words, you're a postman.

33
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:27,457
I am a Delivery Ninja!

34
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,553
Ordinary postmen don't risk their lives.

35
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,291
So you're an awesome postman, huh?

36
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,593
That's right.

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,531
Oops, I must not keep
my customers waiting.

38
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,537
Then, I'll be on my way...

39
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:44,306
Mister! What's your name?!

40
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,805
I'm 59603.

41
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,108
A zip code...?!

42
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:59,249
Anywhere would be fine
if I can get in a hot spring...

43
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,888
Cripes...
Here it's still day time and...

44
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,224
That voice...

45
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,166
My, you're a strange one, Jira chan.

46
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,530
Am I?

47
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,729
Ah, Pervy Sage!

48
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:17,603
What?! Who's a Pervy Sage...?!

49
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:24,945
What's the meaning of this,
Pervy Sage?!

50
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:28,285
Hadn't you left the village
on an important mission?

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,019
That's why I was being patient
about you training with me!

52
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,086
If you've got the free time to be
doing something like this,

53
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,320
help out with my training right now!

54
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:39,487
W Wait, Naruto.
There's a reason for this...

55
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,191
You probably have some glib lies
about gathering information or something.

56
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,236
You're wrong, you're wrong.
It's data collection, data collection...

57
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:46,902
You see...

58
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,300
It's my final spurt

59
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,706
for the manuscript of the final volume
of "Make Out Violence."

60
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,642
What about the mission...?

61
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:57,081
Well, you see, I'm on a mission.

62
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,147
So don't worry...

63
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,649
What kind of mission?

64
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,852
As it happens, I received information
that a member of the Akatsuki Organization

65
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:11,657
will be visiting this town
the day after tomorrow.

66
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,961
The Akatsuki Organization!
Then, that Itachi will be...?

67
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:19,235
I don't know that.
And the same goes for their purpose...

68
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,605
But that's a matter until
the day after tomorrow.

69
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:26,775
And so, I'm making effective use
of the free time!

70
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:30,880
Then it's perfect.
Give me some training!

71
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,519
Well... you see, they're so insistent
about the manuscript.

72
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,156
I ended up promising the publisher
that I'd send it today or tomorrow.

73
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,026
Come on! It's a long awaited chance
for training.

74
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,562
If my manuscript were
to be completed early,

75
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:49,226
I might be able to take
some time for training.

76
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,739
Oh, my shoulders are stiff!

77
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:00,778
There, there.

78
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,944
Oh, I'm thirsty!

79
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:07,415
Here you go.

80
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:11,752
Hot!

81
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:15,317
Hey, the ideas I just about had
have blown away!

82
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:16,720
Enough!

83
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,024
I'm taking a bath!

84
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,235
What a hard Sensei to please...

85
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,671
<i>I bet he's going to say</i>
<i>this is data collection, anyway.</i>

86
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:33,277
We must deliver that secret document

87
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:35,540
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs,
no matter what the cost...

88
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,008
It seems this is where
the Delivery Ninjas always stay.

89
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,279
Oh, they could...

90
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,245
Delivery Ninja?

91
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:46,119
I can see them now.

92
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,761
This is all I need for
my writing desire to well up...

93
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,461
I'm not getting... inspired with this...

94
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,999
Imagining with your head
is a writer's job, isn't it?

95
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:05,641
I'm a writer rooted in realism!
Getting a picture is important.

96
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:07,406
So I wonder if you'd do <i>that</i> for me.

97
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,240
Can you write if I do <i>that?</i>

98
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,781
I'll write, I'll write!

99
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:14,777
Sexy Jutsu:
Steam Bath Harem Version!

100
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,159
- Master Jiraiya. Jiraiya!
- This is great!

101
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,454
Won der ful!

102
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:37,605
What a hopeless guy!

103
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,908
He hasn't been able to write at all!

104
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,167
Address, check!
Zip code, check!

105
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,601
Ow ow ow...

106
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,376
Oh, the sealed documents...

107
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:20,746
Please take extra care with this.

108
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,711
I will take it for you.

109
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:26,315
Ow ow ow...

110
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,693
Excuse me, can I also ask you
to take this for me?

111
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:35,364
Oh! Mister Naruto.
Thank you for helping me out yesterday.

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,124
Oh! Mister!

113
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:42,640
I am 59603.

114
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,476
It's hard to remember!

115
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,576
More importantly, I want to ask you
to take care of this!

116
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,009
Hmm... This goes in a different direction...

117
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,315
Have a heart. Please.

118
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,784
Oh, perfect timing.

119
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,821
Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?

120
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,717
He is 463-72.

121
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:06,760
This area should be in your jurisdiction.

122
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,157
It is.

123
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:13,570
Then I leave it to you...
What was it again?

124
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:16,006
I am 46372.

125
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,934
Hurry, okay?

126
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,041
Wake up...

127
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,612
Whoa! I fell asleep!

128
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,976
Pervy Sage, let's start training!

129
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:31,883
What're you talking about?
I must complete the manuscript...

130
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,855
You don't need to worry
about that.

131
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,328
I wrote the manuscript and
sent it to the publisher!

132
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:44,233
So now you can devote
yourself freely to training...

133
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,599
Right, Pervy Sage!?

134
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,967
You idiot!

135
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:47,470
Huh?

136
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,400
If something like this were read,
it'll be the end of my writing career!

137
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,273
Ah... Oh... I'm sorry.

138
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:57,778
You said you sent it to
the publisher, right? How?

139
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:00,850
I gave it to a Delivery Ninja
in the inn...

140
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,183
D-Delivery Ninjas.

141
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:08,358
You mean, the one that delivers any
parcel to the addressee, no matter what...

142
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:12,863
not influenced by any land or institution...
<i>that</i> iron organization?!

143
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,360
After him, Naruto.

144
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,632
We'll chase down the Delivery Ninja,
no matter what...

145
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,899
and retrieve your manuscript
at any cost!

146
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,652
<i>If he's going to the publisher,</i>
<i>he should definitely take this path.</i>

147
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:39,419
<i>Now what's left is how to</i>
<i>close the time gap...</i>

148
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,090
I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas
is extraordinary, though...

149
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:44,886
Pervy Sage!

150
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,028
Slow down the pace a little, man.

151
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,359
Naruto! This is also training!

152
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,466
To be straight, you're short on leg power!

153
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,173
A Ninja must apply oneself,

154
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,369
connecting this with training,
no matter what the situation!

155
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,108
Excellent, Pervy Sage.
Now you're talking!

156
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,516
It's just like a maze!

157
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:12,783
We're totally lost...

158
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:16,624
If we had Hinata's or Neji's Byakugan
at a time like this...

159
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,227
Byakugan! I didn't think of that!

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,797
That's the Rasengan, isn't it?!

161
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:40,143
I'm sorry!

162
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,412
Uh, no, you see...!

163
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,788
This isn't the time to be drooling!

164
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:47,922
There he is!

165
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,318
After him, Naruto.

166
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,994
R-Right!

167
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:58,063
Thieves!

168
00:11:58,503 --> 00:11:59,936
Hey, wait!

169
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,972
There's no fool who'd wait
after being told to wait!

170
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:03,973
As it happens,

171
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:07,739
the parcel this person here
left with you this morning is a slip up!

172
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,336
That's right!

173
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,411
I have no knowledge of that.

174
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,445
The rule for us Delivery Ninjas

175
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,349
is to deliver parcels once left
with us to the destination,

176
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,183
even if we have to risk our lives!

177
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,691
My life as a writer is also at risk!

178
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:20,759
Don't look at me.

179
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,124
This is trouble!

180
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:23,816
Sorry.

181
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,104
To do that to someone
who's doing honest work...

182
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,800
Shut up! When you get right down to it,
it was you who...

183
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,604
Huh?! What's this?!

184
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,703
This isn't the thing you wrote!

185
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:44,571
Oh!

186
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:50,518
That time! It got switched with
my manuscript!

187
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:51,847
Say what?!

188
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,784
This is... a secret document directed

189
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,123
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs
from the Land of Claws...

190
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,327
Let me see...
According to the information I've gotten,

191
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:04,801
the Fang and the Claw could go
to war at any moment...

192
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,162
This is a secret document for peace!

193
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,135
They've decided on peace?!
It's written here.

194
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:15,440
That's a good thing, isn't it?!
War is no good!

195
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:19,811
You! You idiot! The fact that
this secret document is here means

196
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:24,218
the manuscript you wrote is being taken
to the Land of Fangs!

197
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,522
What'll happen if they read it as
a secret document

198
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:28,524
from the Land of Claws?

199
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,021
This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!

200
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:34,097
We're going to the Land of Fangs!

201
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,698
R-Right!

202
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,094
This time for sure we'll take back
the manuscript!

203
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:49,305
Postal thieves...
my customer's important parcel...!

204
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,746
This is bad!

205
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:04,085
<i>This is 46372. This is 46372!</i>

206
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,393
<i>A postal robbery has occurred!</i>

207
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,693
<i>The thieves are a pair,</i>

208
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,564
<i>a large man with a perverted look</i>
<i>and a kid!</i>

209
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:15,998
"They appear to be after 596-03's parcel."

210
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:20,640
"Members in the area are assigned
to protect 596-03!"

211
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,945
"Stop the thieves in the name
of the Delivery Ninja!"

212
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:34,120
The only way to get to the Land of Fangs
is to go up this river.

213
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,918
More than likely they will also go
by boat.

214
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:40,426
Then depending on our speed,
there's a chance we'll catch up.

215
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:43,423
I'm the one who's got it rough.

216
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:45,196
You don't have enough physical strength!

217
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,838
Consider this also as training
and apply yourself!

218
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,002
That again?!

219
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:05,787
Who're those guys?!

220
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,722
It appears reinforcements
have been summoned.

221
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:08,790
Hurry, Naruto!

222
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:25,875
Naruto! Switch places!

223
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:37,780
Rasengan!

224
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,485
Rasengan!

225
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:46,462
Somehow... the Rasengan looks like
a really cheap Jutsu...

226
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,427
It's for the sake of preventing a war!

227
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,524
Our mission of peace is at stake!

228
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,737
- Right!
- Switch.

229
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,166
Huh?

230
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:58,769
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

231
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:03,811
Rasengan!

232
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:06,909
Rasengan!

233
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,978
Rasengan!

234
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,820
That's it!

235
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,258
Hey, wait! It's a slip-up!
This is the real one!

236
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:19,194
They got switched during the commission!

237
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,357
Delivery Ninja old man,
it's the truth!

238
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,426
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:28,663
According to our rule,
we are never to look inside

240
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,039
a customer's parcel we have taken on,
no matter what.

241
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,211
If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,

242
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,746
there will be war!

243
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:40,008
Even if that were the case,
I must not break the rule.

244
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,048
You're impossible!

245
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:44,219
It's the Land of Fangs!

246
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:53,655
All we do is carry out our duties!

247
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:56,891
Then... we'll take it away
by force if we have to.

248
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,865
- Postal delivery!
- Postal delivery!

249
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:04,232
Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!

250
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:05,606
No, I don't!

251
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,313
<i>I am 59603.</i>

252
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,709
I know! It's 59603!

253
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:16,380
Where is he?!

254
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,155
Up there!

255
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:28,131
Naruto, you hold back the front!
I'll rout the rest!

256
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,597
Got it!

257
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,470
I won't let you go past here!

258
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:46,077
In the name of the Delivery Ninja,

259
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,551
I will not let anyone interfere!

260
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:51,121
You're an impressive old man...

261
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:54,191
I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,

262
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,693
will take away the manuscript
with a Jutsu!

263
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:58,729
Let's go!

264
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:01,531
Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!

265
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,131
Mis ter De li very Nin ja.

266
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,181
No, no! This isn't the time to be
doing something like this.

267
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,086
Now, to get cracking with my delivery.

268
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,398
Deliver...

269
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,064
I <i>will</i> deliver.

270
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,964
Hey, where are you going?
Play with me.

271
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:47,874
No, no! Not that way.

272
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,645
<i>I'll do my best!</i>

273
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:53,917
Guys! Give me a hand!

274
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,417
- Right! Yeah.
- Okay!

275
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,206
P-P-Postal delivery.

276
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,433
Okay, good work.

277
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,718
<i>This guy's iron will is the real deal...</i>

278
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,159
We're too late, huh...?

279
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,360
Is war going to start?!

280
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,668
Th This is!

281
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:57,413
It's a manuscript of the latest issue
of the Make Out series!

282
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:02,185
That Land of Claws feudal lord...!

283
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:07,020
To think he'd know I was a big fan
of the Make Out series!

284
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:08,723
Everyone!

285
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,288
Stop the fighting!

286
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,990
Send a messenger to
the Land of Claws!

287
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,698
Don't let anybody in...

288
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,899
I kind of don't really get it, but...
with this, there'll be no war?

289
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,867
No war is fine...

290
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:29,108
But does this mean my writing power
is the same as Naruto's scribbling...?!

291
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,545
Now then!

292
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,891
Today's the day the Akatsuki Organization
guy comes!

293
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,317
We'll capture him no matter what
and get information about Sasuke...

294
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:46,056
Pervy Saget?

295
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:53,664
<i>Sorry, Naruto. There was a development</i>
<i>while you were sleeping.</i>

296
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:56,206
<i>I will pursue</i>
<i>the Akatsuki Organization as is.</i>

297
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:01,939
I've been had!

298
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:13,385
Well... I suppose it made for
some good training...

299
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:34,409
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

300
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:38,211
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

301
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,816
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

302
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,819
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

303
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:47,882
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

304
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:50,460
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

305
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,720
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

306
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:55,595
<i>The images.</i>

307
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,605
<i>It probably will not end</i>

308
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:09,001
<i>It probably will not end</i>

309
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:13,851
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

310
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:16,877
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

311
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>Running freely</i>

312
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,552
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

313
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:26,653
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

314
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:29,632
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

315
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:36,237
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

316
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,508
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

317
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:43,013
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

318
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:53,246
All right, everyone, follow me.

319
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:53,756
Wait.

320
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:55,985
We're heading for
the Village Hidden in Stars

321
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,119
on a mission to protect
a mysterious star.

322
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:58,820
Naruto!

323
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,261
Man, I'm getting fired up.

324
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,465
We all need to work together here.

325
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:05,798
Now, let's all unite and show
the boundless power of the Leaf.

326
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,169
Hey, don't be following us like
it's matter of course, Naruto.

327
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,541
You're not listed as
a member for this mission.

328
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,445
Next time:
"Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name"
