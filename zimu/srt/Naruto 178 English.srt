1
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,898
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:26,708
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,340
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,941
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:36,546
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:46,464
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:55,835
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:06,617
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:16,093
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,223
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:52,154
<i>Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name</i>

12
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:23,283
Shizune!

13
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:25,855
Is anything wrong?!

14
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,267
What is it...?

15
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,371
It's a protection commission
from the Village Hidden in the Stars.

16
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:46,577
Is there some kind
of problem with that?

17
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,880
You've never heard about it, Shizune?

18
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:52,683
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is small in terms of scale,

19
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:56,210
but they are very proud and
have often caused trouble...

20
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,754
So, will you accept?

21
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,959
I can't simply disregard it.

22
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:02,987
What...?

23
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,960
Since you know what
is in that village.

24
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:23,109
And it seems they'll form
a three man team

25
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,843
with Neji as the squad leader.

26
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:29,681
But the Village Hidden in the Stars
is a Shinobi village, isn't it?

27
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,915
Then they should do
their own protecting

28
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,653
without asking others.

29
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,329
There are often instances
of a small village

30
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:41,094
with friendly relations
seeking cooperation.

31
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,936
In particular, that village is small

32
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:46,563
and it seems there aren't
that many Shinobi.

33
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:51,170
No kidding. But why's a place
like that being targeted?

34
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:54,580
Actually...!

35
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,415
It all happened 200 years ago.

36
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,823
A star fell in the village!

37
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:12,430
Those stars like in the sky,
not ninja stars or something?!

38
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,062
Right! It seems
there's a mysterious power in the star

39
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,659
that has an effect on Chakra!

40
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:22,300
That's a superstition!

41
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:26,067
In the first place, no way has
a star ever come falling down!

42
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:27,935
It's true!

43
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,477
It's actually been targeted
several times until now

44
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,211
by Shinobi of other lands.

45
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,852
By Shinobi of other lands?

46
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,354
<i>Mysterious power, huh?</i>

47
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:42,017
<i>Indeed, it does seem that someone</i>
<i>like Orochimaru would target it...</i>

48
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,163
All right, I guess I'll be participating
in this one too!

49
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,527
What?! But the three man team's
already been determined.

50
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,637
I've got an ace up my sleeve...

51
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,072
Amaguriama Sweet Shop

52
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:04,911
Listen up. I'll take the lead from here.

53
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,184
There's danger before
entering the village.

54
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:08,481
Okay, got it!

55
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,254
Hi, guys!

56
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:13,152
I'll go on ahead and be waiting!

57
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,554
Naruto! Hold it!

58
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:16,154
That idiot!

59
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:19,160
Umm, what's Naruto doing
in a place like this?

60
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,293
Like I know.

61
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,859
Lady Tsunade, there was a report

62
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,926
that Naruto has joined up
with Neji' s squad.

63
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,901
Yes. I added him to
the Village Hidden in the Stars mission.

64
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,802
Why...?!

65
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:32,071
Those four proved themselves
in the Katabami Gold Mine...

66
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:33,578
and things will quiet down
in the village here, too.

67
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,308
You'd change an already determined
three-man squad just for that reason?!

68
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:39,679
Lady Tsunade?!

69
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:47,414
Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly
with gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?

70
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:51,425
<i>Could it be that was from Naruto...?</i>

71
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,863
Tea! Hurry!

72
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:54,752
Mizura!

73
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:55,555
You okay?!

74
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:57,092
I'm fine...

75
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:00,021
I told you not to push yourself!

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,167
But, I don't want to fall behind
everyone's training...

77
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:08,364
What're you doing
during your training?!

78
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,808
Mizura suddenly keeled
over in pain...

79
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,504
Take him to the medical treatment room.

80
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:13,336
Yes sir.

81
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:14,609
I'll go, too.

82
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,248
Hokuto by herself is
enough for an escort.

83
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,352
Sumaru, you have a mission.

84
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,394
All right! I'm here first!

85
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,331
Once I cross this valley,
I'll be in the Land of Bears.

86
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:36,363
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is close.

87
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:43,565
Wha?!

88
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:10,364
You little...!

89
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,593
Ninja Art: Kujaku...

90
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:14,737
Protection!

91
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,210
This guy blocked Kunai knives
with Chakra!

92
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:19,837
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

93
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,473
Cut!

94
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:29,520
Damn it!

95
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,557
<i>Incredible Chakra!</i>

96
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:52,775
Wait!

97
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:55,776
This guy's an enemy...
He suddenly attacked!

98
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:01,947
You're Leaf Shinobi, right?

99
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:08,587
Are you from
the Village Hidden in the Stars?

100
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm Sumaru.
I came to pick you guys up.

101
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,495
Then why did you do such a thing...?

102
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:16,230
Look at that.

103
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:21,863
Huh?

104
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:45,457
The border of the Land of Bears
is constantly filled with poison gas.

105
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,592
It's also serves as
a natural fortress

106
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,498
against invasion from other lands.

107
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,738
So this is the danger
you were talking about, huh?

108
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:57,369
Isn't that great, Naruto?
You owe Sumaru your life!

109
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,745
It's the beginning of
a beautiful friendship

110
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,370
between the Leaf
and the Hidden Star Village.

111
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:05,043
Give me a break.

112
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:07,376
Was it none of my concern?

113
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,247
I could have just watched
and not done anything...

114
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:38,105
I am Akahoshi

115
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:40,618
and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage
of the Village Hidden in the Stars.

116
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:42,548
Deputy... Hoshikaget?

117
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:47,356
Due to the sudden passing
of the Third Hoshikage one year ago,

118
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:50,054
presently there is
no Hoshikage in this village...

119
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:53,091
But, I heard the only ones who can
refer to themselves as a Kage

120
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:54,894
are the leaders of
the Five Great Hidden Villages...

121
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,795
That doesn't make any difference!

122
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:01,298
We are not inferior to you guys!

123
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,776
Even if we're small now,
this village will someday rival

124
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,040
the Hidden Villages of
the Five Great Nations!

125
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,707
At that time,
I'll become the true Hoshikage!

126
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,675
Silence!

127
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,947
Go back to the training ground.

128
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,358
H-Hey, wait up!

129
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:25,595
Oh! Naruto!

130
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:27,020
Naruto!

131
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,598
Now of all times!

132
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:34,199
Don't worry about him.
Please continue your story.

133
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:37,573
Forgive me.

134
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:41,212
As you say, the Shinobi in our village
are not qualified

135
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,145
to refer to themselves as a Kage.

136
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:47,242
However, in this village,
there is the star

137
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,287
that all the Kage in the Five
Great Hidden Villages also envy.

138
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:51,722
We will use the power
of the star and someday,

139
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,726
this can become a village which can
claim the Sixth Kage title.

140
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,127
So that star is being targeted, right?

141
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,662
Yes. Our search team
obtained some information.

142
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:07,697
Where'd that guy go?

143
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,080
Hey!

144
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,219
I finally caught up.
Was your name Omaru?

145
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,064
Not Omaru, Sumaru.

146
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,531
Oh, sorry, sorry.

147
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,369
But Sumaru's sure
an interesting name.

148
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:42,071
It's another name for
the star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.

149
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:46,343
Everyone in this village bas
a name associated with stars.

150
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,511
After all, this is a village
where a star fell.

151
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,208
I see...

152
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,112
What're you trying to elicit from me?

153
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,988
What? Nothing in particular.

154
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,186
I hadn't thanked you for earlier, so.

155
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:02,289
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround...

156
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,020
The people from other lands
are all after the star.

157
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,489
If you have that power,

158
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,865
you can stand above all
of the Hidden Villages, so...

159
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,597
Is your awesome Chakra
also the power of the star?

160
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,771
If they had that star,

161
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,971
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?

162
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,140
No! The more tremendous the pow er,

163
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,945
the more hard work is required
to control it!

164
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:28,950
I'll work hard, work hard, work hard!

165
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,289
I'll become the Hoshikage!

166
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:34,056
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!

167
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:34,985
Huh?

168
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,788
I'm also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!

169
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:41,658
You're a strange guy.

170
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:42,964
Really?

171
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:44,890
Intruder!

172
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:46,787
Protect the star!

173
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:56,935
But they really are collapsed entirely
from the center towards the outside.

174
00:15:57,142 --> 00:16:00,737
When a star explodes in mid air,
it seems they collapse like this.

175
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:04,415
That's the training area
where the star is enshrined.

176
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,384
Hurry up and show me the star.

177
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:13,250
No. People from other lands
aren't allowed beyond this spot.

178
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,959
But the star is over there, right?

179
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:19,420
I can't protect it
if I can't get close to it!

180
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:22,396
It's not like we trust you guys.

181
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:26,000
Geez, you're such a suspicious guy!

182
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:29,500
Why can't you trust us
who came here on a mission?!

183
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,073
This is my personality, you see.

184
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,715
It can't be?! No way.

185
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:41,712
I'll chase him down!

186
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,220
You go to your friends
in the training area.

187
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:47,188
Hurry!

188
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:50,385
Right. Okay.

189
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:01,468
Hokuto!

190
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,609
Sumaru... I'm sorry.

191
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,280
We couldn't protect the star...

192
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:22,619
You little!

193
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,364
It's ridiculous to do something
like steal in someone else's village

194
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,700
in broad daylight, you little thief!

195
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,366
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

196
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,476
Now, I won't let you getaway!

197
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:52,290
Ninja Art: Kujaku...

198
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,455
This Chakra?!

199
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:02,395
Beast!

200
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,841
Uh, oh! Move away!

201
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:19,742
Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu
towards that monster!

202
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,117
It's futile!

203
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,990
This is my real target!

204
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:37,933
I found your weak point.

205
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:41,570
The main body doesn't move
while controlling the Chakra!

206
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,732
Let's go! Clone Body Slam!

207
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:52,346
There are more ways to
use my Chakra!

208
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:15,272
That one hit hard.

209
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,614
Synthesis!

210
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:31,189
Damn...

211
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:35,960
Naruto!

212
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:47,605
Wings!

213
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,357
You can fly?!

214
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:22,501
You let him get away.

215
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:24,508
I'm sorry. But...

216
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,541
It was my mistake for
leaving it to you.

217
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,710
But as for him,
he used the same Ninja Art as you.

218
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,986
What's the meaning of this?!

219
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,051
Only those who perform
the star training

220
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,027
can use that Ninja Art...

221
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:48,193
Then you're saying
he's someone from this village?

222
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,133
I don't know...

223
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,246
I'm the one who let him get away.

224
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:08,578
I'll get the star back, no matter what!

225
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,410
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

226
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:38,211
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

227
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,817
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

228
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,820
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

229
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:47,882
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

230
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:50,461
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

231
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,720
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

232
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,596
<i>The images.</i>

233
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,606
<i>It probably will not end</i>

234
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:09,002
<i>It probably will not end</i>

235
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:13,779
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

236
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:16,878
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

237
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>Running freely</i>

238
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,552
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

239
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:26,654
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

240
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,633
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

241
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:36,238
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

242
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:39,500
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

243
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:43,036
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

244
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:53,919
I'm kind of bothered by
the village leader's attitude.

245
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,550
That the opponent used
the Ninja Art: Kujaku means...

246
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:59,788
Yeah, the attacker is definitely
a Shinobi from this village.

247
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,992
But, that old man didn't say anything.

248
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,830
It looks like there's some kind
of secret.

249
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:07,336
We need to investigate him.
Let's all split up.

250
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,303
Roger!

251
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:12,031
I'll get that star back,
no matter what.

252
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:15,378
Next: "The Remembered Lullaby"
