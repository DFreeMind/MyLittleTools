1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,292
Summoning Jutsu!

2
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,279
Oh, long time no see.

3
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,745
We don't have much time
to get nostalgic.

4
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:25,484
We've got a mission.

5
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:32,483
That I see over there
is the Village of Artisans, isn't it?

6
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,159
Yeah. It's a village of professionals
who develop Ninja tools.

7
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:39,023
The exceptional Ninja tools
they develop are also

8
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,863
supplied to us
in the Five Great Nations...

9
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,300
But there's been
a strange rumor recently.

10
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,304
A strange rumor?

11
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:50,106
Something about them developing
the ultimate weapon

12
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,043
and attempting to antagonize
the Five Great Nations.

13
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:56,881
In other words, we should
search the village and...

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,353
verify whether or not
there is that ultimate weapon, right?

15
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:02,721
That's about the size of it.

16
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:04,617
Piece of cake.

17
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:40,924
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

18
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,677
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

19
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:06,549
<i>because we were always together</i>

20
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:12,649
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

21
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:18,254
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

22
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:24,936
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

23
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:31,910
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

24
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:44,549
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

25
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:50,959
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

26
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,161
<i>Our two hearts</i>

27
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,289
Hey! Something strange is going on.

28
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:18,958
What is it?!

29
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,524
There's not a soul in the village!

30
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,227
I also found something terrible
on top of that.

31
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:25,598
What?!

32
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:33,839
It's that.

33
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,776
The coffin of Seimei, the founder of
the Village of Artisans.

34
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,303
Even his body is...

35
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,646
This is serious.

36
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,645
<i>The artisans abandoned their village.</i>
<i>Where in the world did they go?</i>

37
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,855
<i>The Targeted Shukaku</i>

38
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,864
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

39
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,300
Maybe I'll treat myself and have
two eggs in my ramen today.

40
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:13,879
Huh?

41
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:20,886
What's going on there?!

42
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,350
Did I keep you waiting by any chance?

43
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,216
Not really. I just got here a bit before.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,521
That's good... Then, here.

45
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,228
I made sure to hand it to you.

46
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,490
Yeah, yeah. What a pain.

47
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:37,893
Just a minute!

48
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,103
What're you guys doing...

49
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:43,734
all in secret in a place like this
without even asking me?!

50
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,437
- Naruto?
- Huh?

51
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:48,208
You're terrible, just terrible, Sakura!

52
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,746
Here you won't even go out
on a date with me at all!

53
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,015
Why're you talking gibberish
all of a sudden?

54
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,916
Ouch ouch ouch ouch...

55
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,249
An errand for the Old Lady?

56
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:04,027
Yes. It seems a new poison
was discovered or something.

57
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,966
I delivered a list of
research medicinal substance

58
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,433
for Shikamaru's father to prepare.

59
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,025
Oh, that's it?!

60
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,934
Jeez, you jump to conclusions.

61
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,063
Oh, come to think of it,

62
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:19,237
an update report from Temari
has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.

63
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,108
An update report?

64
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:22,673
So? What exactly?

65
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,353
I heard that the Village Hidden in
the Sand started Ninja education,

66
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:29,651
imitating the curriculum program
of the Leaf's.

67
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,653
It seems that Temari and her brothers
are working as instructors.

68
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,118
Instructors?!

69
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,962
Is that harsh woman fit to be
something like an instructor...?

70
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,065
Really? That Gaara, huh?

71
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,137
This is hands on training.

72
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,774
Choose from among these
a Ninja tool that suits you.

73
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:00,619
What is it?

74
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:05,750
Do w e absolutely have to choose?!

75
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,527
What do you mean?

76
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:13,094
We'll end up hurting the other person
if we use a weapon.

77
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,528
We might kill them.

78
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,095
A weapon is...

79
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,413
No, never mind...

80
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,653
A mission isn't a game.

81
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,426
If you were to enter a field of battle
with that frame of mind, you'd die.

82
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,295
I I'm sorry.

83
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:47,866
You got Gaara angry because
you ask stupid questions.

84
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,168
You are in trouble.

85
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,342
The three of us will conduct
hands on training.

86
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,035
Gather in the respective class
of your choice.

87
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:04,178
Gaara, put a smile on!

88
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,982
They'll get scared and nobody will
choose you with that sulky look.

89
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:13,988
My dad said that Gaara
was the Sand's ultimate weapon.

90
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:18,491
Yeah. He's so powerful that the village
would be destroyed, if he got mad.

91
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:21,223
He's scary, so let's not bother.

92
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,295
All right, I'm with Temari.

93
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,768
I'll be with Kankuro!

94
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:27,203
- Me too!
- Me too!

95
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:28,963
- Me too!
- Me too!

96
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:31,165
Please be my teacher.

97
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:41,385
<i>Earlier, he was trying to</i>
<i>teach me something...</i>

98
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,292
Excuse me... Please be my teacher.

99
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,430
Are you okay with me?

100
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,235
Please teach me!

101
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,930
This is cool.

102
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,509
That's too big!

103
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,336
I'll take this.

104
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,296
What's your name?

105
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,024
I'm Matsuri.

106
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:28,523
Matsuri, choose a weapon.

107
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,425
What's the matter?

108
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:03,334
Come at me with that weapon
with the intent to kill me.

109
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:04,592
Yes, sir...

110
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:12,044
They say an ogre with Iron Club
is invincible. But you are no ogre.

111
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,808
Yes, sir. Please tell me
what I should choose.

112
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:24,916
The weapon called the Rope Javelin.

113
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,516
Rope Javelin...

114
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,925
The sharp blade on the end of the rope

115
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:39,370
is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,
rather than for attack.

116
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:43,000
And you seal off an enemy's movement
with the rope.

117
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:50,380
Practice until you can control it
as a part of your body.

118
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:51,850
Yes, sir!

119
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,071
Damn. Who are you guys?!

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,378
Is this all
the Sand Village Shinobi have?

121
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,125
Wait.

122
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:37,494
Leave this guy alive.
We can use him to draw that one out.

123
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:48,272
Hang in there! What is it?!
What happened?

124
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,771
Take me to Gaara... Quickly.

125
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:24,443
What's the matter?

126
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,247
My mother and father were hit with
countless weapons right in front of me.

127
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,310
So I...

128
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,585
For what purpose
do you hold a weapon?

129
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:39,648
He...

130
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:42,826
<i>What are...</i>

131
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,057
<i>...these two to you?!</i>

132
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:52,128
<i>Th These guys are...</i>

133
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,069
<i>...my friends!</i>

134
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:57,335
<i>Try laying so much as</i>
<i>another finger on them!</i>

135
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,803
<i>I'll clobber you!</i>

136
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:02,774
He said that to me.

137
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,750
That's what we're after: Gaara.

138
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,395
Gaara, we were
just coming to get you.

139
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,504
The patrol Ninja was
attacked by somebody.

140
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:29,431
Guys calling themselves
The Four Celestials

141
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:34,104
brandishing strange weapons,
said to tell Gaara that...

142
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:40,117
"We declare a challengerto you,
the ultimate weapon.

143
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,284
"If you don't accept the challenge,

144
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:48,383
"we will take away one person
close to you every day...

145
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,655
"and they shall
pay the price for you."

146
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,769
You there.

147
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,998
Are you Gaara's student?

148
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,011
You shall be the first sacrifice.

149
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,660
What's this Rope Javelin?!

150
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:30,836
Wait!

151
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:36,773
The enemy went northeast...

152
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,910
Matsuri has become a first sacrifice...

153
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:42,908
But the real target of the guys who
call themselves the Four Celestials is...

154
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:44,313
you, Gaara.

155
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:45,784
Yeah...

156
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,550
This must be brought to
a Jonin Council at once...

157
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,530
In the northeastern direction

158
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:02,431
where the ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials left,

159
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,765
there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,

160
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:06,464
with the Land of Rivers
sandwiched between.

161
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:10,340
Therefore, w e will be requesting
the assistance of the Leaf...

162
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:14,136
Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.

163
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,377
Form a unit and prepare for
pursuit immediately.

164
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,352
Hold it.

165
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,413
The enemy is after Gaara.

166
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:25,948
That would be like walking
right into a trap they laid.

167
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:29,117
That's right.
Why won't you send a party?!

168
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,057
It might be a diversionary tactic
by the enemy.

169
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,663
The village will become shorthanded
if we send out pursuers.

170
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:39,636
Then you at least could
come with us, right, Baki?!

171
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:47,006
Most likely, the enemy is
after Shukaku.

172
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,070
Gaara is the Sand's ultimate weapon.

173
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,550
If we know that...

174
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:57,218
But it's also a dangerous
double-edged sword to the village.

175
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:01,281
If they would do us the favor
facing each other and perishing...

176
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,060
Then at least
I should go with them.

177
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,199
No. You have a different mission.

178
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,328
Just send those three!

179
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,702
Hey, how about it?!

180
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:24,510
I've been given
a different mission, you see...

181
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,644
Go. She's your student, right?

182
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,185
Let's go, Kankuro.

183
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,072
Will it be okay with her?!

184
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,940
She's just a kid.

185
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,572
Will he come?!

186
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:59,350
If he doesn't come, we'll just sacrifice
those close to him one after another.

187
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:04,656
That is...?

188
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,294
It's a message from the Sand Village!

189
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,465
Gaara? Why?

190
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,267
Who knows?
The goal is a challenge to Gaara.

191
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,101
The hostage is a Ninja school student.

192
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,410
The enemy is escaping in the direction of
the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.

193
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:33,982
Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are
chasing after them.

194
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,812
At this point, that's all we know.

195
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:40,851
You want me to set up an operation
to stop the overconfident jerks

196
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:43,861
who challenged Gaara
just with that information?

197
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,760
Yeah. We're on friendly terms
with the Sand Village, so.

198
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,167
Just a minute.

199
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,197
They came during the Sasuke incident
with much less information than now.

200
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,508
Things are more bothersome
than that time!

201
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,136
Our range would widen significantly
if we ambushed them

202
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,770
instead of pursuing them.

203
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,780
There's also the incident in question
in the Village of Artisans,

204
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,647
and the Jonin and Chunin
are all away...

205
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:08,917
- Shizune...
- Yes, ma'am!

206
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,448
Those are the only Genin
we can use now.

207
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:16,217
Take the Genin you want to use

208
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,855
and leave the village
within thirty minutes!

209
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,097
Sakura's name isn't on here.

210
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,027
Yeah. She's doing
Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.

211
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:30,503
I'll accept the mission.
But I have one condition.

212
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,769
Please let me borrow Sakura.

213
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,114
Sakura?

214
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:47,954
It's almost time!
Is this everyone, Shikamaru?!

215
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,419
One person still hasn't come.

216
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,662
Could that be...?

217
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,365
Sorry to keep you waiting!

218
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,528
I can't do a mission hungry.
So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.

219
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,674
What?! That's not fair just you
getting to eat! I'll also...

220
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:07,542
All right! Now we've got
all our members together! We're off!

221
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,778
Huh? What? This is it?!

222
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,309
I'd heard this was an operation
with a mobilization

223
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,647
of the Genin
remaining in the village!

224
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,988
This is everyone, I tell you!

225
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,522
That's messed up!

226
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,785
Setting aside Sakura who's training,

227
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:23,828
there should still be
Shino, Neji and Hinata!

228
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,296
No mistake. It's weird Akamaru and I
being the only Ninja

229
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,890
with search ability.

230
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,826
So is this team
a go for it super attack type?

231
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:36,502
Yeah. I name us
Team Return the Favor.

232
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,470
What lame naming!

233
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,878
The guys from the Sand Village
helped us during the Sasuke incident!

234
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,219
In a manner, this operation will be
returning the favor from that time!

235
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:52,815
All right! Guys, let's make sure to
return the favor from that time.

236
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,250
You're not the leader!

237
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,989
Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader
of this platoon, right?!

238
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:00,424
That's right...

239
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,860
Jeez, then let's settle on a strategy
and get going as soon as possible.

240
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,900
Are we going in one line
as we did for the Sasuke incident?

241
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,469
There's no doubting the conditions
are similar to the Sasuke incident.

242
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:16,675
However, the strategies for pursuit
and ambush are completely different!

243
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,078
We can't follow them with Byakugan
or by using Akamaru's nose.

244
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,713
No mistake about that.

245
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,421
It's unconventional, but since these are
all the people we've got,

246
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:29,156
we'll act in groups of two basis
as Two Man Cells.

247
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:32,088
Solo action is prohibited
no matter what the case!

248
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,865
We owe a debt to the Ninja in
the Sand Village.

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,666
However, although this is to repay a debt,
no way will we produce casualties!

250
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,938
Yeah, I got it.

251
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,609
- Follow me, Ino.
- Right!

252
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,610
Choji, you go with Kiba...

253
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,010
I'm counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.

254
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:56,221
Right...

255
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:58,480
Lee, you're with Naruto...

256
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,987
Right. Please refrain
from selfish actions.

257
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:04,562
You don't need to remind me like that.

258
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:09,127
Also, the four people Naruto mentioned
earlier have left before us.

259
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,569
Four people, do you mean
Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?

260
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:16,499
Yeah. The four will be
going their separate ways

261
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,042
and won't take part in future battles!

262
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,703
Why not?!

263
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,809
Isn't that an incredible waste
of battle strength?!

264
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,412
In place of that, we get a wider range
of search action...

265
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:30,714
And we'll have them focus on
medical action in the case of battle starting.

266
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:35,256
I have been entrusted with your lives
and this is my strategy!

267
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,197
<i>All right, just wait, Gaara!</i>

268
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,394
<i>I'll make sure to return the favor!</i>

269
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:23,471
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

270
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:29,811
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

271
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:39,621
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

272
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:44,219
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

273
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:49,165
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

274
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:54,035
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

275
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:59,009
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

276
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:03,241
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

277
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:07,718
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

278
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:15,124
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

279
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:19,027
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

280
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:24,296
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

281
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:28,430
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

282
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:33,308
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

283
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:38,005
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

284
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:44,147
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

285
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:55,458
One of the enemies uses wind, huh?
Interesting. I will be her opponent!

286
00:22:55,767 --> 00:23:00,101
Then I'll take on the guy who brandishes
the sword that looks like a kid's toy.

287
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,367
We'll take care of this.
You go ahead, Gaara.

288
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,031
But, will it be okay?

289
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:07,940
We don't need your help
to deal with these chumps.

290
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,414
You hurry, Gaara. That girl is
your student, isn't she?

291
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,944
Next time: "Sand A lliance"
with The Leaf Shinobi"
