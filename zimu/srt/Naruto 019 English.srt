Zabuza is dispersed in the snow

19
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,474
Gatoo

20
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:43,702
Why six here?

21
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:45,679
And then

22
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,763
 what are all those men?

23
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:51,947
It has been a small change in the plans.

24
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,251
Me dispiace, Zabuza, but morirai here!

25
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,255
What?

26
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:04,920
If you had contacted a ninja official
beloved would have cost me.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,341
For this I have assumed a ninja fuggitivo like you.

28
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:14,991
If you ended killed I would save
problems and money.

29
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:18,657
You just make me to laugh, and you make yourself to call

30
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:21,086
 il Demon of the Village of the Fog?

31
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:26,328
According to me six solo a poor one demonietto.

32
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,257
How many are?

33
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,260
Indeed infinity.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,545
Kakashi, me dispiace

35
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,944
 but our crash finishes here.

36
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:39,484
From the moment that I do not have more a reason
in order to kill Tazuna

37
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:42,844
 I do not have neanche more reason
in order to fight against of you.

38
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:46,597
Sure one. They are of agreement.

39
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,706
Dimenticavo.

40
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,740
I have an account in suspended with this moccioso

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,457
The arm has tightened me until breaking off it to me.

42
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,074
This is died here.

43
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:08,720
Bastard!!!

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,854
That I haul you are making!

45
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:12,042
Detention!

46
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,526
Not to be much impulsive one!

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,809
D   something also you!

48
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,755
He was a your friend, not!

49
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,799
Taci moccioso.

50
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,329
Haku by now is died.

51
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:25,902
You want dirmi that t' it does not import null
if its body comes treaded on!

52
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:29,348
You two have been always entirety!

53
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,145
As Gatoo has used me

54
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,947
 I used of Haku.

55
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,018
You I have already said

56
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:43,217
 we ninja are only of the instruments.

57
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:48,828
To me he interested its force alone,
not its personality.

58
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,824
I do not have resentments.

59
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:57,884
You say seriously?

60
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,654
Naruto Plants It.

61
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,217
We do not have more to fight against than he.

62
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:03,479
And then

63
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,948
Hush!

64
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,880
It is my adversary!

65
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:12,729
He

66
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,908
He you.

67
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,014
It wanted to you truly well!

68
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:20,536
You have someone of important?

69
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:23,051
Infinitely well!

70
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:28,632
A person becomes truly strongly only when

71
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,598
 she wishes protect something of important.

72
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:35,653
Indeed not tests nothing for he!

73
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:40,004
Me it is difficult to adopt the mentality of the ninja.

74
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,716
Truly

75
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:46,155
Not tests truly null for he!?

76
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,242
I want to esaudire its desires

77
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,534
 and in name its

78
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,099
 I could become pitiless!

79
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:56,555
Becoming forts like you

80
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,770
 forgiveness indeed all the feelings?

81
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,349
It has

82
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,194
It has sacrificed its life for you!

83
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:09,230
Of this person I want to esaudire desires.

84
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,631
This is my dream.

85
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:16,832
Living without to see realizes the own dreams to you

86
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:19,781
I was happy.

87
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,880
 and to die like one instrument

88
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,342
 would be

89
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,748
 too much

90
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:30,255
 too much painful!

91
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:37,744
Marmocchio

92
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:57,855
Not to say nothing more

93
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,015
Haku

94
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,437
It not only fought suffering for me

95
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:10,971
 its heart suffered also for you.

96
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,186
I knew.

97
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:17,074
It was too much good.

98
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:22,892
They are content to have fought
against of you my last battle.

99
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,631
 piccoletto

100
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:35,132
 to the end you had reason.

101
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,126
Also the ninja they are human beings.

102
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:42,641
Probably pu   not to become itself
one instrument without feelings.

103
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:47,943
You have gained.

104
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,432
Marmocchio, gives a kunai to me.

105
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,192
Hour enough, uccideteli all!

106
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,307
Stupid, creeds of being able to win against

107
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,305
All

108
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,950
A demon!

109
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:18,598
If you hold us cos   a lot to catch up your companion

110
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,359
You catch up it alone!

111
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,244
Me dispiace

112
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:27,744
But I do not mean to go

113
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,255
 in the same place of Haku.

114
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,583
That you say!

115
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,830
Tasks perhaps of sopravivere?

116
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:38,123
NOT! Task

117
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:41,133
 to carry to you with me to hell!

118
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,464
Not you tratter   badly.

119
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,817
Also the small Devil
of the Village of the Fog

120
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:51,460
 pu   to become a true demon
once caught up hell!

121
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,871
It waits for it with anxiety.

122
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,188
Laggi you will be able to verify

123
00:08:56,188 --> 00:09:00,276
 if they are only
"the amiable devil" that you say!

124
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,788
Haku

125
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:05,465
 it is hour of dirci goodbye, Haku.

126
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:10,132
Thanks of all

127
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,746
 and it pardons to me.

128
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,279
Not to distogliere the look.

129
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,972
E' the end of a man who
it has lived with all if same.

130
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,301
!

131
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,939
They are died

132
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:41,501
Sasuke-kun

133
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,429
Sakura

134
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,491

00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,560
I!

136
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,142
Sakura

137
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:53,755
Weights a lot

138
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,162
Sasuke-kun

139
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,612
Sasuke-kun

140
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,146
Sasuke-kun!

141
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:07,392
Sasuke-kun!

142
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:10,441
Sakura you make me badly

143
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:14,182
They are happy for you, Sakura.

144
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,000
Not, not to move to you!

145
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:19,360
Dov' Is Naruto?

146
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,084
And that it has succeeded the masked boy?

147
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,749
Naruto is well.

148
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,015
And the masked boy......

149
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,579
 he is died.

150
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,205
Died!

151
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:33,050
Naruto has killed!

152
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,975
 I do not know what has happened esattamete

153
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,916
 but it is died trying protect Zabuza.

154
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,820
Confidavo in you!

155
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,846
Schivato Hai all the mortal attacks them!

156
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,949
From the beginning it has not been never tried to kill to me.

157
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,588
Naruto!

158
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,731
Sakura-chan

159
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:59,181
Sasuke-kun is well! Alive E'!

160
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:00,874
Eh?

161
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:17,640
Haku fought suffering not
only for me but also for you.

162
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,974
It was too much good.

163
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:24,208
Hour I understand its words

164
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,475
I understand, therefore also Sasuke is well.

165
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:29,555
They are content.

166
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,862
Hey, Hey, Hey!

167
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,176
Been you rilassando too much.

168
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,772
Cursed ninja!

169
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,848
You have killed our source of gain!

170
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:42,323
Us it does not remain that to attack the city

171
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:46,045
 and to steal to all the roba of value.

172
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,447
To not it wanted us.

173
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,997
Kakashi-sensei

174
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,830
You do not have no technique
for being able to strike them all together?

175
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,799
Not, I have used too much Chakra.

176
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,751
We go!

177
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:10,150
You still approach yourselves of a step the island

178
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,580

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,930

180
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,555
Inari!

181
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:22,205
The heroes always arrive at the last moment.

182
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,742
Inari

183
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,923

Kage Bunshin not Jutsu!

186
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:46,354
With the Chakra that me remains I would have
to succeed to make a bluff.

187
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,077
Kage Bunshin not Jutsu!

188
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,218

190
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,395
Scappiamooo!!!

191
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,253
Evviva!!!

192
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:31,138
It seems is all ending!?

193
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,835
!

194
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:37,184
Kakashi, you would make a favor me?

195
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,115
Sure one.

196
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,442
I want

197
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:46,397
 to see its face.

198
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,106
Of agreement.

199
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,664
It is snowing

200
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:22,525
Snow in this season?

201
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:33,382
Haku

202
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:36,096
You are crying?

203
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,495
Thanks, Kakashi.

204
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:58,399
Always we have been together

205
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:04,307
 therefore I want to be to yours
flank until the last one

206
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:19,494
 and if possible

207
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:24,514
 I would want to be with you

208
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:28,379
 also after

209
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,626
 the dead women.

210
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,797
Born E'

211
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:58,825
 in a country where often it snowed.

212
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:02,622
For this

213
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,377
 he was a candid child like the snow.

214
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:10,669
Zabuza you will be joined

215
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,263
 also in the afterlife.

216
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,473
Kakashi-sensei, I was thinking

217
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,024
The life of a ninja

218
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:28,383
 are just like said those two?

219
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:35,062
A ninja reason does not have to try one to exist

220
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:39,791
 but to exist like instrument to the service of the country.

221
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,485
This is worth also to Konoha.

222
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:49,382
To become a ninja consists in this?

223
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,345
It is not

224
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:51,622
 that

225
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,052
 me enthusiasms a lot!

226
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,736
And you what of tasks?

227
00:17:56,736 --> 00:18:00,023
Neanche to me

228
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:07,137
E' for that the ninja unconsciously they live
suffering for this aspect of their life.

229
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,604
Like Zabuza

230
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:12,062
 and that child.

231
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:18,589
Well!

232
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:21,522
I have decided!

233
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,910
Diventer   ninja to way mine!

234
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,482
I want to follow my way.

235
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,994
And to make so that it does not have to repent me null!!

236
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,657
Thanks to you we have completed the bridge.

237
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,397
But we are dispiaciuti for your departure.

238
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,005
Good fortune.

239
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,764
Thanks of all.

240
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:55,065
Mass   Tazuna!

241
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:58,754
We will come to still find to you.

242
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,337
You promise?

243
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,152
Ah?

244
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,049
Inari

245
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,635
Six sad, true one?

246
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:12,267
You can cry, if you want.

247
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,597
Piangi.

248
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,016
Not to cry !

249
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,797
If you want you cry, Naruto!

250
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,693
E' that

251
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,282
We go!

252
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,336
That stubborn

253
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:42,741
That boy has changed the feelings of Inari

254
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:46,391
 and Inari has changed the feelings of the citizens.

255
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:54,327
The courage of that boy has made us
from bridge in order to catch up the hope.

256
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,645
Already the bridge

257
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:00,233
We must give a name to this bridge.

258
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,644
True E'.

259
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:06,805
I have the perfect name for this bridge.

260
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,301

262
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,735
E' a beautiful name.

263
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:16,905
Well!

264
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:22,518
We return in a hurry, than cos   I make myself
to offer a ramen from master Iruka for
to celebrate the completion of the mission.

265
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,337
Then I must tell

266
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:27,913

267
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:30,409
Then I

268
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,646
Hey, Sasuke-kun!

269
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,872

Before Cultivate your hunger you idealize.

284
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,739
Motivated your anger to make them all realize.

285
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,856
Climbing the mountain

286
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,192
never coming down.

287
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,342

never falling down

289
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,173
My knee is still shaking

290
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,507
like the was twelve

291
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:55,586
Sneaking out of the classroom

292
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:56,784

Don' t cry ' causes you' king I know right.

298

We are making simple missions alone?

309
00:22:56,714 --> 00:23:01,124
I want to face the ninja strong
of the other countries like Zabuza and Haku.

310
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:05,504
You do not have a mission where it can make beautiful
figure and that it is also moving?

311
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:09,190
I must cover my "way of the ninja",
you know my heart, you know

312
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:14,203
The next time, begins following understood it:
