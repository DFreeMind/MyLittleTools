1
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:36,850
Sasuke's movement has stopped..

2
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,945
But there's still a little ways to go.

3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,618
We finally caught up to him..

4
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:43,767
Sasuke..

5
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:45,251
Alright!

6
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:48,208
This smell..

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,568
What is it?

8
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,696
Did something happen to Sasuke-kun?

9
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,922
I didn't notice until now, but..

10
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,796
You and I use the same shampoo!

11
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,342
That floral green scent..

12
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,257
..there's no mistaking it!

13
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,272
Hey you!

14
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:16,797
But I have shinier hair.

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,422
Don't bring up a ridiculous thing like that now!

16
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:22,800
I use the same as a dog..

17
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,800
- Sorry, sorry.

18
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,063
Same as a dog..

19
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,866
..same as a dog..

20
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,399
..same as a dog?

21
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:28,609
- Sakura-chan?

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,227
Same as a dog..

23
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:36,818
Sakura-chan..

24
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:37,841
wait!

25
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:41,046
Hey! Don't go ahead of me!

26
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:46,091
The mistake of Hokage
The real face under the mask

27
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,301
Shit!

28
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,707
Uchiha.. Sasuke

29
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,436
I won't let you escape.

30
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:04,019
Of all people, this guy shows up while Gaara's in this condition.

31
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,403
This is the worst case scenario.

32
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:11,688
Alright then.

33
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,611
Kankuro, take Gaara and go ahead!

34
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,159
I'll take care of him.

35
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,712
But Temari..

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,664
against him, one opponent isn't enough.

37
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:31,217
Don't worry. This mission is important to the Sand.

38
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:33,634
Gaara is your first priority.

39
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:38,510
Plus, this guy is kind of my type.

40
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,371
Go, Kankuro!

41
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:44,461
I won't let you!

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,799
You won't get away.

43
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,115
Take this!

44
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,750
My opponent is Uchiha.

45
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,315
This is not good..

46
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:05,034
I don't have much chakra left.

47
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:13,049
Also, if he uses the Sharingan that will put me at a big disadvantage.

48
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:17,211
So, I need to get him to use up a lot of his chakra.

49
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,499
Should I quickly finish this with Chidori?

50
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,033
Or..

51
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,647
should I use..

52
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,379
Just as I expected..

53
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,610
He's trying to save chakra for Gaara.

54
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,807
Ninpou - Kamaitachi!

55
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,281
Here it comes!

56
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,328
Quit playing around!

57
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:01,041
Ninpou - Fu Sajin!

58
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,510
Damn it.. I gotta do something about that fan.

59
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,989
I wonder how long he'll last with that style of fighting.

60
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,547
There's no choice.

61
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,671
Finally, he's ready to fight.

62
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,553
Fire element - Hosenka no Jutsu!

63
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,117
That's what I expected.

64
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,981
I'll pinpoint that target.

65
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:55,592
Fire element - Goukakyu no Jutsu!

66
00:05:58,651 --> 00:05:59,893
Did I get her?

67
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:04,053
Kamaitachi!

68
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,099
You fell for it.

69
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:10,578
Now!

70
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,273
I have you!

71
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:23,403
Alright!

72
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:28,267
What? Kawarimi!?

73
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,714
Oh no!

74
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,421
Sorry..

75
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,974
..but I don't have time to play around with you.

76
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,055
Damn it..

77
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,660
No matter what, Gaara needs to be..

78
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:16,920
What is that..

79
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,051
What's going on..

80
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:23,589
Who is that young one?

81
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,592
Who the hell are you!?

82
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:32,122
Is it that much of a shock that you can't figure it out?

83
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:35,453
It's me.. I'm Orochimaru.

84
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,920
Impossible..

85
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,582
You can't have already acheived the completion of that kinjutsu..

86
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:52,475
It's been more than 10 years since I left the village..

87
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,964
You terrifying inhuman creature, you..

88
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,727
That one, he's finally done it..

89
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:12,292
One of the reasons I didn't choose you to be the Yondaime..

90
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,682
..was because of your twisted ideology..

91
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,640
It looks like you've finally found me..

92
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,424
How unfortunate..

93
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,469
Orochimaru..

94
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,694
What is the meaning of this?

95
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:14,569
I laid so many booby traps..

96
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:18,057
enough that I thought I'd be safe..

97
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:21,985
So I was really surprised.. But now I see.

98
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:28,195
Recently, a bunch of ninjas from the genin to chuunin and even some of the ANBU have gone missing..

99
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:33,006
and there have been reports of your strange behavior as well..

100
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:37,393
Orochimaru-sama.. How could you of all shinobi do such a thing?!

101
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,323
Shall I kill you as well?

102
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,979
Orochimaru..

103
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:47,049
So it was you, after all..

104
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,441
Speak!

105
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,577
What were you doing here?

106
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:53,798
Oh, my goodness..

107
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,528
If the cat's out of the bag then..

108
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:01,367
I've been working on developing a jutsu.

109
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:05,390
Orochimaru-sama.. you'd kill your own village's shinobi for that?!

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,424
It's as I thought, kinjutsu..

111
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,365
What on earth did you hope to achieve?

112
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,638
Everything there is.

113
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,273
Everything, you say?

114
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:31,179
I want to obtain all the jutsus and gain a true understanding of everything in this world..

115
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,801
The first person to mix blue and yellow..

116
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,897
..named the new color that was created green.

117
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:42,779
I only want to do the same thing..

118
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:48,736
If blue is the chakra then yellow is the seal, and green is the jutsu..

119
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,114
Just as there is no end to the variety of colors, there are so many thousands..

120
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,921
tens of thousands of jutsu in the world as well..

121
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:05,947
But.. in order to obtain every possible jutsu and truth, it would require an eternity, you see..

122
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:15,029
Only the one who understands everything after spending such time on this can be fittingly called the "ultimate being".

123
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:22,964
For me, the lifespan of the body is too short, too fragile..

124
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:29,951
Even if you were to be called Hokage, when you die everything ends there so..

125
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,369
Orochimaru..

126
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:35,185
This jutsu you're experimenting on here, it can't be..

127
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:38,162
Yes, it's what you think..

128
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,059
The "Spell of Immortality".

129
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:05,660
This immortality jutsu is a spell where you anchor your spirit to this world forever..

130
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:15,645
In other words, it's a reincarnation spell where you find a new body, enter it with your spirit and gain possession of it..

131
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:23,312
The reason why I disguised myself as my old self until now was..

132
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:28,321
because I thought I'd let you feel nostalgic about the past..

133
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:33,400
To grow old.. how destitute it can be..

134
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:37,561
When I look at you I can feel it deeply.

135
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,807
You will die here..

136
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:46,763
and I will obtain an even younger, more beautiful, stronger body..

137
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,442
The Leaf really entertain me to no end..

138
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,099
I see..

139
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:01,118
Uchiha Sasuke.

140
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:13,314
Yes.. that's it exactly..

141
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,521
It's Sasuke-kun

142
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:21,885
A reincarnation jutsu that steals the body of another and makes the spirit immortal..

143
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:26,651
What number face.. body.. is that one!?

144
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:30,109
I believe it's the second one..

145
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:36,379
I intend to possess Sasuke-kun after he grows up a bit more to my tastes..

146
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:46,890
But to have you die, cursing your fate and regretting your entire life..

147
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:51,471
I suppose this face would be best..

148
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,304
You hideous monster!

149
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,870
Hokage-sama!

150
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:17,035
You mustn't let your guard down now, sensei..

151
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,256
You were always too compassionate.

152
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:28,984
What's the matter with you?

153
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,463
This just ain't like you..

154
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,792
Sorry..

155
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,697
His eyes..

156
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,468
Malice and ambition have always been hidden within his eyes.

157
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,324
I have always been aware that he had these qualities.

158
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:17,504
I knew about it but acted as if I couldn't see it..

159
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:21,291
A genius bursting with tremendous abilities..

160
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,275
..in a time that was still chaos because he was, without a doubt..

161
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,671
..a talent you'd find only every few decades.

162
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:35,940
He was the one to carry on my will and strength.. I wanted to think it would be so.

163
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:39,751
And it was this weakness of mine that..

164
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:43,739
..allowed that event and the current situation.

165
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:49,035
Are you going to kill me?

166
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,770
Ninpou - Kuchiyose!

167
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:01,630
I wonder if you can actually do it..

168
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,103
Sarutobi-sensei!

169
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,506
Kill him, Sarutobi!

170
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:24,929
This is your only chance!

171
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,380
Sarutobi.. you..

172
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,989
But I couldn't kill him..

173
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:57,795
I'll kill you now and correct my past mistake!

174
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:02,323
Let's go!

175
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,448
It's already too late!

176
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,656
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

177
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,516
Why is he using the Kage-bunshin?

178
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,410
Why would he distribute the little chakra that remains in him like that?

179
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,357
You've really grown old..

180
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,505
To think you'd shorten your own lifespan out of impatience..

181
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:30,710
It.. it can't be that you..

182
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,019
Mi..

183
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,342
..I..

184
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:32,893
..Hitsuji..

185
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,355
..U..

186
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:33,964
..Inu..

187
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:34,405
..Ne..

188
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:34,987
..Tori..

189
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:35,487
..Uma..

190
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,287
..Mi!

191
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,296
The order of the seals..

192
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:43,005
Sarutobi's going to use that jutsu!

193
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,155
This must be the death that Yondaime spoke of.

194
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:07,649
Only those who form a contract with this jutsu can see it..

195
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,459
It's already too late, no matter what you do.

196
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,333
I have won.

197
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:14,584
Konoha will be demolished!

198
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,959
The Leaf Village is my home!

199
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:24,035
The Hokage is one who continues to act as the main pillar of the house, protecting it!

200
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:28,102
He's the one who carries the will of the Leaf, entrusted with it..

201
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:30,561
..it won't be that easy for you!

202
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,729
Genjutsu - Kokuangyo no Jutsu!

203
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,546
What absurd nonsense..

204
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:51,064
You're just, for a short while, one of the leaders in the history of the organization called Konoha..

205
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:03,902
Even the remains of the rock portrait will eventually fade and crumble.

206
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:09,604
To me, the Leaf Village isn't just an organization..

207
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:19,235
Every year, there are a lot of shinobi born and raised in Konoha.

208
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,435
They live.. fight.. to protect the village..

209
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:55,076
Even if we are not related by blood, those of the village like these are..

210
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:59,689
to me, my most precious..

211
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,132
most important..

212
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:04,835
..family!

213
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:17,444
Well then, I'll break you in half, the main pillar, that is..

214
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:20,877
and that will destroy the house, Konoha.

215
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,253
Even if you were to kill me, the beam won't break!

216
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,561
I'm the man who inherited the will of the Leaf,

217
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:33,999
the will of the Shodaime-sama and Nidaime-sama.

218
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,871
I am the Sandaime Hokage!

219
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:42,295
No matter how much you target the Leaf Village..

220
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,434
there will be a new Hokage who will inherit my will and become the pillar to protect the house of Konoha!

221
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:51,499
Isn't that right Yondaime?

222
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,756
Orochimaru!

223
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:58,413
I'll show you a special jutsu from now that even you don't know about!

224
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:00,736
Take this!

225
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,051
Fuuin Jutsu - Shiki Fuujin!

228
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:53,141
Many ninja are born in the village of Konoha every year as they grow, fight, and die while protecting their home.

229
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:57,812
Even if the people in the village are not blood related..

230
00:22:57,857 --> 00:23:04,327
..they are all important family to me.

231
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:10,708
My family will no longer allow you to have your way!
