2
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:44,513
Jiraiya-sama...

3
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,669
I have faith in you.

4
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:09,022
Taught directly by the Pervert
Sennin It's the Summon-No-Jutsu!!

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,703
Not as I imagined...

6
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,836
Don't you ever sleep?

7
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,321
What do you want?

8
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:50,353
I thought I'd better take care of you here.

9
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,967
So I can possibly go against Sasuke-kun,

10
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,858
since I'm the odd one out in the first round.

11
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:03,016
I know your sand attacks...

12
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:07,820
I wonder if it's faster than my sound.

13
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,487
During the full moon...

14
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,117
During the night of the full moon,

15
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,769
I can feel the blood of "that" move.

16
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,520
What...?!

17
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,047
What are you?!

18
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,795
That's incredible.

19
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,131
Is that the real him?

20
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:27,590
But, is it ok?

21
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:28,591
He's from the Sound...

22
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,616
It's alright.

23
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,353
We were done with him a long time ago.

24
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,053
I thought he was a tool to...

25
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,207
test that Sasuke kid's ability.

26
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,348
Why is he meeting with the Sand?

27
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,174
No...

28
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,372
That isn't necessary anymore.

29
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:50,642
In fact...

30
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:54,110
I was already ordered to abduct Sasuke-kun.

31
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:54,654
But...

32
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,423
I failed to do it.

33
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,229
What?

34
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:58,812
Yes.

35
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,825
...somebody like you.

36
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:04,291
Do you want to try that somebody?

37
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:08,012
I see that you're a spoiled brat.

38
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,326
You shouldn't fuck around with adults.

39
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:14,995
Don't talk so big.

40
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:18,154
I've got an advantage in this situation.

41
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:29,793
They already know that I'm the spy of the Sound.

42
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:31,398
Then...

43
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,503
if they find out you're meeting with me secretly.

44
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,583
Everything, including the plan

45
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,917
to crush Konoha, will be in vain.

46
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,742
I heard that you're Orochimaru's right hand, but...

47
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:52,230
you're a fool to come to see me after you got caught.

48
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:54,904
Well, not really.

49
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:58,827
To be exact, it's not that they caught me.

50
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:01,264
It's me who revealed myself to them.

51
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,364
I wanted to know how much Konoha would react to that.

52
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:11,452
It is not too late to abduct Sasuke after seeing that.

53
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,805
If you guys fail, then we'll back out soon.

54
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:20,735
This is the plan that the Sound brought to us after all.

55
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,012
The Sand won't appear at the front until the last minute.

56
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,992
That's Kazekage's wishes.

57
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:30,900
What!

58
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,167
That's fine.

59
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:36,910
This is the execution strategy of the Sound.

60
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:44,820
And, please let them know about this plan, too.

61
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:49,076
Yes, I know that.

62
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:53,392
Then, I'm leaving now.

63
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:59,211
Our ally, the Sand is already connected to the Sound.

64
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,099
I need to tell this to Hokage-sama quickly.

65
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:02,528
Oh, and...

66
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:07,172
I'll take care of cleaning up.

67
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,546
No, I'll do it.

68
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:13,456
I should do a little work for our friends...

69
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:17,268
as the Sand are guests in the Wind country.

70
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:21,570
Besides there is only one rat.

71
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,567
It's easy.

72
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:42,319
Oh, It's Mr. Examiner.

73
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:48,407
What are you doing at a place like this alone?

74
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,451
There's no other choice but fighting you.

75
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,915
Konoha-ryu Mikazuki-no-Mai (Konoha
style Crescent Dance)

76
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:42,142
I can't pull it out.

77
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,629
This technique is the
Konoha-ryu Mikazuki-no-Mai?

78
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,054
It's impressive to be able to use it at that young age...

79
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,920
I can tell that this village has good ones, as I thought.

80
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:56,879
That was a great sword move.

81
00:08:57,426 --> 00:09:02,134
But the truth is that the actual blade can be stopped.

82
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:08,403
However, no one can stop the blade of the Wind.

83
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,639
That's good. So good!

84
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:35,946
Hey.

85
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,139
This is paradise.

86
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,509
I said hey!

87
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,701
Won't you turn around and look at me already?

88
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:05,220
If you train me, I'll do you a lot of services.

89
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,868

P-L-E-A-S-E

90
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:12,941
Oh, you're finally out. I've been waiting for you.

91
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,188
Are you making fun of me?

92
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,554
You're doing the same to me, too.

93
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:29,239
Ah, I'm hungry.

94
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,282
Let's go back to hotel now.

95
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,519
Damnit.

96
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:42,174
Alright. I'll teach you the technique...

97
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,460
Do you really have the intention to do that?

98
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:53,253
Do you remember the chat about
two types of chakra from yesterday?

99
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,826
Our chat yesterday?

100
00:10:56,357 --> 00:11:00,997
You were saying something like blue chakra and red chakra.

101
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,876
Yeah. And what about it?

102
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,312
You said you felt the red chakra
when a great power came out from you.

103
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:11,416
Yeah. I think it was something like that.

104
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:15,308
Then, channel that red chakra right now.

105
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,732
Ah... if you say so... Well, I'll give it a try.

106
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,013
How's it?

107
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:39,030
Nope. This isn't it. This is the regular chakra.

108
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:43,106
Man! You've got no talent.

109
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:50,738
Don't talk big! Besides I don't even
know what those two types of chakra are!

110
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,383
Shut up and continue.

111
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,264
"I don't even know", eh?

112
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:11,517
He doesn't realize yet that the red chakra is Kyubi's chakra.

113
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:22,534
Well, by summarizing what he says, being
at risk of his life or emotional rage...

114
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,785
...is the key to bring out the Kyubi's chakra.

115
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,997
Ah. No. No. I can only channel the usual chakra.

116
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:39,507
Hey, Ero Sennin. What's the relationship between
this red chakra and the technique you will teach me?

117
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,849
Listen, kid.

118
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,480
Your regular chakra isn't sufficient
at all for the technique I'll teach you.

119
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:59,080
That's why you need to be able to bring out and use the other chakra,
the huge one that is lying unused inside of you,  whenever you need.

120
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:05,053
But why do you know I have such chakra?

121
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:08,782
Oh, thank you for asking!

122
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:13,456
Beause... I'm a Sennin.

123
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:17,507
You're not answering my question!

124
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:23,000
Anyways, the special chakra that only
you have will be your greatest weapon.

125
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,052
My greatest weapon?

126
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:29,895
If you don't use it, you're wasting the treasure.

127
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:33,431
There's no need to do the same
training that everybody else does.

128
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,653
Everybody has things that they're good at and bad at.

129
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:40,231
You have your own style.

130
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:46,814
Trainings up till now were to hold, or
to keep releasing chakra at a fixed level.

131
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:52,912
In other words, it was a training for using chakra
with control so that you won't get tired out.

132
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:57,421
But you should learn the power rather than
control because you have great stamina.

133
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,923
With two types of chakra, you won't get easily tired
out... you should release as much chakra as possible,

134
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:12,446
and should train to be able to maximize
the amount of chakra that can be used.

135
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,240
There are techniques and skills
that can be learned only with it.

136
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:21,067
For example, what?

137
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,992
For example, the technique I'm going to teach you from now...

138
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,167

Kuchiyose-no-jutsu. (Summon-no-jutsu)

139
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,258
Kuchiyose?

140
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,582
That's right.

141
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:41,140
By making a contract with different
animals, with your blood beforehand,

142
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:45,522
you can bring them out anytime, and any place you
want with ninjutsu. It's a space-time ninjutsu.

143
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,161
Wow. That sounds great!

144
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,866
Teach me! Teach me now!

145
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:55,766
Before that, first...

146
00:14:55,767 --> 00:15:00,669
You need to use up all your regular chakra.

147
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,316
Alright.

148
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:05,891
Leave it to me.

149
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,484
Oh, he can use Kage-bunshin.

150
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:20,407
I have a good idea to quickly use up all the regular chakra.

151
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:39,129
You've got a good number of replications.

152
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:44,782
Hey! We're gonna do the battle-royal.

153
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,607
The last one to survive is the strongest me.

154
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:51,656
We'll decide the me of me.

155
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:58,161
I see. That's a good idea from someone so stupid.

156
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,637
Alright. let's do it.

157
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:29,618
Well, this is an unromantic scene to watch.

158
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:01,222
Finally, the end is near.

159
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,255
Great.

160
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:43,766
I am the strongest me, as expected.

161
00:17:57,346 --> 00:18:00,811
I see that you've finally used up most of your chakra.

162
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,136
I will finally teach you the technique now.

163
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:08,821
I've been waiting for this.

164
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:14,195
First, I'll  show you. Look carefully.

165
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,021

Kuchiyose-no-jutsu!

166
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,314
Cool!

167
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,493
Open that scroll.

168
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:50,549
That is the contract with toads for summoning, that
was handed down to me from generation to generation.

169
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:57,482
Write your name with your blood, and put blood finger prints
of all your fingers of one of your hands, underneath it.

170
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:04,773
Then, channel the chakra to where you want to summon,
and put down the hand you made the contract with.

171
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:09,482
In hand seal's it's boar, dog, hen, monkey, sheep.

172
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:20,489
U... Zu... Ma... Ki... Na... Ru.. To

173
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,726
Alright. It's done.

174
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:39,941
Your current condition makes the red chakra come out easier.

175
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,745
