Defeated who sara'?

27

Uzumaki Naruto

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,730
I was tired to wait for.

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,310
E' the moment to show my techniques!

31
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,270
You are zitto!

32
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,340
Against of you I have the Victoria insured.

33
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,840
Just Akamaru?

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,750
You are dreamming!

35
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,450
You will not never strike to me!

36
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,960
What!

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,610
Then it leaves the cucciolo outside…

38
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,330
… that otherwise intralcerà to us.

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,590
Idiot! Akamaru fights with me.

40
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,450
But it is valid?

41
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,140
Sure, animals and bugs are thought crews.

42
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,290
You would have to know it.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,790
It makes nothing!

44
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,890
E' the just advantage of which you have need.

45
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,570
You make the hard one, eh?

46
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,510
Well…

47
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,950
Akamaru, waits for to me here.

48
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,490
I manage alone.

49
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,490
Naruto! You do not have to lose with that braggart!

50
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,490
There are finally.

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,150
Naruto, eh?

52
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,040
Me dispiace, but it  cannot  strike Kiba.

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,540
… Kakashi.

54
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,670
Naruto-kun…

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,600
… I would want to make the tifo for you…

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,420
… but they are in the group of Kiba-kun…

57
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,470
… and Kiba could be angered,  but…

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,810
Naruto-kun…

59
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,320
Kiba-kun has been fortunate.

60
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,700
I do not know how much is improved
after to have become genin…

61
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,310
Today ripassiamo the Henge Not Jutsu…

62
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,280
… you will transform yourselves in Hokage-Sama.

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,490
It was not a granche '…

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,910
Henge!! (Transformation)

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,090
What happens…

66
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,240
… I was making a beautiful one sonnellino.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,030
That one was only one joke.

68
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,890
I have made on purpose.

69
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,870
Not to take to me in turn, Naruto.

70
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,340
This is your third year of academy!

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,820
Cabbage…

72
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,500
… but who is that one?

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,470
We have been fortunate to have changed class.

74
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,120
It has made one joke earning
the attention of all.

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Circles of being amusing, eh?

76
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
It tries again to us, fool!

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,770
Henge!

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,990
And this would be…

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,540
Six in academy from three years…

80
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,910
… and you do not know to use the Henge decent?

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,500
Not to say cos ì…

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,590
… why a day  I will be  Hokage!

83
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
Six stupid or what?

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,250
Tu Hokage?

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,500
I will strike  to you  with a single blow.

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,420
Ah is?

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,280
Then anch' I  will make  the same one.

88
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,020
I have said not to make the hard one to you!

89
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,940
Well…

90
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,580
… you can begin.

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,000
Gijyuu Ninpou, Shikyaku not Jutsu!
(WILD MAGICAL ART:
Technique of four legs)

92
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,650
Via!

93
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,030
The fastest E'!

94
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,220
Examiner, will not wake up itself for a beautiful one po '.

95
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,690
As I thought.

96
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,830
It was impossible that Naruto struck Kiba.

97
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,940
Naruto-Kun, than figuraccia.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,500
Approval?

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,210
I did not make it cos ì  insufficient.

100
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,160
Naruto-kun!

101
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,280
…

102
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,660
I will exceed  in ability all the Hokage…

103
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,940
… cos ì  all the inhabitants of the village
they will recognize my value!

104
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,260
I had not never believed, to its words…

105
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,670
Cos ì  this is a Jonin?

106
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,940
A true one ninja.

107
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,490
I must scappare.

108
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,220
Otherwise…

109
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,800
… I…

110
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,290
… I  will come  sure killed!

111
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,330
You are well…

112
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,270
… fifone?

113
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,230
It becomes more strongly than me.

114
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,410
Damned!!!

115
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,700
Why… perchè you have made it?

116
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,610
The idiot and codardo that I have of forehead…

117
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,950
…  he cannot  be…

118
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,130
… the Sasuke that I know!

119
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,030
Not to take to us in turn!

120
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,270
What!

121
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,220
But  I mistook myself.

122
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,500
Hey…

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,810
You are well…

124
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,510

125
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,610
I not me rimangio the words.

126
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,700
This is my creed ninja!

127
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Naruto…

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,950
… dillo to all!

129
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,560
You make…

130
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,330
You make badly…

131
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,250
… to underrate me!

132
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
It has acquired emergency.

133
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,800
Naruto-kun.>.

134
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,910
Force, Naruto!

135
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,240
Stupid!

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,020
You stop it to make the arrogant one!

137
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,220
I will strike  to you  easy!

138
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,500
I wanted to only see your abilities.

139
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,610
Test pure to use the cur or
what you want!

140
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,770
You of it you will repent!

141
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,450
We go Akamaru!

142
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,340
Smoke-producing bombs?

143
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,600
It pecks this to you!

144
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,130
I must exit from the smoke…

145
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,340
… or it will strike to me.

146
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,500
I do not succeed to see nothing.

147
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,150
Six falled to us.

148
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,480
What?

149
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,250
Eternal damnation cos ì  is not looked at null.

150
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,210
Evvai! Ce you have made it!

151
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,020
Beautiful job, Akama…

152
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,050
Akamaru… why?

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Why?

154
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,660
Six falled to us.

155
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,420
Transformed you…!

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,550
Damned Ouch……

157
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,760

158
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,720
You have the sapore of a dog!

159
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,370
Akamaru, dov' and '?

160
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,670
E' here!

161
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,000
Akamaru!

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,260
Eternal damnation!

163
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,820
Incredible E' Naruto!

164
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,770
It is fighting at par with Kiba.

165
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,930
Indeed, it seems quite more fort.

166
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,120
Incredible E' that Naruto
it has used the Henge not Jutsu…

167
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,210
… with the Kage Bunshin Not Jutsu.

168
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,960
It has had an optimal tempismo
in I use of the techniques.

169
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,090
E' better than how much you thought.

170
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,730
Truly interesting this Naruto…

171
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,450
… it is making to drive crazy the adversary.

172
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,910
Naruto-kun…!

173
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,390
Optimal movement, Naruto!

174
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,080
I admit that six improved…

175
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,040
… but you do not have hopes.

176
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,660
Now  I will make  seriously.

177
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,520
Ah s ì?

178
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,780
Then anch' I!

179
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,070
E' still improved more during this examination.

180
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,090
That beautiful surprise!

181
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,470
That one is indeed Naruto,
the worse one of the academy?

182
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,380
It does not seem the Naruto that we know.

183
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,210
Already.

184
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,860
As it has made Kakashi
in order to make to improve it a lot?

185
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,650
but…

186
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,950
… the force of Kiba and Akamaru

You are in order to give back my Akamaru to me!

189
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,780

190
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,690
You have given what to it?

191
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,510
Why its hair is red.

192
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,420
Ecco perche' calls Akamaru

193
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,130
One pill?

194
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,870

Jyuujin Bunshin!
(wild Multiplication)

199
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,330
It has a terrifying expression.

200
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,140
This is dopping!

201
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,110
But it is valid?

202
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,810
… the pills have considered one instrument

203
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,170
From always the reason!

204
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,640

205
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,730

* gunryo gandayo
Tonic from war

207
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,810
gunryo gandayo?

208
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:41,060
E' a secret medicine that allows
to the guerriero to fight for
three days and three nights without having to sleep.

209
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,360
Proteico and highly easy digeribile E'.

210
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,360
At the same time it has an effect
stimulating and reassuring.

211
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,870
The chakra of Kiba and Akamaru
temporary it is doubled

212
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,900
Hour  I will close  the encounter.

213
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,060
Via!

214
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,620
Technique of…

215
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,510
… Gatsuuga!

216
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,780
Naruto!

217
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,710
Naruto is in danger.

218
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,440
The chakra of Kiba it encircles its body…

219
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,560
… ideal for he that it fights like one beast.

220
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,810
Those pills…

221
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,670
… they are ideal for he.

222
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,850
Naruto-kun…

223
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,410
Cabbage!

224
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,160
Nothing to make.

225
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,330
Even if I concentrate all the chakra in the feet,
I only succeed in schivare its attacks.

226
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,790
At this rate it will have the better one.

227
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,780
Uncovered E'.

228
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,810
You take this!!

229
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,790
You they are much advanced one.

230
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,620
I must…

231
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,260
… to become the next Hokage…

232
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,540
… I cannot lose here.

233
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,310
You? Hokage?

234
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,560
But if six more weak person than me?

235
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,650
I  will become…

236
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,240
… Hokage for you!!

237
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,050
Within of you you know very well
that you will not never become Hokage.

238
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,260
Therefore  you stop it to repeat it.

239
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,820
Like six cruel one, Kiba-kun.

240
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,750
Naruto-kun…

241
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,030
… she is not cos ì  weak person.

242
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,000
A day…

243
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,520
… I will receive  the title it of Hokage!

244
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,640
You will see!

245
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,810
With the exception of me, Naruto always has
believed in the own forces.

246
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,480
I have always admired for this…

247
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,660
… inasmuch as I understand how much is difficult…

248
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,270
… its training.

249
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,880
But  nobody has never tried to understand it…

250
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,480
… and to see the true Naruto-kun.

251
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,130
E' he that child.

252
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,010
E' be the only one to being bocciato.

253
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,240
It was a bond to null.

254
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,490
It would have been a disaster…

255
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,450
… if it had become ninja.

256
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,630
Why it is alone.>.

257
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,650
Zitta! Sai that it is forbidden to speak of.

258
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,730
No test to recognize the true Naruto-kun

259
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,120
Bushin not jutsu!

260
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,260
But  now…

261
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,550
… all are watching it.

262
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,050
It raises To You, Naruto!

263
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,300
All will recognize its value.

264
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,510
If you want to compete with me for the title it of Hokage…

265
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,490
… I will have  to defeat to you.

266
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,270

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:18,440
