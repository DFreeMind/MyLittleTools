1
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:21,622
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:26,431
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:29,063
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:31,664
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:36,270
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:46,187
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:55,558
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:06,340
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:15,817
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:20,947
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,796
- <i>Where...</i>
- <i>Where...</i>

12
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,900
- <i>Where...am I?</i>
- <i>Where...am I?</i>

13
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,392
<i>Remembrance. The Lost Page</i>

14
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:11,356
All right! I'm up for it today again,
believe it!

15
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:18,835
However... There haven't been
any flashy missions around here lately.

16
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,010
C'mon! It's unbelievable, right?!

17
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:27,543
Yeah well...

18
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:30,817
Lately, I'm dead tired from doing
nothing but training.

19
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:32,445
Sakura!

20
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:33,551
Naruto!

21
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:34,954
There's someone who got
too much time on his hands!

22
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,156
What's that?! Speak for yourself.

23
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,388
No matter how I look at it,
you are just helping the shop.

24
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,260
What happened to Shikamaru
and Choji?

25
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,394
On a mission with Asuma Sensei!

26
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:47,228
Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!

27
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:52,240
While Ino was down with a cold,
everyone went on urgent missions.

28
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,309
And now I'm completely recovered!

29
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,943
What am I going to do with
all my fighting spirit?

30
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,509
Why don't you use that fighting spirit
in some training?

31
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:01,812
That's what you think!

32
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,148
In my family, if you don't have
a training partner,

33
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:07,850
then they make up some reason
for you to help out with the shop!

34
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,526
They must know that if you're alone
you'll skip training, eh?

35
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:14,788
H Hey! Don't say something that
could hurt a person's reputation!

36
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,100
I do it properly by myself.

37
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,432
Naruto...

38
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:22,797
Stop it, Shino! Don't surprise me!

39
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,004
Naruto Uzumaki... Yamanaka Ino...

40
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,341
The Hokage is asking
for both of you.

41
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,571
What? Me too?

42
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,049
By the way, I've also been ordered to go,
along with you guys.

43
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:35,877
- Huh?
- Huh?

44
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,851
Ino... me and Shino?

45
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:38,611
Huh?

46
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,856
Demon of Ocean causing disturbance?

47
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,629
Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.

48
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:51,397
It seems to be the cause of the disturbance
happening in the remote Land of Sea...

49
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,801
What's wrong...?

50
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,140
You'll go for me, won't you?

51
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:02,802
Of course.

52
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:06,377
Shizune...

53
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,644
Y Yes!

54
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,783
Explain...

55
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,316
Y Yes!

56
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,045
As you can see,

57
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,558
the Land of Sea is made up of
a group of islands of various sizes.

58
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,891
Recently in that area, their only means
of transportation, ships,

59
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:23,160
are being attacked and robbed
of money and valuables.

60
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,662
The people on the boat who
were victimized

61
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,830
unanimously claim that the damage
was done by the "Demon of the Ocean."

62
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,704
And exterminating this Demon
of the Ocean is the mission?

63
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:38,670
Well... more or less, yes.
But there's more.

64
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,579
The Land of Sea does not have
a hidden village of its own,

65
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,380
so they're prepared for contingencies

66
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:46,013
through military cooperation with
the neighboring country, the Land of Water,

67
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,023
and have been paying them
a retainer every month...

68
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:51,385
However, the other day,
one of their ships that collects funds

69
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,520
was attacked by
the Demon of the Ocean as well...

70
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:57,722
I see. To preserve their relationship
with Land of Water,

71
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,929
Land of Sea will do anything
to protect the next ship.

72
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:05,340
Yes... This mission is to guard
the ships collecting funds

73
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,534
and destroy the Demon of the Ocean...

74
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:10,609
I've got a few people to work under you,
so I'm counting on you.

75
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:11,475
Work under me...?

76
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,212
Enter!

77
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:16,976
Huh?

78
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,618
The Chunin Exam's...

79
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,892
Th That scary proctor!

80
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:30,732
Oh, you're bringing back memories!

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,735
A Anko Mitarashi Sensei?

82
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,235
Why are you here?

83
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,329
- Everyone!
- Yes!

84
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,406
I'm pronouncing your mission!

85
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,506
Shino Aburame!
Ino Yamanaka!

86
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,839
Naruto Uzumaki!

87
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:47,174
The three of you will work under Anko
and accompany her on a mission!

88
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,180
What?! These members?

89
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:51,618
The team is pretty disjointed, isn't it?!

90
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:53,011
No use talking about it!

91
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,387
Listen... I've thought through
the matter and

92
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,427
I believe that this combination is

93
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:01,157
the most qualified for this mission...

94
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:06,001
All of you display your own capabilities
to the full extent and execute this mission!

95
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,268
- Yes!
- Yes!

96
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:12,865
<i>She just gathered the available Genin...</i>
<i>Really, she is such a...</i>

97
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:17,812
Still, something doesn't feel quite right...

98
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,273
Yeah, yeah, no complaints about
a mission that's settled!

99
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,581
Ouuch... I got it!

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,281
Okay, we'll depart right away!

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,217
Everyone prepare and assemble
at the front gate!

102
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,121
-Roger!
-Roger!

103
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:32,121
Oh, ouch!

104
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:35,426
Anko...

105
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,195
Be careful...

106
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:46,599
Yes...

107
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,913
Characteristics of
the Demon of the Ocean...

108
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:01,681
It's like a fish, like a person...
What is this?!

109
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:05,555
Huh, someone's eyes are playing tricks.
Something like that can't exist!

110
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:09,230
Not true, it's possible that Ex Ninja
become pirates

111
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,961
and use Transformation and Genjutsu.

112
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:16,968
Well, whatever, if we don't gather
information, there will be no solution.

113
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,836
Right...

114
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,166
Mother Island is the biggest island
at the center of Land of Sea...

115
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,738
We'll go to a nearby fishing port
and cross over by boat!

116
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,341
- I understand!
- I understand!

117
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:29,382
Yeah! Let's depart for the Land of Sea!

118
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,845
<i>This guy is always hyper...</i>

119
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:35,556
<i>I'm anxious about what's going to happen.</i>

120
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,294
Here you are...

121
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,665
Um... Lady Tsunade...

122
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:48,698
Hmm?

123
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:51,973
It's about... Anko Mitarashi just now...

124
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,708
Did, uh...
Did something happen in the past?

125
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,140
Sort of...

126
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:12,621
Oh? This is...

127
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,226
Her record of missions from about
the age of ten is pretty sporadic.

128
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,694
Because Anko was under Orochimaru...

129
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,404
So the parts that are blacked out

130
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,374
are combined
with Orochimaru's movements...

131
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:27,808
and in the confidential file?

132
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,603
Part of them are...

133
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,271
Huh?

134
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,811
There are some parts
that aren't recorded...

135
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,109
That's the truth.

136
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:39,447
No record?! Even though
Anko herself was in the village?

137
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,289
That Orochimaru...

138
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:47,492
It seems he really didn't
want to be traced...

139
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,364
When he left the village...

140
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,032
He erased part of Anko's memories.

141
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,737
The wind is salty...

142
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,638
Coming this far, we can already
see over the Land of Sea.

143
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:04,004
Then, that must be the Mother Island?

144
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,713
<i>What? What is this feeling?</i>

145
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,187
Everyone... Sorry but...

146
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,094
Go ahead and take care
of the arrangements for the boat.

147
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,823
What? But, what would you do, Sensei?

148
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:01,502
I'll take care of some business
and join you... See you!

149
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,163
Oh! Sensei?!

150
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,599
C'mon, it can't be helped...

151
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,534
What are you doing, Shino?

152
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,009
We'll leave you behind!

153
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,139
Yeah...

154
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,545
<i>The Curse Mark aches.</i>

155
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,588
<i>This presence... No question about it.</i>

156
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:23,852
<i>This way?</i>

157
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,016
<i>I can say their names</i>
<i>without a problem!</i>

158
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,253
<i>Um... That's Mother Island...</i>

159
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,689
<i>These are Taro Island and Jiro island.</i>

160
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,424
<i>And... That there's Demon Island!</i>

161
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,298
<i>Seems you prepared before you came...</i>

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,336
<i>I want to become a wiser, stronger</i>
<i>Shinobi like you, Master Orochimaru...</i>

163
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:11,032
<i>Oh... ?

164
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:22,847
Here.

165
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,751
Sorry, but I can't give you anything
more than this.

166
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,355
What's up... Ino?

167
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,723
Hey, mister!

168
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,229
Aren't you bringing prices down
way too much?

169
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,199
That's high quality fish, isn't it?

170
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,663
Oh dear...

171
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,665
I'm not price cutting...

172
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,536
See...

173
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:46,370
Because of that
"Demon of the Ocean" uproar,

174
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:49,343
customers are completely staying away...

175
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,172
This is the market price around here.

176
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:56,444
Really? That fish is rarely...
Oh!

177
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,888
What's with her appearance?
Is she injured or something?

178
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,316
No... That girl, she has her reasons.

179
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:05,924
Well...

180
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:09,123
She's a female diver from a small town
on the cape of Mother Island...

181
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:09,892
What?!

182
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:14,765
Why would a woman diver on
Mother Island transfer islands on purpose?

183
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:18,972
That's because, the island people
didn't want to do business with her...

184
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,872
That girl...

185
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,072
In the past, she was spirited away...

186
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:25,438
Spirited away...?

187
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:28,742
A person suddenly disappears...
is that it?

188
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,181
That's right!

189
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,375
In the past,

190
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:34,287
a lot of island people disappeared
from being spirited away.

191
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,622
The story is that out of all those people

192
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,923
that girl was the only one
who suddenly returned one day.

193
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:40,754
Hey, hey!

194
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,793
It's a little village...

195
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,033
So everyone felt creepy.

196
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,801
They say that now, she lives alone
outside of the village...

197
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:58,072
I see... I feel sorry for her.

198
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:02,141
With her appearance...
And then you hear things, I too...

199
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:04,753
feel a little bit creepy...

200
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:07,614
That's true.

201
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,584
Hey, where's Naruto?

202
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,590
I don't know...

203
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:42,890
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

204
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:44,315
Oh no!

205
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,755
Hey, are you okay?

206
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:47,721
Yes...

207
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:54,128
You're uh... You're from a place called
Mother Island, aren't you?

208
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,129
Hm?

209
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:57,430
Uh... Nothing...

210
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:01,475
<i>Ninja...</i>

211
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:03,807
Oh, I'll help!

212
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:04,640
That's okay...

213
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,346
Huh? H-Hey... Wait.

214
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,611
What the...?

215
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:17,889
It's too bad but, the last boat from
the port has already left.

216
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,627
But the sun hasn't even set yet...

217
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:24,999
Around here, there's nobody who
will take you across in the early evening...

218
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,936
Sorry, but come back tomorrow.

219
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,529
No way...

220
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,699
Well, is there a way to get to
Mother Island besides the ferry?

221
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:36,509
Mmm, I can't really advise it, but...

222
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,242
If it's necessary,
I'll let you borrow my little boat.

223
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,982
Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!

224
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,488
C'mon! Where were you?!

225
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,958
Sorry, sorry...

226
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,360
You should at least say something
before you disappear.

227
00:15:55,698 --> 00:16:00,692
You and Sensei are exactly alike,
suddenly going someplace.

228
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:05,304
Feels like there'll be
a bumpy road ahead.

229
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:07,069
What?! That's rude.

230
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,543
Placing me in the same category together
with that unreasonable sensei...!

231
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:11,711
Who's what?

232
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,176
S Sorry.

233
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,479
<i>This sensei... is dangerous, after all...</i>

234
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,245
Good work procuring the boat!

235
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:21,387
S Sensei... Where in the world
have you been all this time?

236
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,022
Oh, something like
gathering information...

237
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,525
Well, let's go!

238
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,264
The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here...

239
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,764
Land of Sea must have
pleaded with them

240
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:35,133
to investigate on
the " Demon of the Ocean.

241
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:38,372
Well then, we should give them
the best welcome.

242
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,007
It's getting dark...

243
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,571
We're almost to Mother Island.

244
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,481
All right, all right!

245
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,948
Full speed advance to Mother Island!

246
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,644
Although the sun has already set...

247
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:55,384
Where does all your hyper energy
come from?!

248
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:59,254
Times like this,
your state of mind is important!

249
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,761
Sakura sure has her share of trouble...
I feel sorry for her.

250
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,437
What the...!
I ran up against a rock or something!

251
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:12,768
Hang in there, Naruto!

252
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,105
Hey, all of you look forward, front!

253
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:17,476
Dodge it, quick!

254
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,837
You say that, but...

255
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,717
It's no good, the oar won't move!

256
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:22,445
I'll help!

257
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,016
You...!

258
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,587
Striking Shadow Snake!

259
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,323
Naruto! Leave it!

260
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,089
I understand!

261
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,293
To show themself so soon...

262
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,969
That was close...

263
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:51,642
The two of you be careful!
He's aiming at us from underwater!

264
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,514
Dammit!

265
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,414
<i>Demon of the Ocean or whatever,</i>

266
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,952
<i>an underwater creature for</i>
<i>an underwater battle!</i>

267
00:17:58,387 --> 00:17:59,479
Summoning Jutsu!

268
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:01,984
<i>I'm counting on you... Chief Toad!</i>

269
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,490
What?!

270
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:10,097
Hey! Naruto!
What kind of place did you call me to?!

271
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,158
Why did you come out!
You stupid frog!

272
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:14,494
Oh! Hey, wait!

273
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,764
Summoning Jutsu.

274
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,804
<i>Please come out, Chief Toad!</i>

275
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:21,205
Hey, good evening!

276
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:24,474
It can't be!
I have been calling for Chief Toad!

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,274
Stupid! If you summoned
the old man to a place like this,

278
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,749
terrible things would happen.

279
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:29,875
Huh? Why?

280
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:33,749
We're freshwater creatures!
We don't go with saltwater!

281
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,449
I don't like salty things either.

282
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,088
You're no help at all!

283
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,764
Shino! Take care of Ino...

284
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:44,727
Okay!

285
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,529
All right!

286
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:50,531
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!

287
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:03,345
<i>Water Clone?!</i>

288
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,151
You let your guard down!

289
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:07,814
You did too!

290
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:08,683
Take that!

291
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,892
<i>There was one more?!</i>

292
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,499
<i>What the... ? My body strength is...!</i>

293
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,872
How is it?
My improved skill of Chakra Suction?

294
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,336
<i>What's happening?!</i>

295
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:35,145
<i>Where did he go? Damn it!</i>

296
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,715
<i>My visibility is too bad...</i>

297
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:45,426
Hey, pull yourself together, Naruto!

298
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:50,023
Big Brother, it itches.

299
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,993
Ah, I'm at my limit, too...

300
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,462
B-Big Brother!

301
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,371
This is not so good.

302
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:03,706
Naruto!

303
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,575
What happened?

304
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:10,815
You two are?!

305
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:15,424
I'll discharge all the Chakra
I absorbed at once...

306
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:18,553
<i>Water Style. Furious Current Jutsu!</i>

307
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,501
Shoot! I can't approach them
so easily with this.

308
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,066
<i>Naruto...</i>

309
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:36,042
I can't stand this!

310
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,267
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

311
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:38,069
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

312
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,674
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

313
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:43,677
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

314
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:47,739
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

315
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,318
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

316
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,577
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

317
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:55,453
<i>The images.</i>

318
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:02,463
<i>It probably will not end</i>

319
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,859
<i>It probably will not end</i>

320
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:13,709
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

321
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,735
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

322
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:19,779
<i>Running freely</i>

323
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:23,410
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

324
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,511
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

325
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:29,490
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

326
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:36,095
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

327
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:39,366
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

328
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:42,871
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

329
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:52,503
To think the departure of
the collection ship

330
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:53,946
would be moved up
at the time like this.

331
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,005
It can't be helped.

332
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:57,382
We've got to find Naruto somehow
by tomorrow morning.

333
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:59,785
I hope we pick up some information about
the Demon of the Ocean along the way.

334
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:02,255
The search range is quite expansive, huh?

335
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:03,188
It'd be best to split up.

336
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,319
Then I'll go from the south,
you guys take the north.

337
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:07,393
-Roger!
-Roger!

338
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:08,825
Think about what happened yesterday.

339
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:11,662
Each of you, tackle this with care. Scatter!

340
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:14,998
Next time: "The Closed Door"
