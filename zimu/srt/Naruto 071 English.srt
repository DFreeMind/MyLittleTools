2
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:43,694
Temari... How close is it?

3
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,902
Very close. He is right there.

4
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,257
Shit. What should we do?

5
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:55,299
Leave it to me.

6
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,981
They do some fine work.

7
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,216
What is that sound?

8
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:41,476
An Explosion. It's probably a trap made for Sasuke.

9
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:44,955
I wonder if Sasuke-kun is all right.

10
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:50,408
There's no need to worry. He won't get knocked out so easily.

11
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,886
It'd be fine if that were the truth.

12
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:05,717
Well then... shall we get things started now?

13
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:11,714
but before that, I need you two to return to your true forms.

14
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:16,331
Be prepared, Sarutobi-Sensei.

15
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:23,173
Nothing at the same level even now and then!
A fight at the level of Hokage

16
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:10,692
The life is coming back to their faces quickly. What is that Jutsu?

17
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,853
It's Edo Tensei....

18
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:18,097
It's a forbidden Kuchiyose (Summoning) to
bring back the dead to this world again.

19
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:24,510
Normally, Kuchiyose uses the Jutsusha's
(Jutsu performer) blood as its cost.

20
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:31,586
But I heard that this jutsu, in order
to summon and to keep the soul of dead

21
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:37,120
in this world, you must sacrifice a living
person's body as a container for the soul.

22
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:41,791
Then, those two bodies are ones from a sacrifice?

23
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:52,173
Yeah, and probably the sacrificed bodies are covered
by dust from the remains of the summoned souls.

24
00:04:52,174 --> 00:05:01,588
And the label put into their head kills the personality
of the summoned souls and makes them just killing dolls.

25
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,727
All done.

26
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,858
You two are just as I remembered...

27
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:19,639
Do you know the sense of fulfillment and joy from
hurting a person whom you once called a teacher?

28
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:28,030
I've prepared this stage for you to feel the joy. So, please enjoy it.

29
00:05:52,752 --> 00:06:01,601
Hokage-sama, even if their body and faces are
same, they are not the true First and Second!

30
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:04,650
I know that!

31
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,924
I'm coming!

32
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,165
Katon Karyu Endan 
(Fire Element Stream of Fire Bullets)

33
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:53,058
Suiton Suijin Heki 
(Water Element Water Wall)

34
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:06,102
You've got to be kidding me!
Creating that much water in place with no water!

35
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:08,459
Unbelievable!

36
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:18,782
That's a former Hokage for sure.

37
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,436
Suiton Suishoha
(Water Element Water Wave)

38
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,095
Doton Doryu Heki
(Earth Element Mud Wall)

39
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,475
I see you still have your Herculean type of strength.

40
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:59,888
It sure is tough to fight against these two.

41
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:45,114
This is bad... that is the secret Jutsu that only the First knows.

42
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,689
Mokuton Hijutsu
(Wood Element Secret jutsu)

43
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,125
Jukai Koutan
(Birth of the Woods)

44
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:41,297
Chakara is a resource of life.

45
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:50,227
Amazing! That is the legendary Mokuton Ninjutsu of the
First, who ruled during the wars and founded Konoha.

46
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:59,344
You finally got caught, Sensei.

47
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,883
All right, everybody is here.

48
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:18,665
Everybody keep it moving.

49
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,598
Be calm and don't rush.

50
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:31,831
Konohamaru-chan, what's wrong? Does your stomach hurt?

51
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,635
It's not that.

52
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:57,326
Ninpo Kuchiyose. Come out, Enko Enma (Monkey King, Enma)!

53
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:17,678
A troublesome one came out...

54
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:24,681
Old monkey, Enma.

55
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:36,739
Orochimaru... It's just as I guessed.

56
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:42,584
You're pathetic, Sarutobi. This is because you didn't kill him then.

57
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:44,965
Well, I'll do it from now.

58
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,777
It's too late.

59
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:54,820
Please, Enma. Do the Kongo-Nyoi (Diamond Strength Stick).

60
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,237
Finish him. Don't let him Henge (Transform).

61
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,513
All right, I got it.

62
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,396
Henge!

63
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,967
Good.

64
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,276
Amazing. What a level of Ninjutsu war...

65
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:37,677
This is the level of Hokage.

66
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:43,962
That's ok. This is just getting fun.

67
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,648
It's the Kusanagi-no-tsurugi.

68
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,158
Let's go, Enma.

69
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,004
Even with the body of Kongo (diamond hard body), 
that Kusanagi-no-tsurugi still hurts.

70
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,960
I got you.

71
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,297
How foolish... attacking straight on without using Kage-bunshin.

72
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:31,073
No, it isn't true. It's not that he doesn't use, it's he can't use.

73
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:35,163
Unlike before, the amount of chakra the Third has now is lower.

74
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:41,480
Using Kage-bunshin that equally distributes the
remaining chakra is like throwing away his chakra.

75
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,802
As I expected, he's gotten too old...

76
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,931
Are you all right, Sensei?

77
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,947
Be strong.

78
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:06,027
You once were called a Professor who knew
and used all the Jutsu that existed in Konoha.

79
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,758
Don't disappoint me so much.

80
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:18,998
Hokage-sama, stand up and please save the village of Konoha!

81
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:27,033
Fools... it's too late.

82
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:41,806
Sarutobi, what's up? This isn't like you.

83
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:47,578
He isn't doing it. What are you hesitating for?

84
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,298
End it this time.

85
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:08,523
You Fool!

86
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:24,059
Orochimaru, this is the end. I'll crush your neck.

87
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:42,249
That won't do any good unless I do something to
the soul itself since its binded by the Edo-Tensei.

88
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:49,321
Then, I have no choice but to use the Fourth's Jutsu.

89
00:18:53,514 --> 00:19:00,686
Please forgive me, the First, the Second. I'll use that Jutsu.

90
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:08,120
Sensei, you seem to be breathing harder now.

91
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:14,685
You've become old. I've never seen you having
difficulty breathing (or suffering) this much before.

92
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,627
What's so funny?

93
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:32,175
It's pitiful. Even you, once called the
God of Shinobi, can't defy aging.

94
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,736
What is that? What's going on?

95
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,998
Who's that young person?

96
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,500
Who are you?

97
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:58,158
Can't understand because it's too sudden for you? 
It's me, Orochimaru.

98
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:04,958
You aren't saying... you've completed that forbidden jutsu?!

99
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:14,118
It's scary how much un-human you are.

100
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,484
I've finally caught up with you.

101
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,356
This is the end for you guys.

102
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,080
Shit.

103
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,969
I won't let you escape.

104
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,518
Orochimaru, you were truly the genius
that appears once in a few decades.

105
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:59,755
I wanted to believe you are the one
who'll carry my strength and will,

106
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:04,145
but my optimistic thinking created this situation.

107
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:09,229
I'll end you and will correct my old mistake.

108
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:13,630

Hokage's mistake
