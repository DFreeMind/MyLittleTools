2
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:38,207
It was worth it teaching you Genjutsu during the
survival exam to decide whether you guys become Genin.

3
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:41,989
You have the talent for Genjutsu, as I thought.

4
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:47,099
Release the Genjutsu and wake Naruto and Shikamaru up.

5
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,066
I'm sure Naruto will be happy.

6
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,954
It's the first mission after a long time.

7
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,216
A mission?

8
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,419
Take it with care.

9
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:02,121
It's another A-rank mission like the Wave country mission.

10
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:09,075
I was waiting for it! It's an A-rank Mission!!

11
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:18,280
Sensei! What're we going to do with
an A-rank mission in this situation?

12
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,009
Sasuke is chasing Gaara of the Sand and his company.

13
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:29,644
Sakura, you will track down Sasuke after
releasing the Genjutsu on Naruto and Shikamaru.

14
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,957
It does worry me... that strange chakra.

15
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,878
But, if that's the case, I should
wake Ino and Choji, and go with more...

16
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:56,210
There are probably a large number of Shinobi's
from the Sand and Sound in this village already...

17
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:04,686
Moving around with more people than the basic four-person unit
will loose speediness and make it harder to  hide from enemies.

18
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:10,013
You learned that in the patrol-training
from the Academy, didn't you?

19
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:15,847
That's right. So, four people
means you are coming with us, too?

20
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:18,928
No, I can't leave here.

21
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,300

Kuchiyose-no-Jutsu

22
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:31,249
From here, Pakkun will track down Sasuke by his scent.

23
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,159
If I'm understanding you correctly...
the last one is this doggy?

24
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:43,207
Hey, little girl. Don't call me a cute doggy.

25
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,079
I didn't say "cute"...

26
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,361
Alright, Sakura. Release the Genjutsu on Naruto and Shikamaru.

27
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:52,356
Yes.

28
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:08,841
Kai! (Release)

29
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,468
Huh...? What's up, Sakura chan?

30
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,149
Get down!

31
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,084
We'll talk later. Just stay down.

32
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:36,514
Shikamaru... from the beginning you...

33
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,806
Ouch!

34
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:48,175
You also were able to do Genjutsu-gaeshi
(counter-Genjutsu)! Why were you pretending to be sleeping!?

35
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:55,162
I don't want to be involved. I
refuse to. Who cares about Sasuke.

36
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,101
Ouch!

37
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,431
What's going on?

38
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,893
Behind you!

39
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:26,684
Fast!

40
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,452
Not just fast.

41
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:40,946
Now, I'll tell you the mission. As soon
as you hear it, leave from that hole.

42
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:48,759
Go after Sasuke and join him to stop him.
And until further order, stay at a safe place.

43
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,937
What happened to Sasuke?

44
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,979
I'll explain as we go.

45
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:54,579
We're leaving!

46
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,655
Damn it... why me?

47
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,169
Hey kid...

48
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:08,467
If this mission is succeeds, I'll let you
touch my footpad as reward. So, don't complain.

49
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,339
What?

50
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,036
See? It's Puri-Puri (soft but tense).

51
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,898
Puri puri...

52
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:21,389
No. It's more like... PURI PURI!!

53
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:26,794
Anyway's, let's go.

54
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,445
Is it alright with just those four?

55
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:39,247
They have Pakkun with them, so it'll be alright for now.

56
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:42,365
As long as they don't get in too deep.

57
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:04,498
I can fight with you again...

58
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,393
This Kekkai can only be broke from within...

59
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:18,698
If Hokage-sama could beat one of those
four, then we can join him to fight.

60
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,363
Hey, it's going to start soon.

61
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:25,372
Create Kekkai inside, too.

62
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:26,096
Alright.

63
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:45,425
I see it's not so easy to get out from here.

64
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:53,521
You're saying something that you don't even think... It's
worse for you to have somebody coming in to pull your leg.

65
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,592

Ninpo-Kawara-Shuriken

66
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,885
It isn't enough...

67
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,227
Senei-Jashu

68
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:29,689
Just with this level of attack... don't
want to get older, do we, Sarutobi sensei...

69
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,715
Kawarimi...

70
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:47,175
Doton
Doryu-taiga (Earth Mud-River)

71
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,997
Your level is only this much?

72
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,609
I won't let you...!

73
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,073
Doton Doryu-dan (Earth
Mud-Cannon)

74
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:02,340
Karyu-dan (Fire Cannon)

75
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,348
Combining Doton and Katon... That's the Hokage-sama!

76
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,263
Stop your stupid pretend playing, Orochimaru.

77
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,187
After all it's you...

78
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:40,276
But I am underestimated, I see. You thought
you could kill me with such level of Jutsu?

79
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:44,838
You're without charm, just like before.

80
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:53,699
Well, don't say that. It's said that a student who demands more
of your attention is more adoreble isn't it? Sarutobi-sensei?

81
00:09:56,716 --> 00:10:01,326
Self Study

82
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:15,749
It's strange. All classes of the Academy
are told to do self-study... Plus that smoke.

83
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,793
It's the direction of the exam arena.

84
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:24,020
Isn't it noisy to the East?

85
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,685
I wonder if something happened.

86
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,410
It really is strange.

87
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:43,323
But, I don't like it when they tell us to do
self-study all of the sudden. It's been a while.

88
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:49,011
Yeah. Iruka sensei isn't late... Right, Konohamaru-kun?

89
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,688
What is this?

90
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:07,897
My mom just bought this for me recently!

91
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:11,217
You can borrow my color pencil.

92
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:19,767
What're you saying! This color is a new color
out this spring! Man... what should I do?

93
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,617
That is...

94
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,371
I wonder if Naruto-kun and
others went to stop Sasuke-kun.

95
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:46,997
Those kids did? Well, no matter how
many Genins make moves, it's nothing...

96
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:53,244
Is this the data of that kid?

97
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,318
You worry too much.

98
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,053
You're wrong.

99
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:03,376
They'll take your feet, if you are careless.

100
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:30,602
Teacher's room

101
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:34,991
I heard the information that there're a
number of units in the village already.

102
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,940
I think we should take the students to a safe place quickly.

103
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:44,893
Right. Plus, without making the students panic.

104
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:50,186
Then, tell them that this is an emergency
practice, and quickly take them to...

105
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,114
Won't we stop playing around now? Since
this is not a class of the Academy.

106
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,487
You're right.

107
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:15,680
I see you were expecting to die.

108
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:58,730
I won't go easy just because you're old.

109
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:07,927
That's my wish. Depending on your Jutsu performance,
you may need to go back to the Academy again.

110
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,763
Don't disappoint so much.

111
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:30,584
Amazing! What chakra...

112
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:34,135
Yeah. It's like the air is pressing down on my entire body.

113
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,695
Shuriken Kagebunshin no jutsu

114
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,537
Kuchiyose Edo Tensei (Summoning the Dead)

115
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,115
That jutsu is...

116
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:54,740
One.

117
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:59,921
Using Kuchiyose as shield... and those dead people are...

118
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,682
Two

119
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:05,597
I have to stop the third one no matter what...

120
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,240
Three

121
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:23,580
I couldn't bring the thrid one, I see. Well, it's ok.

122
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,316
I was able to prevent the third one,
but... it's going to be very hard from now.

123
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:38,604
Of all, he brought those two people.

124
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,695
No way. Those two people are....

125
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,222
Those two people?

126
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:05,196
Well, what're you going to do, Sarutobi Sensei? No...

127
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:16,429
the Third Hokage sama.

128
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:23,778
Everybody, move quickly.

129
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:34,619
Man, today isn't a good day... my favorite
color pencil didn't need to break like that.

130
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,765
An emergency practice... I prefer self-studying.

131
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:44,381
Konohamaru-chan has been quiet... what's wrong with him?

132
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:45,810
yeah.

133
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:54,104
After all classes do the self-studing, now all classes do
an emergency practice together... It truly is too strange.

134
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:57,529
Ok. Stop walking and get in line.

135
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,961
Iruka-sensi's face... there must be something.

136
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:08,793
and

137
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:14,777
Everybody listen. Do not leave here by yourself.

138
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:26,420
I've been thinking about it... that rainbow.

139
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:36,740
Hey Old man. There's a strange rainbow over there.

140
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,038
It's a rare rainbow.

141
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,281
Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?

142
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:53,466
Yup. And I've never seen such beautiful rainbow before.

143
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:58,155
I see, I see. But Konohamaru.

144
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,162
What?

145
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:08,988
It's been said that a rainbow is a symbol
of snakes, and sign of bad things to happen.

146
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:14,140
For such a beautiful thing? It must be a lie.

147
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:17,470
I see... I see...

148
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:27,775
A symbol of a snake... what's going on now?

149
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:45,107
Long time no see, Saru.

150
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:49,420
Oh, it's you. You've aged, Sarutobi.

151
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:56,510
Who imagined I would meet you two brothers again in this way.

152
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,193
I regret it.

153
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,317
This isn't good.

154
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:02,219
That Kuchiyose....

155
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,618
Who are those people anyway?

156
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,816
Be prepared, Shodai-sama (The First)

157
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,721
and Nidaime-sama (The Second)

158
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:19,223
That's right. The one with black hair is
the First, and the white hair is The Second.

159
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:25,702
Both were praised as the best Shinobi, and together
they are the Hokage-sama's who founded Konoha.

160
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:38,889
Edo Tensei... this the young man who summoned
us with the forbidden jutsu, is he? Such a man.

161
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:48,209
That means we have to fight against you, Sarutobi.

162
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:54,044
Let's stop the old man's reunion
chat, and let's started it already.

163
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:57,154
It's war in any days.

164
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,331
You like it, don't you?

165
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:05,964
You're playing with dead people. It
won't be good to play around with time.

166
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:17,261
I see. That's what was going on.

167
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,648
Sasuke hurried too much.

168
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:27,426
And why do I need to be here? Super troublesome.

169
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:31,179
No choice. It was Kakashi sensei's order.

00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:35,310
This way!

171
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,957
That kid, huh?

172
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,655
Let's go!

173
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,374
Damn it. It's too eary to be chased.

174
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,489
We will all die if we Genins are caught by them.

175
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,040
Then, should we beat them up by waiting and hiding?

176
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,223
I thought of it, but it won't work.

177
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:00,477
Then what should we do?

178
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:04,858
Whatever you say, there's only one way we can take.

It's troublesome but I've got to do it!!

180
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,639
It isn't my character, but I guess I've got to do it.
