00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:14,013
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:33,766
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:39,638
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:45,738
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,025
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:04,999
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:17,638
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:24,048
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,250
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,168
Stop that!

12
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:49,476
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!

13
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:54,548
I'm not handing Gantetsu over
to you, no matter what!

14
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,372
That's...

15
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,808
It can't be...!

16
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,540
<i>To Each His Own Path</i>

17
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,848
You... You mean you ripped
through my net?!

18
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:37,082
I can cut through a weak flimsy net
like that with a single bite!

19
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,928
It's useless! You won't be able to
tear through my Mesh Cage!

20
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,965
I'm gonna have Gantetsu back!

21
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,907
I'm telling you, it's useless!

22
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:01,910
Damn it! I can't get this thing off!

23
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,848
Here, just die already!

24
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:08,123
- Naruto!
- Naruto!

25
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,791
You're mine!

26
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,138
Too bad!

27
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,875
So it's you who's gonna die,
after all!

28
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,243
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

29
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,048
Go!

30
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,342
This is the end for you!

31
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:50,765
What's that?!

32
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,601
Shura, on the scene!

33
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:00,707
The kid! The kid inside that net
knows where the treasure is!

34
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,846
Good job, Monju!

35
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:15,280
Akio!

36
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,791
Akio...?!

37
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:22,159
- Akio! Bro!
- Akio! Bro!

38
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,138
Thank you.

39
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,207
Gantetsu...

40
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,005
I heard you say the name Akio,
just now...

41
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:36,845
Who in the world is that kid?

42
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:40,304
That kid... Akio...

43
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,347
He's your...
He's your little brother.

44
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:50,484
Th That's a lie!

45
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,891
My younger brother...
My younger brother has...

46
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,228
In those flames...

47
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:08,610
<i>Akio...</i>

48
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,078
You... killed him...!

49
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:19,120
No!

50
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,451
Gantetsu hasn't killed anybody!

51
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:24,858
He rescued us! He rescued Akio!

52
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:27,862
Five years ago.

53
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,893
I had developed a distate for
the Ninja Dropout's way...

54
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,403
I found myself carrying Akio...

55
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:37,872
<i>Akio!</i>

56
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,444
<i>Elder brother!</i>

57
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:45,605
<i>No! You'll inhale smoke!</i>

58
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:52,520
<i>Damn it!</i>

59
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:57,819
I thought I could change a little
if I could only save that child.

60
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,024
But that's not what happened!

61
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,529
I just continued to create
victims like Akio.

62
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:12,906
So that's why I started planning
what's happening right now

63
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,738
in order to exterminate
the Ninja Dropouts.

64
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,339
So that's what happened...

65
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,583
- Gantetsu!
- Gantetsu, are you all right?

66
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,945
You're not hurt, are you?

67
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:27,183
I'm glad you're ok.

68
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,787
They are children from the houses
that the Ninja Dropouts attacked...

69
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,851
Using the money Gantetsu poached
from the gang,

70
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,490
Akio, the oldest, has been
taking care of them.

71
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,999
Gantetsu is just like
the central figure of a family.

72
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,073
I can't believe this...

73
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,907
You mean that... the kid who
was there just now was...

74
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:26,007
Akio!!

75
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:42,990
Where are you going... Gantetsu?!

76
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,931
To the Ninja Dropouts' hideout.

77
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,701
I'm gonna get... Akio back!

78
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,836
I will get Akio back! Your only job
is to guide me there!

79
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,576
Don't interfere!

80
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:01,180
Todoroki, I understand how you feel.

81
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,145
However, Gantetsu saved Akio
and all these other kids

82
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,414
from the Ninja Dropouts!

83
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,651
Besides, there's something
you should do before that!

84
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:09,891
Don't mess around with me!

85
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:15,627
Even so, this guy... Gantetsu...
is a member of the Ninja Dropouts.

86
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,261
The Ninja Dropouts killed my parents!

87
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,834
You're absolutely right.

88
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,337
My own crime will never
be washed away.

89
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:33,510
As soon as I get Akio back...
you can... do whatever you like to me!

90
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,516
I'm going, too!

91
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:39,620
Me, too!

92
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,683
Then, Sakura, please look
after the children!

93
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:43,858
Leave it to me!

94
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:14,622
Todoroki...

95
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:19,617
I've continued hating that guy
for five years...

96
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:29,402
What am I supposed to do now...?

97
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:31,372
Damn it!

98
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,172
In any case, we've got to take care
of your little brother right now!

99
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:39,514
I know that!

100
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:43,481
This time for sure...
I'll rescue Akio!

101
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,669
Where did you stash our treasure?!

102
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,705
Where's your hideout?!

103
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,773
Come on! Talk!

104
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:15,106
I'll never... tell you!

105
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,378
You little brat!

106
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,894
That's the Ninja Dropouts' hideout...

107
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,991
That residence belongs
to Shura, the leader.

108
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,797
I'm pretty sure that's where Akio will be.

109
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,608
Akio...

110
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,914
Oh! Hey! Todoroki! Wait!

111
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,616
Damn!

112
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,686
This ain't good! They'll detect us!

113
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:21,307
Leaf Hurricane!

114
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,318
Let me handle this situation!

115
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,549
I leave it to you, Bushy Brows.

116
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,051
Akio!

117
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:34,528
This way.

118
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:40,468
I'm pretty sure that Akio is
being tortured in the basement...

119
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,795
That guy was once a Ninja.

120
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,171
There's no telling what
he'll try to do.

121
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,637
I'll go first.

122
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:07,395
Akio!

123
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:08,856
W Wait!

124
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,158
Akio...!

125
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:14,493
Gantetsu...!

126
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:15,770
You jerk...!

127
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:16,804
Don't come over here!

128
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,442
Gantetsu!

129
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:22,743
Akio!

130
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,206
Hey! Gantetsu!

131
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,780
So only one animal got caught
in the net, huh...?

132
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,054
Shura!

133
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:37,391
He's one stubborn brat.
He never unsealed his lips.

134
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,823
I'll use another method to
get back the treasure.

135
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,761
After I've killed the lot of you!

136
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,348
Naruto, pursue Shura!

137
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:13,092
We'll be fine! Iron bars
like this are nothing!

138
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,023
Got it!

139
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,725
Todoroki, I'm leaving this
in your hands!

140
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,161
Farewell.

141
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,208
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

142
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,053
Todoroki, you take care of Akio!

143
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,290
Todoroki!

144
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,149
Blood Rain!

145
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:42,338
I won't forgive you...
no matter what!

146
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,071
Rasengan!

147
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,511
<i>So that's what happened...</i>

148
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:30,081
<i>Gantetsu...</i>
<i>that's how you protected Akio...</i>

149
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,956
<i>Yet I... I...!</i>

150
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,489
Gantetsu! Give me Akio!

151
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,795
Elder brother...
you came to rescue me, after all...

152
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,904
Hang in there, Akio!

153
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:22,500
My elder brother...
Todoroki, it's really you, isn't it?

154
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,072
This spells the end of the Ninja Dropout.

155
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:56,610
Yeah...

156
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,778
That's right.

157
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,405
But where is Naruto?

158
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,048
Hey!

159
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,680
Naruto Uzumaki! On the scene!

160
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,457
Naruto! Lee!

161
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,663
Akio!

162
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,095
Akio's back!

163
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,197
It's Akio...!

164
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:26,997
Are you all right, Akio?!

165
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,175
Yeah...

166
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,641
Oh my gosh, you're hurt!

167
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,639
I'm fine. It's nothing!

168
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:36,249
Sakura, could you
take care of his wound?

169
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,418
Leave it to me.

170
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:40,954
Take care of him.

171
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:50,829
Apologies for the inconvenience...
Let's head to the capital.

172
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,268
I just cannot forgive you.

173
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,873
But it is true that you rescued Akio.

174
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,441
The Ninja Dropouts
have been annihilated.

175
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,650
Gantetsu got caught up
and died in the fighting

176
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:15,279
that ensued while being escorted.

177
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,625
Elder brother...

178
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:20,761
Todoroki...

179
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,136
Yeah! Great! That's great!

180
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,572
You're gonna stay here, right?

181
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:39,346
Huh?

182
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:43,980
You're gonna stay here with Gantetsu
and the other children, right?

183
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,852
I haven't been a good brother...

184
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:55,460
But you are an irreplaceable
elder brother for those children.

185
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,398
Elder brother...

186
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,838
What's this...?

187
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:06,573
This is the souvenir that

188
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:07,608
I didn't have a chance to
give you back then.

189
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,608
Elder brother... Thank you.

190
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,718
Let's go! Ninja!

191
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,229
Okay!

192
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,629
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

193
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:32,994
- Take care, everyone!

194
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,034
- See you!

195
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:42,300
- Bye!
- See you!

196
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:57,214
Hey... How are we gonna
get out of this forest...

197
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,156
without Gantetsu?!

198
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,652
We can't go back now!

199
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:03,630
We took this path earlier
on too, didn't we...?

200
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,224
I'm starving...

201
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,323
I can't go on.

202
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:14,365
Hey! Somebody rescue us!

203
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:23,647
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

204
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:29,987
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

205
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:39,797
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

206
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:44,395
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

207
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:49,341
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

208
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,211
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

209
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:59,185
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

210
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:03,417
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

211
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:07,894
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

212
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:15,300
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

213
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:19,203
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

214
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:24,472
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

215
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:28,606
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

216
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:33,484
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

217
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:38,181
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

218
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:44,323
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

219
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,437
Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?

220
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,203
What? I only brought an injured person
to the hospital.

221
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,302
But to bring an outsider
into the village...

222
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,609
But I'm sure he is not a bad guy at all.

223
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,411
I understand your feelings,
but he has amnesia.

224
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,384
There is a possibility that
he's an enemy spy.

225
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:06,442
Please, Grandma.

226
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,351
I'll make an exception,
just this one time.

227
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:12,023
But you will be his keeper, and will be
held accountable for all his actions.

228
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,193
That's all.

229
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,091
Next time: "Vanished Memories"
