Muoviamoci.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,030
They are near!

22
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,860
The adversaries are still two.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,320
while we are in three.

24
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,830
We are three against two.

25
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,870
If ce we play it well,

26
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,750
this could be the last crash.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,500
We go allora!Forza!

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000
Ce we will make it!

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,790
Not! We are four against two!

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,720
Sure, sure…

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
Scusami… four against two.

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,560
This time we will close in a hurry
the game with our technical new!

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,440
Ah ?

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,230
Then I could execute a Kage Bunshin
of dimensions never seen before!

35
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,530
Then that we can be calm.

36
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,400
But  per.primo.cosa my plan is respected.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,780
You have understood?

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,500
Remembered that we must find them before the sunset.

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,040
, I know it!

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,210
We increase the step!

41
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,270
The sun is tramontando.

42
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,930
Jiroubou and Kidoumaru are not returning.

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,060
Task that is making more hard work of the previewed one.

44
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,230
Who if of frega.

45
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,150
We must before think
to our Orochimaru-sama getlteman

46
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,990
In average day we have covered
only a third party of the route.

47
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,590
They have all of seals cursed.

48
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,050
The other time you have picked to us of surprise,

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,470
but it will not be repeated.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,390
There are too many interferences.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,020
Eternal damnation.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,730
We do not know not even if we will make in time.

53
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,780
Eternal damnation, we have not still caught up them!

54
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,580
Not, it goes well.

55
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,620
We must only continue to hold the same one
distance between of we, and to continue to follow them.

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,540
What you are saying ?

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,050
It means that we must avoid whichever
crash before that the sun rises.

58
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,380
you stop it to lose time in sciocchezze!

59
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,970
How you make rilassarti a lot ?

60
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,010
It has reason!

61
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,180
We are trying to attack them, would not be
better to make taking advantage of it the dusk?

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,150
The dusk will be an advantage for we
when we must attack.

63
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,530
In that moment,

64
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,490
to take Sasuke and to scappare to the sure one
it will be nearly impossible.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,170
If we will not succeed to take endured it,
they will increase the defense of the barrel.

66
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,590
This means that we will succeed
to act in the shadow.

67
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,510
From that moment they will not waste more energies.

68
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,140
If we had had the byakugan it would have been an other history.

69
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,100
Hey, hey six forgotten to you about Akamaru and my olfatto one ?

70
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,530
I have already put R-on account your abilities,

71
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,740
but they are stronger than we.

72
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,830
If  I will not be able  to use my technique,
it will be totally useless.

73
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,630
If I used the Kagemane in order to stop them,

74
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,670
and one cloud bloccasse the moonlight
the effects would vanish.

75
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,760
There are too many risks.

76
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,390
But cos ì -

77
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,640
I will make!

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Naruto!

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
You the six head!

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,640
I will follow  your orders, Shikamaru.

81
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,100
, it makes it please.

82
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,240
Episode #118
The rescue!
We must arrive in time to the barrel!

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,620
Hey Tayuya,

84
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,790
ce we will make it in time ?

85
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,830
We must carry Sasuke-sama within tomorrow.

86
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,540
In order tomorrow, eh ?

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,300
I am not saying that he will be simple,

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,090
but task that we will succeed ourselves.

89
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,380
, ce we will make it.

90
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,610
Orochimaru-sama.

91
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,860
Sasuke....

92
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,990
Sasuke still has not arrived ?

93
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,040
Not there is more time.

94
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,210
By now it is to the limit.

95
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,580
Orochimaru-sama,

96
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,960
if it is a body that you want some we have very many to disposition.

97
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,800
and in the case…

98
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,180
Not, I want only Sasuke.

99
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,600
How many tasks that it has waited for ?

100
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,520
But we are in one emergency situation!

101
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,600
The technique of maledizione of the 3 Hokage is more strongly of the previewed one!

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,980
Its maledizione is too much strong!

103
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,240
You take this!

104
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,410
Fuuin Jutsu!

105
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,870
Shiki fuujin!

106
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,010
What happens?

107
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,890
You take this!

108
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,030
My arms…

109
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,880
if you do not decide to be reincarnated now,
risked to lose all!

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,630
You want this !

111
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,260
To lose all !

112
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,230
I have prepared of the optimal ones chosen.

113
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,730
Trusted you me please!

114
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,820
After  I will take care myself  also of the recovery of Sasuke.

115
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,450
I will use  Kimimaro.

116
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,220
That you are cursed… Sandaime!

117
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,860
Release!

118
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,380
You listen to me well!

119
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,370
You fight some finchè will not remain only one.

120
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,370
Sopravviverà who will be able to exit of cell.

121
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,980
As I thought,

122
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,700
they have not been called not even this time.

123
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,160
Kabuto-sensei.

124
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,780
I…

125
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,450
You it thinks next to your body.

126
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,870
You have already carried out your role.

127
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,380
That one by now is one square of four elements, and you of six outside.

128
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,800
I am… still…

129
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,890
Your successor already has been found.

130
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,980
Moreover… its force equals yours seals of the earth,

131
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,400
inasmuch as it it has been donated I seal of the sky.

132
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,710
I asked who for you two is strongest.

133
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,510
What takes to you!

134
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,510
You do not have to be churned…

135
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,610
Kabuto-sensei…

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,570
How much me remains living?

137
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,490
Better E' if it does not speak more.

138
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,960
The persons are born for one reason....

139
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,010
.... in the life they have a task important to acquit.

140
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,800
Here why I have understood.

141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,110
The meant one of the life…

142
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,910
is to find one scope....

143
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,120
it is the only freedom that of i
they have granted to the men.

144
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,840
I understand  that  that you want to say.

145
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,050
Effectively our getlteman
Orochimaru-sama is suffering,

146
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,930
it crosses a condition that has not never experimented.

147
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,010
But  I will be  frank…

148
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,430
what you could make reduced like six ?

149
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,390
You have already lost your value like container.

150
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,400
Hour is a new container....
that one is heading towards the village.

151
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,950
Bè, even if is already too much late.

152
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,500
You had said that you would have let out me!

153
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,750
I ask that the promise comes maintained!

154
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,340
What you are waiting for ?

155
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,880
You move to open that door!

156
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,650
Still ?

157
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,490
You  I will make  endured -

158
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,020
It does not go well....

159
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,690
… it will divorerà to me!

160
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,320
I will let out  you  from here.

161
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,950
Moreover  esaudirò  also an other desire.

162
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,510
I ask you to free my clan
that you had captured for your experiments.

163
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,180
It will be made.

164
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,030
Not preoccuparti. This your strong will
it will continue to survive within of me.

165
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,910
All it will not go lost.

166
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,120
Then I take your body.

167
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,300
For some year it will have a body
in which the resurrezione will not work.

168
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,260
But  there will be an other occasion.

169
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,430
Effectively…

170
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:16,440
… I am not worth null like container
for the technique of the resurrezione.

171
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,610
Having lost all…

172
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,450
… it was difficult to find the scope to me of my life.

173
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,240
Hour  but  they are successful finally
to understand which it is.

174
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,540
Even if  I will not make  from container,

175
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,790
I  will be to carry that new one here.

176
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,920
Also to cost of living....

177
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,970
E' my thanks for
my getlteman, Orochimaru-sama.

178
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,260
E' the last thing that  can  make a useless being like me.

179
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
It waits for a moment!

180
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,820
We are already in proximity?

181
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,490
Not, it still wants much to us.

182
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,700
Rather…

183
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,630
What has arranged those cretini of Jiroubou and Kidoumaru !

184
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,340
We have caught up to you!

185
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,800
And it goes well!

186
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,970
I will kill  to you  in four and quattr' eight!

187
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,020
Cos ì  to the unexpected one ?

188
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,980
You take this!

189
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,820
Kareken!

190
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,160
The chakra on its hand ?

191
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,500
Kage bunshin, eh ?

192
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,880
Rasengan!

193
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,720
My hand!

194
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,050
I have stopped to you before that you can make
whichever thing. Useless E' all!

195
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,930
Kiba, hour!

196
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,060
Tsuuga!

197
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,810
It was only a clone!

198
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,400
These smidollati small have joined for a direct onslaught.

199
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,450
They aim for a long time at this!

200
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,110
Not to think to go some to you via cos ì  easy!

201
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,910
Merda…

202
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,750
I feel myself in trap!

203
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,870
The Kagemane jutsu is not successful.

204
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,920
Small piece of merda…

205
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,380
It is coming!

206
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,880
Tayuya, what you are making l ì  impalata ?

207
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Not!

208
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,180
What you are making!

209
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I cannot avoid it!

210
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,020
You take!

211
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,310
Perfect!

212
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,730
Kiba! Shikamaru!

213
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,360
Shikamaru! We must move!

214
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,030
Bastards!

215
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,160
Smidollato small, what you have dared to make ?

216
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,830
As I have said before, they
they have a heap of possibility.

217
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,380
They have distracted themselves too much.

218
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,050
Gone E' all good!

219
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,420
, all the second plans

220
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,930
The first one of the two passages
previewed it is completed.

221
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,650
I do not want to take you boys, gone via!

222
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,270

hajimete kimi to shabereta

242
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,230
Eternal damnation, we have walked too much, and has arrived a boy…

243
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,110
I have a prefeeling… is not a normal boy.

244
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,110
Cosè this brivido along the back ?

245
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,410
Now we are of the same number… 2vs2

246
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,080
But… this is…

247
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,750
Me dispiace naruto.

248
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,750
This boy is outside from your capacity.

249
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,840
