1
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,721
Exceeding the Limit...
Sasuke's Decision!!

2
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,142
Over there, eh?

3
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,008
Over here!

4
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:34,296
Damn..

5
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,559
I'll return them to you!

6
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,988
It was a clone..

7
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,853
Curse you..

8
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,471
Uchiha.. Sasuke!

9
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:04,554
Why are you hesitating?

10
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,009
Why do you..

11
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,161
..run away!?

12
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,650
Here!

13
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,040
Pass it!

14
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:46,776
Shoot!

15
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,915
What do we do?

16
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:59,348
We haven't mastered Wall Climbing no Jutsu yet..

17
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,857
Y.. you are..

18
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:20,412
Here..

19
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,571
Gaara..

20
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:23,587
It's Gaara of the Sand..

21
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,118
Run for it!

22
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:34,049
Wait!

23
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,024
Don't leave me alone!

24
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,054
Help!

25
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:43,724
I..

26
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,190
don't want to be alone..

27
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,313
anymore..

28
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,856
No!

29
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:07,131
Gaara-sama, please calm yourself!

30
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,623
Yashamaru..

31
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:47,769
I won't let you..

32
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,177
I won't let you run from me!

33
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:52,906
Uchiha Sasuke!

34
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,457
Damn it..

35
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,377
What's that incredible power?

36
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,898
Are you afraid of me?

37
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,366
It's too much..

38
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,012
Uchiha..

39
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,578
..Sasuke!

40
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:31,071
Afraid of my existence!

41
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:34,918
Don't forget..

42
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:37,863
You're my prey..

43
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,461
Hold it!

44
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,179
Why..

45
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,416
What is it you want from me?

46
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:01,709
Your eyes tell me that you know what true loneliness is..

47
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:03,617
Furthermore..

48
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:09,481
You also know that such solitude is the worst possible pain in the world..

49
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,804
I've told you..

50
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,181
You have the same eyes as I do..

51
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,968
The eyes, filled with hatred and death, that long for strength..

52
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,119
Just like mine..

53
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:34,692
Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness..

54
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,970
Yes, that look..

55
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,498
Alright, timeout..

56
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,756
Gaara, is it?

57
00:07:56,763 --> 00:08:00,006
I don't care what you think you know about Sasuke..

58
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,004
You shouldn't talk as if you can see Sasuke's inner self.

59
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:10,568
What were you trying to accomplish, coming all the way out here before your match?

60
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,035
Fighting is all about..

61
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:19,462
putting the lives of others and your own on the line..

62
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,926
To fight to the death..

63
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:30,306
Only then can the victor be assured of the meaning of his existence..

64
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,816
So you're saying you want a deathmatch instead of a tournament, is that it?

65
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,043
Uchiha..

66
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,617
You must be wishing for the same thing..

67
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:43,933
deep down inside..

68
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,985
You wish to determine if you deserve to live..

69
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:51,947
You wonder if you're really strong enough..

70
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:58,300
Stronger than the one you are dying to kill..

71
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,966
What's the matter..

72
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,662
Uchiha Sasuke!

73
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,655
Are you afraid of me?

74
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:34,143
Has your fear overtaken the hatred, the killing urge?

75
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:38,121
Is your reason for existence as puny as that?

76
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,185
Fight with me..

77
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,285
..and confirm it.

78
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,244
Verify your value..

79
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,865
your existence..

80
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,844
Feel it!

81
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:51,142
If you crave for an answer..

82
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,910
..come!

83
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,110
It was intentional..

84
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,484
only I was left alive..

85
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,640
But for what reason?

86
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,305
No..

87
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,257
I know why..

88
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:26,770
He let me live so that he doesn't have to feel guilty about killing the entire clan..

89
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:33,771
My brother Itachi chose me to be the avenger..

90
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,404
That's why he chose me!

91
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,244
Let me have some fun..

92
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,540
Uchiha Sasuke!

93
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,677
I'll finish this now!

94
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,838
End your suffering by dying quickly..

95
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,753
..you old man.

96
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,132
I told you already..

97
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,436
..you're going to die too.

98
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:54,929
You..

99
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:05,033
Get your hands off me!

100
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:08,835
I won't! No matter what..

101
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:12,750
Not until I pull out your soul completely!

102
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,463
At this rate..

103
00:12:59,244 --> 00:12:59,898
Gaara!

104
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,070
I felt it.

105
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,272
I see!

106
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,164
..so that's what it was!

107
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,046
Impossible..

108
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:40,449
He countered the transformed Gaara?

109
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,950
The reason I'm so excited..

110
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,769
I just got the answer.

111
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,772
It's this pain..

112
00:13:54,292 --> 00:14:00,362
Defeating a man strong enough to hurt me and utterly destroying him..

113
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:04,349
..that's what gives me an even greater sense of existence!

114
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:08,629
He wounded the invincible Gaara..

115
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,148
Not once but twice..

116
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:15,006
He's.. a monster..

117
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:16,651
No..

118
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,141
The real monster is..

119
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:25,591
After all, Gaara has only transformed his right arm so far..

120
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,665
More! I want more!

121
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,668
What?

122
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,050
What the hell is he!?

123
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,385
He keeps changing shape..

124
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,154
He's faster than before!

125
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:13,066
Dodging his attacks would be impossible if I wasn't reading his movements..

126
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:16,081
I would have been long gone without these eyes..

127
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,555
But..

128
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:22,322
Chidori isn't an option..

129
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:26,025
Fire Element - Blazing Fireball no Jutsu!

130
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,838
Seems like fire is useless against sand..

131
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,399
Besides, a jutsu of that level isn't..

132
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,701
Die!

133
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,465
Chidori is the only way after all..

134
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:10,010
Well, your limit is at two shots..

135
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,604
it seems..

136
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,364
Damn..

137
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:24,832
At your present chakra level, that's the most amount of times you can use Chidori a day..

138
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,767
In any case..

139
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,882
this is a jutsu that can't be used in a real fight unless you have the sharingan as well..

140
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:36,059
However, using the sharingan and the other jutsu at the same time is..

141
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,878
just the same as consuming all your chakra by detonating it inside your body..

142
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,691
Still, you're rather impressive, as I expected..

143
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,785
Even when I use Chidori, or Lightning Edge as it's otherwise known..

144
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,552
after four times in a single day I use up all my chakra..

145
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:07,920
If I attempt for a third one.. what would happen?

146
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,982
There would be no third one..

147
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,166
Never forget that.

148
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,934
When you try to strain the activation of a jutsu..

149
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,464
not only will the jutsu fail..

150
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,759
but you also lose all remaining chakra..

151
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:26,856
..and your life in the worst-case scenario.

152
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:34,411
Even if you survive, you'll still be in a tight spot no matter what..

153
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,110
especially if you have..

154
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,048
What's wrong?

155
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,783
Is this all your existence means to you?

156
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,113
Let me make it clear..

157
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,106
You..

158
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:57,768
..are weak!

159
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,898
You're too soft..

160
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,223
Your hatred isn't strong enough.

161
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:12,614
The power of hate is the power to kill..

162
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:16,787
The power to kill, is the power of vengeance!

163
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,576
Your hatred is weaker than mine!

164
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,507
Shut up..

165
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,705
Do you understand what that means?

166
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,261
Shut up!

167
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,779
It means..

168
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:39,897
..you're weaker than me!

169
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:46,385
Itachi chose me as an avenger..

170
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:50,002
..in order to have him killed.

171
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,912
I am an avenger!

172
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,291
The curse seal again..

173
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,121
Damn it..

174
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,566
Can't move..

175
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,182
Sasuke-kun!

Hey, Yashamaru..

179
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,193
..what is pain?

180
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,450
I've never been injured so..

181
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:57,488
I wonder what it's like..

182
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:02,026
Maybe I'm wounded..

183
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,793
Although it doesn't bleed..

184
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,723
..my heart hurts so much

185
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:08,516
It's suffocating..

186
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:11,157
..and somehow it's very painful.
