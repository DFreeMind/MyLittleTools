1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:03,451
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:06,286
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:12,388
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:28,847
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,981
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,492
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,019
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:51,659
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:56,700
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,775 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:07,550
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,714
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:19,527
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:54,966
<i>Viva Dojo Challenge!</i>
<i>Youth is all about Passion!</i>

16
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:59,860
It's been a while, hasn't it, Naruto?
Were you alone on a mission this time?

17
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,669
I just went to deliver
Grandma Tsunade's letter...

18
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:07,705
Is that so? Then you should
report to Lady Tsunade right away.

19
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,247
I know!

20
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:13,246
I've only been away for a week,

21
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,514
but it seems as though
an awful lot has changed.

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,381
DOJO CHALLENGERS,
COME THIS WAY
That sign wasn't here before, either.

23
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:22,354
Dojo challenget?

24
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,001
MAKE OUT VIOLENCE 3

25
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:31,936
This way?

26
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,267
This is a tight squeeze.

27
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:39,110
Is that it?

28
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:44,273
PASSION DOJO
"Passion Dojo."
Who on earth built this?

29
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:49,821
I've been waiting for you!

30
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:50,955
Huh?

31
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,689
You've come here
for a Dojo challenge, right?

32
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,762
Well, then.
Come at me from anywhere you like!

33
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:00,256
Huh? Bushy Brow?

34
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,324
If you don't make a move,
I'm coming at you!

35
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,959
What? Wait, hold it.

36
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,403
Hey, it's me!
It's only me, Bushy Brow!

37
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:12,043
Naruto!

38
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:16,147
Hey, that was close, I tell you!

39
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:19,282
So the first Dojo challenger
will be you, Naruto!

40
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,108
Well, I couldn't wish for
a better opponent!

41
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:22,620
Huh?

42
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,121
I'm going to go at this for real!

43
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,216
W Wait just a minute!

44
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,056
Leaf Hurricane!

45
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:33,598
Here...

46
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,766
So you just came to view the grounds?

47
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:40,333
Then you should have said so
in the first place.

48
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,334
I never even got a chance to tell you.
You just suddenly attacked me.

49
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,077
I'm really sorry about that.

50
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:53,142
Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?

51
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,584
Yes. I have been working on it
for quite some time

52
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,590
and finally completed it 6 days ago.

53
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,926
This flyer was distributed
not only in Hidden Leaf Village,

54
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,191
but in all the nearby
towns and villages as well.

55
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:07,432
You don't say?

56
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,266
I've been away on a mission
and have only just returned...

57
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,570
Is that so?

58
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:15,138
But why a Dojo?

59
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,568
It's all for training.

60
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,444
For training?

61
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:23,579
Well, actually, I've been busy
with missions lately

62
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,277
and have not been able to set aside
as much time for training as I'd like to.

63
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,882
And even on those occasions when
I was able to take time out...

64
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:34,790
it was difficult to find practice partners,
so I wasn't able to train efficiently.

65
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,424
Just when I was wondering
what I ought to do about it

66
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:41,898
YOUTH
I saw something in a village
I visited on a mission...

67
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,171
I request a challenge!

68
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,535
Please come this way.

69
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:51,943
Okay...

70
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:59,047
I have traveled near and far
in search of training...

71
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:02,453
I'd like to have a practice match.

72
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:06,480
But if I should win,
I'll claim your marquee.

73
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:11,625
A Dojo challenge, huh?
Very well, I shall have a match with you.

74
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,095
Here I come!

75
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,669
If I were to open my own Dojo,

76
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,801
someone with confidence in his skills
will surely come to challenge me!

77
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:32,379
So, I opened the Dojo thinking
it would give me good practice,

78
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,386
but nobody has come
to challenge me yet...

79
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:39,181
Hmmm... Is that so?

80
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:47,189
Say, since you're here, Naruto,
won't you try out for a Dojo challenge?

81
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,598
If you win,
I'll give you the sign I painted myself.

82
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,871
I have no need for such things.

83
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:56,732
Don't say that!
Please, by all means!

84
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:03,471
C Come to think of it,
I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!

85
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:04,841
I'd better go right away!

86
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:05,984
See you later!

87
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,119
Naruto!

88
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,316
Please be my first!

89
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:16,358
Damn it. I wasted so much time
thanks to Bushy Brow.

90
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,760
Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.

91
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:23,264
I'd better steer clear of Bushy Brow's Dojo
for the time being.

92
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,460
What's that I hear about Lee's Dojo?

93
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:27,832
<i>Intense Brow Sensei...?</i>

94
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:33,071
Naruto, what do you mean by that?

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,174
Do you mean to tell me
that he opened a Dojo to train himself

96
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,482
while I was away from the village
on a mission?

97
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,382
Splendid, if I may say so
about my own student!

98
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:50,224
I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!

99
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:55,656
But the all important Dojo challengers
are yet to appear... Not a single one.

100
00:06:57,736 --> 00:07:00,296
Damn those Dojo challengens!

101
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,734
To think that Lee's earnest hopes
have come to naught...

102
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,671
I'll search high and low
and give them a hit they can not forget!

103
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,511
But, if you do that,

104
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,208
you'll just make even less people
want to visit for a challenge.

105
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:15,084
Ah, that's right...
Whatever shall I do then?!

106
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:21,918
I've got it. If no one come
to challenge his Dojo, then...

107
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:28,991
Why don't I myself go to Lee's Dojo,
disguised as a Dojo challenger?

108
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,994
I'll play the part of Lee's first!

109
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,549
A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.

110
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,583
He wouldn't dream that
this was me, no way.

111
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,823
Here I come, Lee.

112
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,418
Guy Sensei!

113
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,060
I finally found you.

114
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:01,155
If it isn't Sakura!
What is going on?

115
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,428
Guy, forgive me for bothering you
when you've only just returned, but...

116
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:09,474
an emergency relief request has come in
from Shikamaru's squad,

117
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,566
which was assigned to
transport unit duty.

118
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,971
We know nothing whatsoever about
the true nature and scale of the enemy.

119
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,707
Therefore...

120
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,614
there is a possibility of this developing
into something major

121
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:21,949
if we err in our initial encounter.

122
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,821
Judging from reports,
they should be around here.

123
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,558
They're close by.

124
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:30,787
First, you go reconnoiter
to confirm the situation.

125
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:35,023
If they seem to need additional relief,
I will make immediate arrangements.

126
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,858
Yes, roger that.

127
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,700
Can that strange getup
have some significance?

128
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,646
I don't know...

129
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,519
What's with that strange fellow?

130
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:01,657
Well, no matter.
I'll borrow his form

131
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,524
to infiltrate Leaf Village.

132
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,924
The Village Hidden in the Leaves'
secrets...

133
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:13,629
I, Nanafushi,
shall investigate every last detail!

134
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,672
Was that guy really
looking for a Dojo challenge?

135
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,207
Yeah. That's what he claimed to be,
so there can be no doubt.

136
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:24,045
He says he came
because he saw the flyers.

137
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,344
I wonder if he got lost or something...

138
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:30,821
Intense Brow Sensei, how long
do you intend to keep us waiting?

139
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,255
Naruto, I think, after all, I'd like
to have you be a Dojo challenger...

140
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,166
<i>Oh no.</i>

141
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,334
I'll go look for him!

142
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,304
Naruto!

143
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:49,333
Let's work up a youthful sweat with me!

144
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:53,672
Oh, he returned after all.

145
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,272
I knew that get up would be problematic.

146
00:09:57,082 --> 00:10:00,449
<i>What?</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

147
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,588
Huh?

148
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:07,155
Sensei...?
What's with the strange disguise?

149
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,722
Everyone can still tell it's you!

150
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,625
I... I didn't think it was
such a great idea, either.

151
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,623
<i>What's the matter?</i>

152
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,627
<i>Don't tell me these guys</i>
<i>have discovered my true identify!</i>

153
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,401
Intense Brow Sensei!

154
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:24,907
Sensei!

155
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:25,802
Oh!

156
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:30,109
Quit lollygagging
and get over to Lee's Dojo!

157
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:30,648
Huh?!

158
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:34,276
If you don't go, then I'll have to fight him!
Come on!

159
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:36,821
Be seeing you!

160
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:39,452
I guess you could say...

161
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:40,923
That's typical of him...

162
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,224
<i>I'm safe thanks to this guy...</i>

163
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:48,197
<i>I should attach myself to him for a while</i>
<i>and scope out the situation in the village.</i>

164
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,538
What is this place?

165
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,672
This is Lee's Dojo!

166
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,471
But, really... Couldn't you have
come up with a little better disguise?

167
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,976
Well, never mind!

168
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:06,877
Lee must be tired of waiting,
so try to do a good acting job!

169
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,315
<i>Acting?</i>
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

170
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:13,090
I've brought him with me, Bushy Brow!

171
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,721
I've been waiting for you...!

172
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,728
Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!

173
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,233
<i>Huh...?</i>

174
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:26,002
Please come this way!

175
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:27,965
Um... um.

176
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:32,038
At time like this, you're supposed to say,
"I request a challenge match," right?

177
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:33,945
I I see...

178
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,775
I I request a challenge match!

179
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:41,710
Do I hear that familiar call?
You indeed are a Dojo challenger!

180
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:47,518
Fair enough! If you win,
you can have my marquee!

181
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:52,827
<i>Could it be that I've been</i>
<i>mistaken for a Dojo challenger?</i>

182
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:54,389
<i>Oh my god...</i>

183
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:55,933
<i>Huh?!</i>

184
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,627
<i>He's just a kid...</i>

185
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:00,900
<i>Well, it can't be helped.</i>
<i>I'll go easy on him...</i>

186
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:03,404
Okay! Here I come!

187
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,137
- Ready!
- Huh?

188
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:06,510
<i>He disappeared?</i>

189
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:10,915
Huh?

190
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,775
<i>Wh What happened... ?

191
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,349
<i>This little brat...!</i>

192
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,325
Take that! And that!
And this! And that!

193
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:24,752
<i>He's strong!</i>

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,363
<i>What's going on?!</i>

195
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:35,530
<i>I know you're only acting, but you're still</i>
<i>giving him too much of a break, Sensei.</i>

196
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:40,574
<i>Oh, I see. He's not fighting back because</i>
<i>it'll ruin his disguise!</i>

197
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,249
<i>Even if I had nine lives,</i>
<i>I'd never survive this fellow...</i>

198
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,385
<i>I think I'd better wave a white flag</i>
<i>and withdraw here.</i>

199
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,826
I I concede...

200
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,023
Then that means... I did it!

201
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:04,292
I splendidly fought off
my first Dojo challenger!

202
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,629
No, that's not it at all!

203
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:09,307
What he means by "concede"

204
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,865
is that he concedes
to be a Dojo challenger, right?

205
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:16,770
In other words,
he's just been warming up,

206
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,510
and now comes
the real challenge, right?

207
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,013
<i>No, that's not it at all!</i>

208
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,380
So that's what you meant, after all...

209
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,755
I thought it was odd that

210
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,990
that an experienced Dojo challenger
would surrender.

211
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,623
<i>It's not odd!</i>
<i>There's nothing odd about it at all!</i>

212
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,964
Well, then, I'll have to really
get down to business now, too!

213
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:42,002
<i>What?! You mean you haven't even</i>
<i>really gotten started yet?</i>

214
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,239
<i>Hey! Intense Brow Sensei</i>
<i>is a pretty good actor!</i>

215
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:54,179
<i>He's even taking more hits so that</i>
<i>Bushy Brow won't know it's him.</i>

216
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,182
What?
You were only attacked by monkeys?

217
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,958
They were after the snacks
that Choji procured

218
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:04,586
but the important load is safe!

219
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,561
My snacks... by a monkey...

220
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,733
Ino mistook that for
an enemy's attack

221
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,328
and sent out
an emergency relief request.

222
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:16,540
But, it was so sudden!

223
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,436
Anyway, it's your fault
for procuring so many snacks!

224
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:22,541
These snacks were available
only for a limited time,

225
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,514
and moreover,
only available in the Land of Tea,

226
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:26,982
the Super-rare
"Green tea Pork-flavored chips!

227
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:30,711
For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin
to refrain from buying

228
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,189
a limited offering of snacks
once one has found them!

229
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,987
Like I care about stuff like that!

230
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,093
What?

231
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,128
What?!

232
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:42,332
Shikamaru, things are tough for you,
aren't they?

233
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:46,726
Right back at you. That getup...
Did something happen?

234
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,074
Huh? What about my getup?

235
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,076
Here.

236
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,605
Oh, that's right!
I haven't got time for dallying here!

237
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,415
I've got to get over to Lee's dojo!

238
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,546
Just wait for me, Lee!

239
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,290
<i>You're overdoing</i>
<i>on purposefully getting beaten, Sensei...</i>

240
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,665
Is he finished now?

241
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,301
Whoa, hold it! Time out!

242
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,936
Fight back a little, will you?!

243
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,242
<i>It's impossible, I tell you.</i>

244
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,072
If Lee doesn't
find this challenging enough,

245
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:34,346
I might get stuck being his opponent.

246
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,083
Actually...

247
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:39,415
It's been one extreme mission
after another lately,

248
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,890
and I haven't gotten any sleep at all...

249
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,293
What? You don't say...

250
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:46,496
If I got a little rest,
I think I might recover, but...

251
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,693
While I take a rest,
won't you be his opponent for a while?

252
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,193
What?!

253
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:55,473
I'm begging you!

254
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,034
Wh What is that?

255
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,345
I'm coming, Lee!

256
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:04,675
G Guy?

257
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,811
I thought he already entered the village
a while ago...

258
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,081
S Sorry to keep you waiting!

259
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:16,720
You've weathered such an attack
and you're still undamaged...

260
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:17,761
You're quite a fellow!

261
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,688
The world is vast...

262
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,256
To think that such
an awesome Dojo challenger exists!

263
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,562
It was worth building this Dojo!

264
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:29,168
<i>There's no way I could win</i>
<i>with only Taijutsu!</i>

265
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,441
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>then I'll fight my own way...</i>

266
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,111
Here I come!

267
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,739
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

268
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:40,878
<i>But, of course! He's well acquainted</i>
<i>with Ninjutsu too!</i>

269
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,177
Leaf Hurricane!

270
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:45,816
<i>The real body is... right above me!</i>

271
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,184
Primary Lotus!

272
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,296
Is this a clone, too?

273
00:16:58,736 --> 00:16:59,703
Got you!

274
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,330
Here I go, one more time!

275
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,573
Another Shadow Clone?

276
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,243
<i>Nope...!</i>

277
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,537
Stop it, Lee.

278
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:10,906
S Sakura?

279
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,648
- Be nice, now!
- Don't be too hard on me.

280
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,345
- Please!
- Don't be mean!

281
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:20,822
So many Sakura...
Guy Sensei! I'm moved!

282
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:24,056
I've never known such happiness
before in my life!

283
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:25,456
- Cha!
- Cha!

284
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:26,931
Wha...?!

285
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:29,992
We did it!

286
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:36,362
I guess I forgot...
that this is a fight with a challenger.

287
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:40,500
Just as one might expect...
But I won't fall for the same trick again!

288
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:45,004
Even though they may look like Sakura,
they're really just phony Transformation!

289
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,418
How can you say that, Lee?

290
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,648
Hurry back, Sensei!

291
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,655
<i>For brats,</i>
<i>they fight such a high level fight...</i>

292
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:00,424
- <i>Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs...</i>
- How about this?!

293
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,897
<i>I wonder if the rumors that</i>

294
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,627
- <i>they lost its vigor were just lies?</i>
- In that case...

295
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:04,998
- <i>I guess I need to</i>
- Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

296
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:06,934
<i>Investigate this further...</i>

297
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:10,234
This disguise is problematic...

298
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,635
I get a feeling
I will be embroiled in trouble again.

299
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,213
<i>Let's go with this.</i>
<i>Well then, shall I be taking my leave?</i>

300
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:22,378
Hold it right there!

301
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:24,822
<i>The real thing!</i>

302
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:28,522
I see that you are Rock Lee,
master of this Dojo.

303
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:32,521
<i>Oh no.</i>
<i>I guess I'll have to play along with him...</i>

304
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,900
Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee,
master of this dojo...

305
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:43,406
I am a Dojo challenger!

306
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:48,139
Rock Lee, I shall defeat you
and claim your marquee!

307
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:50,714
Here I come!

308
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,948
You fight a pretty good fight.

309
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,623
You, too...

310
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,694
H Help!

311
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,157
B-Bushy Brow?!

312
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:13,427
Dynamic Entry!

313
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:18,137
A Another Dojo challenger?!

314
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,506
Intense Brow Sensei!
What took you so long?!

315
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:27,308
N -Naruto... what's the meaning of this?

316
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,517
If you can't dodge
even this much of an attack,

317
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:31,520
you are not worth all the talk!

318
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,623
Your training is inadequate!

319
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,157
N -No... This is... I mean...

320
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:40,791
It's about Million years too early for you
to be building your own Dojo!

321
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:46,134
I must straighten that spoiled attitude
of yours with my own fist!

322
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,142
Forgive me Lee...
It's my whip of love!

323
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:58,675
So, the true identity of the challenger
was you, Guy Sensei!

324
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:04,382
What? You're Lee?
Then, who was I punching?

325
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,259
Who's that guy?

326
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,731
Good grief...

327
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,628
Come in!
Oh, it's you, Guy...

328
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:21,966
And you're with Naruto and Lee.

329
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:26,737
That's perfect.
I was just about to call you all.

330
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,142
Has somethingthappened?

331
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,578
Just now, some intelligence came in...

332
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,749
A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys,
by the name of Nanafushi,

333
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,083
is said to have been seeking
inside information on our village.

334
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:41,186
He may already have
infiltrated the village.

335
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:46,186
I want you to go search for this Nanafushi
immediately and capture him...

336
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh!

337
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,034
That man...

338
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,160
You have an idea of where he might be?

339
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:54,629
- It's this guy!
- It's this man!

340
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:03,374
I don't really know what's going on...
but our mission is complete!

341
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,981
Well then, we'll be going.

342
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,108
Hey! Don't just leave him here!

343
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,077
Oh! Guy Sensei!

344
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:15,690
Explain what happened!
Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!

345
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:44,052
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

346
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,555
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

347
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,061
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

348
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,191
<i>Suggestively</i>

349
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:58,998
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

350
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:05,608
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

351
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:12,172
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

352
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:17,210
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

353
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:22,385
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

354
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:54,020
In the small hours of the morning
when the trees and grasses are asleep

355
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:56,582
and the forest is deafly calm...

356
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:02,264
A signpost standing forlorn
starts telling of the destruction of a clan.

357
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:08,231
Suddenly with a strike of thunder,
heavy rain begins to fall down.

358
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:13,438
What could be the true identity
of the Iron Castle that appeared?!

359
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:17,213
Next Time: " The Mysterious Curse
of the Haunted Castle"
