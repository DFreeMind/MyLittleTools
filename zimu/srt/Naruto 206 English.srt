00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:14,271
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:34,024
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:39,896
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:45,996
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:51,601
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:58,283
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:05,257
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:17,896
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:24,306
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:29,508
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,222
<i>No way...</i>

12
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:13,382
<i>To think Old Man Hokage would</i>
<i>try to eliminate Yakumo.</i>

13
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,222
<i>No way could that ever happen!</i>

14
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,196
<i>But if by some remote chance,</i>

15
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,732
<i>Kurenai Sensei</i>
<i>accepted such a mission...</i>

16
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,161
<i>it would explain her strange behavior.</i>

17
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,434
<i>No, no way!</i>
<i>No way that could ever happen.</i>

18
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,113
Are you okay, Kurenai Sensei...?

19
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:43,654
Yes. I feel quite a bit better now
thanks to your first -aid...

20
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:54,298
Who in the world is
Kurenai Sensei protecting?

21
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:58,200
It was the Third Hokage who
told her to take custody of Yakumo...

22
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,932
What in the world is her real mission...?

23
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:02,807
What's going on?!

24
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:15,712
Th That's...

25
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,788
Th The Village Hidden in the Leaves is...

26
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,450
No way...!

27
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:33,302
<i>Genjutsu or Reality?</i>

28
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,575
It's like the aftermath of
a large war that broke out.

29
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,112
Hinata!

30
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,547
Right...

31
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:42,581
Byakugan!

32
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:54,053
There's not a person in the village...

33
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:55,928
What is this...?

34
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,461
What's going on here?!

35
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,986
Kiba, Hinata...
Is there anything unusual in the area?

36
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,714
No enemy signs anywhere...

37
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,254
Akamaru doesn't sense
the scent of any outsiders, either.

38
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,393
What happened in the village
while we were away...?

39
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:38,066
First, let's take Yakumo and
Kurenai Sensei to the hospital.

40
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,864
We'll check out the village after that...

41
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:42,200
R-Right...!

42
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:56,347
Leaf Hospital

43
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:58,023
What's this...?

44
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,822
Anyway, let's get these two
to a hospital room...

45
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,639
I'm okay.
More importantly, take care of Yakumo.

46
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,108
Right...

47
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,234
You're out of danger now...

48
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,712
Oh, no... She's unconscious!

49
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,081
Her vital signs are weakening...

50
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,115
I wonder if there's any medicine left...

51
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,112
Naruto, help me look...

52
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,518
Oh, well, but...

53
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,751
Just hurry!

54
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:33,792
R-Right...

55
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,460
There's no scent of blood.

56
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,165
Everyone must have
evacuated somewhere.

57
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,968
Let's us check out the village.

58
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,472
Right...

59
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,702
Make sure you three
always act together...

60
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:52,772
Come back here in thirty minutes,
no matter what.

61
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:54,513
Right...

62
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,150
What is it?

63
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:02,846
Sure enough, you have to be the one
to give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!

64
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:20,638
What's been the matter with you?!

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,234
The pharmacy is that way.

66
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,907
Nothing. I was just concerned
about Kurenai Sensei...

67
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,704
So let's hurry and get the medicine!

68
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,509
I mean, Kurenai Sensei's going to...
eliminate... Yakumo...

69
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,154
Eliminate?

70
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,822
Th Th That couldn't be...

71
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,622
I was just kind of out of it.

72
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,828
Huh?

73
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,755
Huh? What was that?!

74
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:47,393
What is it, Sakura?!

75
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,526
There's someone here other than us.

76
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,836
What?!

77
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:57,409
That's close!

78
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,010
I'll leave the two in
the hospital room to you, Sakura!

79
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,045
I'm going after him!

80
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,082
Got it!

81
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:12,114
Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

82
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,293
Huh?! My Jutsu won't activate?!

83
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:31,238
Wait! This isn't the time
to be fighting.

84
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,441
You guys are the ones who
attacked the mountain cottage, right?!

85
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:37,309
I am Unkai of the Kurama Clan...

86
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,110
Kurama?!
The same clan as Yakumo?!

87
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,316
Why would her clan attack her?!

88
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,460
Listen to me!
If you don't, everyone will die!

89
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,977
What's this smell of blood?!

90
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,421
Byakugan!

91
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,325
Close your Byakugan, Hinata!

92
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,857
Kiba, restrain Akamaru's
sense of smell!

93
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,129
- What?!
- What is it?!

94
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,996
It's because we're caught
in someone's Jutsu.

95
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,407
Say what?!

96
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,702
Yes. We're now inside
Yakumo's Genjutsu.

97
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,141
It may seem as if the Leaf Village
was in a war.

98
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,478
But this is merely
a part of her Genjutsu.

99
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,957
This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu
and we've all been trapped in it?

100
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,495
That's totally impossible!

101
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:02,532
But if her latent powers have awakened,
it wouldn't be hard at all.

102
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:04,664
This whole village?!

103
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:09,538
This ground w e're standing on,
this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!

104
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:13,810
There are occasions when
superior senses become a hindrance.

105
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,775
It's because no matter how superior
the sense of sight or smell might be,

106
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:23,049
ultimately it's the human brain that
processes and perceives the information!

107
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:27,288
There are times when
well developed brains make errors

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,454
in the process of interpreting
complex electric signals.

109
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,457
However, insects act only
with sharp senses.

110
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,600
Unlike the information processed
with a human brain,

111
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,764
insects narrow this information down
to the very minimum.

112
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,838
Look. My insects
are still under control.

113
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,209
They will not be deceived.

114
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,645
There are occasions when

115
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,415
Yakumo's Genjutsu
summons thunderclouds

116
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,683
and produces fire.

117
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,921
And that is planted directly into
the human brain

118
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:04,053
as if it had occurred in reality.

119
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:09,258
And that causes the brain
to hurt one's own body.

120
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,637
Then, Grandma's house...

121
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,275
That's also Yakumo's power?!

122
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:20,904
It's not just that...

123
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,311
She can even kill people easily
if she were so inclined.

124
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,946
But these tremors...

125
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,285
Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?

126
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:34,860
You'll see any moment now...

127
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:49,498
A A snake!

128
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,971
It's too huge!

129
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,171
Is that also Genjutsu?!

130
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,676
It's a terrifying image that
our cerebrums have created.

131
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,275
Physical influence is absolutely...

132
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:03,889
unthinkable!

133
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,591
No way!

134
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,137
Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!

135
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:24,443
Huh?!

136
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:44,826
<i>Really... ? Yakumo can kill people</i>
<i>with Genjutsu... ?

137
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,927
<i>So is that why the Third Hokage</i>
<i>tried to eliminate her?</i>

138
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:08,314
Yakumo, Yakumo?!

139
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:17,185
<i>Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei...</i>

140
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,557
<i>Over here... Kurenai Sensei...</i>

141
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,409
I still can't believe it.

142
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,844
To think Yakumo would do
something like that!

143
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:38,814
Once every several generations,

144
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:43,082
a child is born into our Kurama Clan
with physical idiosyncrasies.

145
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:44,984
That child is Yakumo...

146
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:49,989
Moreover, what's terrifying is her
using her powers unconsciously

147
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:53,088
without being able to control it.

148
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,665
It's getting kind of hot.

149
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,878
Don't!

150
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,815
What's happening
outside the door...?

151
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,454
Don't open it!

152
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,989
Wh What's this...?

153
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,197
Why's there lava here...?

154
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:39,741
That's an illusion our brains have
created due to Yakumo's Genjutsu.

155
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:44,945
But even it's an illusion,
if we were to dive into the lava,

156
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:48,953
our brains would determine it to be lava
and our bodies would burn up.

157
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,819
That is Yakumo's power.

158
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:55,891
So is that why Old Man Hokage
and Kurenai Sensei

159
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,122
tried to eliminate Yakumo?

160
00:13:58,597 --> 00:13:59,723
That's not it.

161
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,766
What they really
attempted to kill

162
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,862
was the monster
existing inside Yakumo.

163
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,174
A monster?

164
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:13,735
Before too long,
Yakumo's massive powers

165
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,610
created a terrifying monster.

166
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,244
If left alone, the monster that
continues to grow would

167
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,412
someday attempt to
become one with her

168
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,752
by absorbing
Yakumo's consciousness.

169
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,255
The Third Hokage and Kurenai
determined as such

170
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:33,355
and all there was to do in order
to save Yakumo was to seal her powers.

171
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,066
A monster in her body...

172
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,005
So that's what it was...

173
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,436
I can't just sit back like this!

174
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,346
Oh!

175
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:53,410
Oh. My entire fortune!

176
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,853
I told you. If you dive into the lava,
you're body will really burn up.

177
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,024
Then does that mean
we can't get out of here?!

178
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,821
No, there is one way.

179
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,454
What's that way?!

180
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:11,000
If you seal your five senses,
the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.

181
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:14,864
You must escape from this world
and attack Yakumo!

182
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,464
What?! Attack Yakumo?!

183
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,214
Ow ow ow!

184
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,658
What? This is... Satomi Hill?!

185
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,868
Old Man Unkai!

186
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:51,800
It seems you safely made it
out of Yakumo's Genjutsu...

187
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,872
What the heck happened...?!

188
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:57,640
At the point you brought Yakumo
out of the mountain cottage,

189
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,313
you were already
caught in her Genjutsu.

190
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,554
What?!

191
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,756
Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!

192
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,822
Kiba!

193
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,502
Shino!

194
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,404
Wh Where are we...?

195
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:23,736
Sakura, examine
Old Man Unkai's wounds.

196
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:24,976
Unkai...?

197
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,448
What happened?!
These are awful burns!

198
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:35,214
We were able to get out of
Yakumo's Genjutsu

199
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,221
thanks to this old man!

200
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,724
Rather, I'd say
we w ere driven out...

201
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:46,621
Her only target was
Yuhi Kurenai, after all...

202
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,327
Where's Kurenai Sensei now?

203
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,193
Well, probably...

204
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,339
Yakumo...

205
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:35,478
Kurenai Sensei...
What do you think of my paintings...?

206
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:37,109
Aren't they wonderful?!

207
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,650
What did you do to everyone?

208
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:44,287
Don't worry...
I just drove out the intruders...

209
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:49,250
Eventually, I must have my revenge
on the Leaf Village...

210
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,260
But first, I have some business
with you, Sensei.

211
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,056
Why include the Leaf Village as well...?

212
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:59,137
I should be enough of a target
for your revenge...!

213
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,368
I won't let you say
you don't know!

214
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,315
How is it?
Awesome, huh?

215
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:27,056
I have complete control now of letting
you live or killing you, Sensei.

216
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:30,626
Tell me the truth...

217
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,907
It was the Third Hokage who ordered
my father and mother killed and

218
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:41,503
the Kurama Clan and me eliminated
from the Leaf Village, right?

219
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:42,981
No.

220
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:52,521
The Third Hokage did not order
such a mission...

221
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:54,582
Why do you lie?!

222
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,237
Please.

223
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:08,530
Tell me the truth!

224
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,772
You'll vanish if you don't,
Kurenai Sensei...

225
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,779
Such a sad child...

226
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,840
If killing me will eliminate your suffering,
then you should do it.

227
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,880
If your hate will vanish along
with your suffering!

228
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,324
Why do you cry?
I won't be deceived by tears like that!

229
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:38,301
1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!

230
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:44,806
Yeah, it feels good in
every kind of weather to sweat.

231
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,416
So the Kurama Clan are still here!
Might Guy will take you on!

232
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,679
W Wait, Guy!

233
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,888
Huh?! G -Guy?

234
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,497
I see. So you guys were also
caught in the Kurama Genjutsu...

235
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:11,736
I'm sorry.

236
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,902
Well, you're alive and
that's all that matters.

237
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:16,274
Thank goodness,
thank goodness.

238
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:20,411
Oh, you guys are back!

239
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:22,939
Where are the village reinforcements?!

240
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,013
There's no time to explain!

241
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,352
What?!

242
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,214
Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!

243
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,581
What's up with them?!

244
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,659
Who's that man...?
And what about everyone?

245
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,755
Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.

246
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:41,992
But, well...

247
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,532
Just hurry!

248
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:44,591
R-Right...

249
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:49,073
Byakugan!

250
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:54,545
Those jerks...

251
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,140
No, Yakumo!

252
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,945
Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei
are in the innermost room.

253
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,255
All right!

254
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,652
Hey, wait!

255
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,563
Kiba!

256

00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:40,021
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>

259
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:44,620

260
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:49,565

00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:53,330
Everyone, what's the current situation?

273
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:56,029
Naruto hasn't come back
since he first went in.

274
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,399
The insects had also detected
something strange and emerged.

275
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,233
Can you use your Byakugan
to look inside?

276
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:04,809
There's some kind of powerful force
that's getting in the way.

277
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,145
So all we can do is watch here?

278
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,940
Does this mean that all
we can do is believe in him and wait?

279
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,083
