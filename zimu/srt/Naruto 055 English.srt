2
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,449
Hey, Ero Sennin!

3
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,484
Aren't you supposed to be training me?

4
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,526
I'm gathering some material now.

5
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:04,049
Do it by yourself.

6
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:10,487
Alright... I'm going to summon a surprisingly huge frog!

7
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,625
Kuchiyose-no-jutsu
(Summon Technique)

8
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,925
Huh? What's up? Was a frog summoned?

9
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,230
Wa... Wait a sec!

10
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,911
What part of that thing is a frog?

11
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:35,650
Be quiet! I'm seriously trying hard!

12
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:39,638
If so, then try channeling chakra like you're gonna die!

13
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,987
I'm doing that!

14
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,195
Sasuke-kun...

15
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:31,832
Sakura!

16
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,930
Stop sleeping in so late and help me down here!

17
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:38,053
I'm not sleeping! I'm busy now!

18
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,695
Ok, Ok...Then tell me when you're not busy!

19
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:42,886
Later!

20
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,532
Seriously... Man...

21
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:59,617
Painful Feeling's A Single Flower With A Wish

22
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,046
Some of you may already heard of this, but...

23
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:09,459
Gekko Hayate's dead body was found near Kikyo Castle.

24
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,308
Was Hayate...?

25
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:12,628
No way!

26
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,258
I can't believe it!

27
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:17,596
Was it done by Orochimaru?

28
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:20,836
No. We can't come to that conclusion that easily.

29
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,559
Hayate was probably following the Sound spy, Kabuto.

30
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:29,901
Well, it's for sure that Orochimaru
is trying to do something, but...

31
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:34,244
Then cancel the Chunin exam, and let's take care of Orochimaru!

32
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:40,966
No. He revealed himself to Anko,
and threatened us to not stop it...

33
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:46,375
...the Chunin exam where all the ninja's gather at one place.

34
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:48,415
What does it mean?

35
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,007
Orochimaru has the ability to crush
a small country by himself alone.

36
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,223
Probably each country has been watching
him since he left this village...

37
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:04,999
In addition, he conviniently has a grudge against Konoha.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,748
Many countries want him.

39
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,239
Then, you're saying that...

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,448
our allies have betrayed Konoha by working with Orochimaru?!

41
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:20,199
Well, an alliance treaty is same level as verbal promise.

42
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,119
Exactly like the Ninkai Taisen was... (Great Ninja War)

43
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:27,596
Anyway...

44
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:33,372
We have too little information. Let's stop guessing needlessly.

45
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:37,885
We have already sent Anbu to
gather information in each country.

46
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,584
It's dangerous to move thoughtlessly.

47
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,730
It may be exactly what the enemy wants.

48
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,767
Besides...

49
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,287
I have faith in all of you.

50
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:07,984
In the worst case, all we have to do
is go to war with all of Konoha's power.

51
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:35,426
At that time...

52
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,435
Don't tell anyone about this mark!

53
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,997
...should I have stopped him regardless of what he said?

54
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:55,271
No Visitors?

55
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,214
Yes. I'm sorry...

56
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:02,680
I can understand him being hospitalized,
but what's this about no visitors?

57
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:06,470
Even we don't know the details...

58
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:14,712
Being worried about him here doesn't do anything.

59
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,072
Should I bring some flowers to the hospital?

60
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:33,613
Beautiful!

61
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:39,557
Dammit!

62
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:44,902
Oh... It's rare that you come to buy some flowers at my shop.

63
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,370
It's nothing... It's none of your business.

64
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:51,898
It's rare, too, that you're watching the shop.

65
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:55,482
I'm gonna quickly choose some...

66
00:07:55,483 --> 00:08:00,157
People don't like flowers with the root
because it says they'll root in the hoptial.

67
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,827
So, the base is cut off flower.

68
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,042
What are you talking about?

69
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:10,346
It's no use to play innocent! You're
going to see Sasuke-kun, aren't you?

70
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,817
Mom, I'm going out for a while!

71
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:21,963
I won't allow you to visit him alone. I'm going with you.

72
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,907
Omimai (To visit him in hospital)

73
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,284
Dammit... Ino pig!

74
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:34,670
I decided to pick this flower! One Rose of Love!

75
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:40,985
It's a no brainer. I'm choosing this one, the narcissus.

76
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:47,610
It's a brave flower that stands valiantly even in
the coldness of the winter and waits for the spring.

77
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,287
I make my wish for him to be able to leave hospital soon.

78
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,688
I see that you became a bit more knowledgeable.

79
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,991
I told you that I won't lose to you!

80
00:08:56,992 --> 00:09:00,198
Alright, alright. Then you're getting one narcissus, ok?

81
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:02,256
Ah... I'll take two.

82
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:04,729
Why? One is enough.

83
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,509
Well, one for Lee-san, too.

84
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:21,880
Another one!

85
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:23,115
Yakiniku (Korean BBQ)

86
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,027
Kalbi for 10 people!

87
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,639
How can you eat that much... I'm
feeling sick just by watching you eat.

88
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,905
Thank you for waiting.

89
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,980
Oh, it's here!

90
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,305
Those are mine. Don't eat them, Shikamaru.

91
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,679
I'm not gonna eat them.

92
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,748
What are you guys doing? Eating Yakiniku for lunch?!

93
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,624
Oh, Ino and Sakura...

94
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,021
Shikamaru, don't you need to do special
training for the final exam match?

95
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:04,906
I've been doing that every single
day. Asuma doesn't let me get away.

96
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:11,046
In fact, Choji's helping us for that special training.

97
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,755
You accepted that?

98
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:19,730
Yup. He promised me
all-I-can-eat Yakiniku, instead.

99
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:21,757
I see.

100
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:26,745
I should've not survived for the final exam match.

101
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,016
Don't talk like that.  There' a lot of
people who can't be there even they want to.

102
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:32,433
He's right!

103
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:37,498
I heard that Gai and Kurenai are doing very hard ones...

104
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,563
What?

105
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:44,579
It won't be good to be there if you
get knocked out in one second... eh?

106
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:49,567
Damn... Tiresome.

107
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:04,005
It's already above the human's limitation...

108
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,639
I guess I used up too much chakra...

109
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:09,710
Are you alright? Neji?!

110
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,100
Kuchiyose no jutsu!

111
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:56,130
Ahhh! A tadpole again?! You haven't improved even an inch!

112
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:59,529
See! It's bigger than the last time!!

113
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,912
I can't see the difference!

114
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:10,356
Konoha Hospital

115
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,875
Uchiha Sasuke-san, right?

116
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,203
You can have five minutes. I can't allow any longer than that.

117
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:21,247
He still needs to lie quietly.

118
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:22,509
Yes.

119
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,432
Sasuke-kun, visitors.

120
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,597
Two cute girls...

121
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,043
His clothes are gone!

122
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:42,213
This is not good. His body has't
recovered enough to walk around outside.

123
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,527
Doctor! Doctor!

124
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:49,366
No way.

125
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:53,966
Sasuke-kun will definetely look for me.

126
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:02,033
Sasuke-kun, where did you go?

127
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,647
I'm feeling the task to climb up the cliff this too hard...

128
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,299
man, my body is weakened...

129
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:29,756
Will I make it in time?

130
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:52,675
Kai (Open)

131
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,221
Hey.

132
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,658
You finally got here.

133
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:30,726
We're going to look for Sasuke-kun.
But if you see him, please let us know.

134
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,229
Yes.

135
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,224
And, Lee-kun right?

136
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,061
Yes

137
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:41,255
He, too, hasn't recovered enough
to move. It's going to be brief. Ok?

138
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,110
Lee-kun, visitors.

139
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,093
Two cute girls...

140
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,550
No, Lee-kun too?

141
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:58,579
Out there...

142
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,711
Sakura, let's go!

143
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:18,094
One-armed push ups 200 times. If I
can't do it, I'll do 100 one-leg squats.

144
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:29,857
Lee-kun, stop it!

145
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:32,409
Lee-kun, Stop IT!

146
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:37,909
Please don't touch me!

147
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:44,215
Please don't disturb my training!

148
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,695
I'll take two.

149
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,582
Why? One is enough.

150
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:55,250
Well, one for Lee-san, too.

151
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:04,534
Well, ah... Sakura. Did you hear about Lee-san?

152
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,428
About what?

153
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:11,567
I heard that Lee-san is seriously injured, and...

154
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:16,868
with that body he can't live as a Ninja anymore.

155
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:47,847
I'm not finished yet.

156
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,969
It's not worth it to work hard for those
who don't also believe in themselves.

157
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:26,398
one... one... one more time!

158
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:43,371
I'll bring the strecher. Please watch him.

159
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,469
Yes.

160
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,324
Ino...

161
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,045
Why do boys always push themselves to the edge?

162
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:21,116
Don't ask such question to me, I'm a girl...

163
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,859
Sorry.

164
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,632
Nikudan Sensya! (Human body Tank)

165
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:31,346
Ninpo Kagemane no.... (Shadow Copy)

166
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,387
Dammit. I don't have enough chakra!

167
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:49,322
What's up, Shikamaru? Did you already reach your limit?

168
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:52,253
How annoying...

169
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,702
Alright, Choji. One more time.

170
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:15,880
Who would that be from...?

171
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,345
This rose was wasted...

172
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:31,962
My  narcissus, too.

173
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:37,827
Ah... not fun.

174
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:44,147
Hey Naruto. No more bikini girls
around, so it's time to go back today.

175
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:48,765
Eh. We can still stay here... a
little longer.. just a little bit!

176
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:53,254
I'm hungry... I'm getting tired, too.

177
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,123
You did nothing.

178
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,544
Be grateful that I'm at least being here with you!

179
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:01,187
He's snapped!

180
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:05,035
Ok. I got it. Oiroke no
jutsu. (Sexy-no-jutsu)

181
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,586
Oh man... is that it?

182
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:24,264
What I want to do is not Oiroke
no jutsu, but Kuchiyose no jutsu!

183
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:28,216
Ok, ok. Then, show it to me.

184
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,607
Here it comes...

185
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:32,917
Kuchiyose no jutsu!

186
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:36,054
Alright!

187
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:40,824
You're dead! You've got no talent!

188
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,601
Look at it closely!

189
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,661
It's got hind legs!

190
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:53,652
You're super stupid!

191
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,506
Try summoning one with hands, legs, and ears all at once!

192
00:20:56,763 --> 00:21:00,562
Shut up! It's better than before just by having it with legs!

193
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,909
Ah, Ichiraku's ramen is tasty! If
training is like this, I can do it forever.

194
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,366
Eat! Eat up! Eat more! Becasue it's the last...

195
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:46,251
Huh? Did you say something?

196
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:48,245
Does it taste good, Naruto?

197
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:49,495
Hey, another bowl, master!

198
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:53,705
Eat up like you have nothing to regret.

199
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,977
Next Episode Dead or Alive!? Risking life for learning Jutsu!!

200
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,605
The Sennin seems to be hiding some secrets from me.
