Good bye.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,659
Tried memorizzare the transformation technique that I have taught to you today.

31
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:03,582
And not forgotten to perceive your families of the ceremony of investitura of the Fifth Hokage.

32
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,334
It goes well

33
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,005
Konohamaru!

34
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,050
Which thing is, Iruka-sensei?

35
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,179
Eheh nothing.... Tomorrow.

36
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,015
S ì!  Good bye, Iruka-sensei.

37
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,229
Me it seems that that one of a time is returned.

38
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,776
Lee!

39
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,238
Vai to the rieducazione center?

40
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:35,906
S ì.

41
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,200
I hope that it res-establish to you in a hurry.

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,662
Thanks thousands.

43
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,931
To recover all the cells in once…

44
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,309
If this were for a single part, could find one solution,

45
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,812
but I cannot make it for all in once single…

46
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,468
In order to make it short, Konoha is in difficulty.

47
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,054
We must work hard in order to replace it in sixth.

48
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,393
Lee-saint, you would have to go also to find Tsunade-sama. He will cure you of sure!

49
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,355
He forgets the vocation about Ninja, you would have to try an other road.>.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,117
Episode #100
The ties consecrate between a Master and its pupil to you

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,117
When a man loses its way of Ninja

52
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,250
Bunshin not Jutsu

53
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,008
Henge not Jutsu

54
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,265
Boy.

55
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,397
The concentration is a lot important for the training.

56
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:37,069
More you will train yourself, more you will become a great Ninja.

57
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,284
But who you are? You are cos ì  strange…

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,081
Child! You say cos ì  because six young person!

59
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,832
Later!

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,635
It was before the time that I saw Gai-sensei.

61
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:02,803
And…

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,224
Well, from this moment in then, you are of the Genin!

63
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,644
I would want to know your dreams, your plans.

64
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,401
I do not want to speak of.

65
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,945
I! I!

66
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,240
Even if I cannot use the Ninjutsu neither the Genjutsu,

67
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,535
I want to try that I can become a great Ninja!

68
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,121
E' which counts more for me!

69
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,414
That beautiful dream.

70
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,584
Tu! Which thing makes you to laugh!?

71
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,131
Not joke! Only using the Taijutsu,  I will try  that I can become a great Ninja!

72
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,761
Tu.... If you do not know to use neither the Ninjutsu neither the Genjutsu, you cannot become a Ninja.

73
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:51,226
The six only boy is not graduated to the academy having only used the Taijutsu?

74
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,188
Extraordinary what is not one.

75
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,481
It is  only an exception.

76
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,408
It is not necessarily true, if you have one great will.

77
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:17,711
If you will always try to train to you with yours avails again, you will become sure of large the Ninja.

78
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,380
But it must work hardly.

79
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,548
One great will?

80
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,345
All it is begun cos ì.

81
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,140
That  that has said to me has been  that  that it has made.

82
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,777
Six in delay! 17 minuteren and 32 second ones for the precision!

83
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,570
I do not have wants to fight today.

84
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,114
We have 48 victories everyone.

85
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,575
Who will gain this time will have won all.

86
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,373
Even if you had answered not, would not be changed nothing.

87
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,961
Stavolta is my turn in order to decide the rules of the combat, just?

88
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:07,344
A combat of Taijutsu, one run of 100 meters, a combat of sumo, or a challenge to who eats more?

89
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,720
Uh…

90
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,899
If you put it cos ì…

91
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,860
Then, what?

92
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,446
Janken.

93
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,739
[ Paper, Scissors, Pebble ]

94
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,701
Janken!? That you say…

95
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,203
They do not say that the fortune sorride to the audacious ones?

96
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:38,208
And for more it will try your glares. Task that is one good challenge.

97
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,210
Mmm but…

98
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:45,382
What? It has chosen this game because the others would have been too much difficult?

99
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,092
It would be said of .

100
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,721
I accept!  I will not lose.

101
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:55,392
If I lose,  I will go around  500 of Konoha walking on the hands!

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,061
Here an other stupid idea…

103
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,022
I promise!

104
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,151
You put it in yours objects to you.

105
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:09,114
Thoughts that can make it truly!? E' cos ì  ridicule. She seems a child…

106
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,035
Impossible! E' too much even for Gai-sensei!

107
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,287
It is not cos ì  impossible for an idiot!

108
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,420
Janken!

109
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,420
Janken!

110
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,425
You were here then.>.

111
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:31,803
Gai-sensei…

112
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,097
Why you are here?

113
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,683
I know to you better than same you.

114
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,484
Yesterday six not gone to the rieducazione center… and not even today!

115
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,540
When they have become Genin, I have revealed you my dreams.

116
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,667
In this place.

117
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,882
Later on, Neji taken game of me.

118
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,051
But I was serious.

119
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,431
Even if I cannot use a Ninjutsu neither the Genjutsu,

120
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,893
I want to try that it can become a great Ninja!

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,187
E' the more important thing for me!

122
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,899
Then you have said to me.>.

123
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,946
"If trained with yours avails again itself you will become a great Ninja."

124
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,742
"But for this it must work hardly "

125
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,455
I was cos ì  content.

126
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,584
Henge!

127
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,336
When I was to the academy.>.

128
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,007
my companions and my sensei

129
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,551
they did not have confidence in me

130
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,311
They are felt to me refused.

131
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,857
For someone like me that he does not know to make nothing, it was obvious that…

132
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,736
there was… to work hard.

133
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,460
Only an upset worker  can  stick a genius. I have always guarded this phrase in head.

134
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:32,007
Sensei, you had said to me that I could become a genius also training to me with engagement.

135
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:38,013
That same day you had said to me that I had to believe in me in order to make it us.

136
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,898
There is a probability of 50% that the operation goes to good aim

137
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,488
But…

138
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,992
This time, even if I make of my best…

139
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,080
Even if creed in me.... will not change nothing!

140
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,045
Gai-sensei, you say something ve of it I pray!

141
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,553
You say to me,  I will become  like you, Gai-sensei?

142
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,265
Why they are the solo to suffer a lot!?

143
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:26,353
I will try  to us, even if I must die. I want protect my dreams!

144
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,438
Because it is my Ninja creed.

145
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,359
Which thing I must make!?

146
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:37,364
Hachi not Tonko, in order to exceed the limits of the body.  It is  a Kinjutsu?

147
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,950
You say something!

148
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,829
They are ready to run this risk. I want to learn this Kinjutsu!

149
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,622
I will make  all in order to lead my dream a.termine!

150
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,920
E'  that  that it more counts for me…

151
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,810
Only using the Taijutsu, you have covered one long road in order to become a great Ninja.

152
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,480
It was your objective and us six successful one alone.

153
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:19,448
It must be a indescrivibile pain to see that after all these efforts the destiny has tried to remove your dreams to you.

154
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:26,038
Any are its dreams, would make better to forget the vocation than Ninja.

155
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,626
Lee.

156
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:40,093
If you want to give a term to this suffering, you must face one challenge!

157
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,560
It is worth to say to have to forget my dreams?

158
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,690
If you abandon your dreams, of it you will suffer only more.

159
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:59,238
If it is not possible to cover the way of the Ninja, it does not have more sense.... seems stupid but it is cos ì.

160
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,823
Valid E' for you, but it is also for me.

161
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,788
Chip ax the operation, Lee!

162
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,769
How it goes? I speak about your study on regeneration.

163
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,064
The problem is the Chakra.

164
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,944
To arrange it with the cells, the skin, the organs, muscles. This truly is complicated.

165
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,740
To recover all at once is only much difficult one.

166
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,785
To recover in a blow?

167
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,496
You take game of me?

168
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,248
Not!

169
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,585
Creed in you.

170
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,356
I do not know because, but me memory of the time where you and Kakashi-sensei,

171
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,859
You have defied yourselves to Janken.

172
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,781
That day you said that the fortune was with you.

173
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,074
The operation…

174
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:31,872
That it survives or not.... To win or to lose…

175
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,084
Completely various E' from the Janken!

176
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,966
Memories what succeeded to you after, Lee?

177
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,937
500  turns, like promised.

178
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,468
Merda!

179
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:36,311
If I lose  I will go around  500 of Konoha walking on the hands!

180
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:37,855
I promise!

181
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,527
Thoughts that can make it truly!? E' cos ì  ridicule. She seems a child…

182
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,291
It is not nothing…

183
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,053
Which thing is, Lee?

184
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,435
Why the fairies? Kakashi-sensei if of frega.And nobody is watching.

185
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,064
If I have promised one what, even if I can seem to you infantile,

186
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,151
I maintain to cost of my life!

187
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,530
I promise!

188
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,160
Which thing?

189
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:39,166
Why before making any thing invented always these stupid rules?

190
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:49,343
It is  one beautiful question, Lee. a Six good observer.

191
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:54,056
Well. But not to say it to nobody.  It is  a secret.

192
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,432
Which thing?

193
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,145
It is  a type of training that leads the Victoria.

194
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,730
Car-objective is called!

195
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,193
Car-objective?

196
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,319
It listens…

197
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:16,328
When chip ax a challenge, must fix a objective in order to succeed to exceed it

198
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:22,042
As an example, behind the phrase "If I lose to the Janken,  I will go around  500", the objective is to increase my power

199
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:29,758
An able power to stick Kakashi making simply 500 turns.

200
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,260
Clearly.

201
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:40,936
Consequently, fixing my objective to
500  turns, I can be struck seriously to the Janken.

202
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,355
It is  the first advantage.

203
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:51,029
Then, if I lose, I go around 500,
therefore I train myself with assiduousness.

204
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,115
The combination of these two things gives "the extreme preparation to two levels "

205
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,909
I have understood!

206
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,288
Well, I continue.

207
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,914
I  will make also!

208
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,916
My objective will be…

209
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,752
Ehi. Ehi, Lee! Be reasonable, Lee.

210
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,714
If I cannot be maintained to your level…

211
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,301
Then  I will work  still harder!

212
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:20,475
If I take example from you and hard job, I could become a great Ninja.

213
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,607
Well. I go to add qualche.cosa to mine objects to you to catch up…

214
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,403
If you do not succeed to resist until the end with me,

215
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,948
I will dedicate  my life to your training.

216
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:41,330
If I dedicate my life to your training, you will be able to become a great Ninja!

217
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,123
You I promise.

218
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,216
It was happened cos ì.

219
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:56,637
That one was when you had taught the system to me of the cars objects to you…

220
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,143
You have always worked with engagement. The operation will succeed.

221
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,189
And a better future will carry you!

222
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,819
If per.disgrazia the operation will fail…

223
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,490
I  morirò  with you.

224
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:29,586
From when I know to you my objective has been
to make so that you become a great Ninja.

225
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:32,756
You I promise.

226
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:41,682
If we cannot more follow our way of Ninja.... patience.

227
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,518
It is worth for all and two.

228
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,358
Gai-sensei!

229
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,163
Well, we go, Lee!

230
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,540
S ì.

231
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,061
Tsunade-sama.

232
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,463
Beginning from today,  I will be  the carrying column of this village!

233
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,965
I am the Fifth Hokage!

234
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:20,113
The Believe your promised. It' s too hard to give me courage…

235
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:24,409
