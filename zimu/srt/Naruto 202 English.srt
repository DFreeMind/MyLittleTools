1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,617
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,453
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:12,555
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:29,013
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:34,451
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,147
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:40,658
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:45,186
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:51,826
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,866
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:02,312
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,716
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,880
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:19,694
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,153
All right, thanks for waiting!

16
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:52,154
"The Special Presentation Today!"

17
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,926
"The Top 5 Famous
Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,231
"There Are Also Fun Extras"
has finally started!

19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,600
Isn't this exciting, Sakura?!

20
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,764
Yes, from the next episode,

21
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,004
"Naruto" which you've all
been supporting

22
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,011
for the past four years
will enter its fifth year.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,447
And so today,
we're changing our plans

24
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:14,781
to present you with
famous battle scenes

25
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,254
in the order determined by
votes from the guys in the Leaf!

26
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,923
Is that favorite battle you want
to see again included?

27
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:24,125
We've also invited
some special guests,

28
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:26,061
so don't miss it!

29
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,956
Then, we'll be moving on ahead.

30
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,594
First, check out fifth and
fourth place back to back!

31
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:40,470
FIFTH PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~

32
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,703
All right, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

33
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,438
Just what you'd expect of me,
the hero!

34
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,310
To think I'd appear right at the start.

35
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:49,147
I've shrewdly got everyone's hearts!

36
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,912
You're right!

37
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,078
To be honest,

38
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:55,854
the coolness of Sasuke in motion
is unfathomable.

39
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,086
Outstanding destructive power.
Cha!

40
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,695
Umm, Sakura?

41
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,366
Our comments aren't meshing
right off the bat.

42
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,959
Just keep quiet!

43
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,137
Right.

44
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,204
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

45
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,544
Attack and defense with
no time to breathe.

46
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:24,213
This is gripping.

47
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,184
Throw in a kick there!

48
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:32,163
Give him a beat down and thrash up!

49
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:38,467
Umm, Sakura. How about
a little support for the hero there...?

50
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,525
Shut up, Naruto!

51
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,542
Naruto Barrage!

52
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,942
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

53
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,352
<i>Wh What's that Jutsu?!</i>

54
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:08,933
You jerk!

55
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:11,535
Chidori!

56
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,838
Stop it... you two...

57
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,172
Stop it!

58
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,446
That's mean to punch me all
of a sudden, Sakura!

59
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,057
I couldn't help it.
I got excited.

60
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:38,019
FOURTH PLACE
CHOJI VS. JIROBO
~FATSO VS. FATSO~
Now, let's collect ourselves
and check out fourth place next!

61
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,661
It's too late whatever you do now!

62
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,400
Crushing Palm!

63
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:51,234
Man, this battle moves me to tears,
no matter how often I watch it.

64
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,334
That's right! As it happens,

65
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,845
I sat down on my knees in front of
the TV while blowing my nose.

66
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,511
It invoked tears in the living rooms
in the Land of Fire for sure.

67
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:04,248
Yeah, yeah... I really thought
Choji had died in this episode.

68
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:05,480
That's for sure.

69
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:09,123
I was also totally fooled
by the producers.

70
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,488
<i>Wh What's that... ?

71
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,120
But...

72
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,763
Boulder Blow!

73
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,304
It's futile!

74
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,635
I'm a hundred times stronger
than before!

75
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,579
They say a grudge over food
is ferocious, right?

76
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,353
That one punch just now

77
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:42,086
was the grudge for you eating
the last bite of the snack.

78
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:47,354
<i>No way! He's got so much Chakra</i>
<i>his build has changed!</i>

79
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,363
And this is...

80
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,165
This is for insulting me by calling me
a sacrificial piece and fat!

81
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:04,173
But what's most unforgivable is
you insulting my best friend!

82
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:11,185
That's more unforgivable than
swiping the last bite of gourmet food

83
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:16,626
or insulting me by calling me fat!

84
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,466
<i>All my Chakra...</i>
<i>to my left hand!</i>

85
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,499
<i>O Oh, no...!</i>

86
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,600
This one punch is heavier than life!

87
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,007
W Wait...!
Don't be hasty...!

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,653
But seeing it again,
visually it's just fatso versus fatso.

89
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:50,656
No appealing parts at all
and the screen is stifling.

90
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,024
I mean, no way would I want
to see this during the summer

91
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,462
Excuse me for being stifling.

92
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,568
Yikes! Choji.

93
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,736
How long were you there?

94
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:02,170
I heard my famous battle made it
into the top five, you see...

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,207
Oh wait, Choji.

96
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,866
- You'll understand once I tell you!
- Calm down!

97
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,968
Human Boulder!

98
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:16,946
I won!

99
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,589
<i>I actually...won!</i>

100
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:27,692
We had a bit of an incident here,

101
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:29,699
but let's not worry about that
and move on.

102
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:33,102
Now before we present
third to first place,

103
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,834
we'll show the famous battles
left out of the top five.

104
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,969
Is the famous battle
you chose included?

105
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,504
Now then, here we go!

106
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,546
EXTRA SEGMENT
UNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES

107
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:47,011
KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA
~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~

108
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:48,519
-Rooster!
-Rooster!

109
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,651
- Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
- Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!

110
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,949
Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei's
Sharingan is super unfair!

111
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,061
Just what you'd expect from a Jonin.

112
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,101
KAKASHI VS. GAI
~ROCK PAPER SCISSORS~

113
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:14,778
- What?!
- You're late!

114
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,177
- This is a famous battle?!
- You're seventeen minutes

115
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,373
- Well, it's cool to have stuff like this
- and thirty two seconds late!

116
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,313
- Included once in a while, right?
- Let's forget about today...

117
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,408
We both have forty eight wins!

118
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,077
One of us will move ahead
with this battle!

119
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,620
It seems it won't work
even if I say no...

120
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,257
This time it's my turn to determine
the battle category...

121
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,826
What will it be?
A Taijutsu fight?

122
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,003
A 100 meter dash?

123
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,472
Skin diving? I wouldn't mind
an eating contest...

124
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,275
Listen, you...

125
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:46,267
Well then...

126
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,239
Wh What?!

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,247
Rock-paper-scissors!

128
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,214
I accept the challenge.
No way will I lose!

129
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,079
If I lose, I'll do five hundred laps

130
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,179
around the Leaf Village
standing on my head!

131
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,754
Absurdity again...

132
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:01,559
It's a promise!

133
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,627
Here we go again...
His favorite own rules.

134
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,096
Okay, everyone together now.

135
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,001
-Rock-paper...
-Rock-paper...

136
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,306
Scissors!

137
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,373
After the commercial,
we'll present third to first place.

138
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,678
Don't miss it.

139
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,044
Now at last for the presentation
of third to first place.

140
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,750
First up is third place!

141
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,515
Now then, which battle has worked
its way up to the higher ranks?

142
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:39,454
Here we go! T he appearance of
the famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!

143
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,656
- Heh!
- <i>Damn it...</i>

144
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:41,994
- It's the appearance of
- <i>Is it all over... ?

145
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,966
A team that's just loud.

146
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,499
What?!
You're saying to do that?!

147
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,040
No, Akamaru!

148
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,436
It's too dangerous to do that
without any comrades around!

149
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:55,201
You understand that, don't you?!

150
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,281
We'll die like dogs here if we miss...

151
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:01,452
Ow!

152
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:05,889
Akamaru...

153
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:17,466
<i>To think I'd get bitten by you.</i>
<i>I'm a pathetic owner...</i>

154
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:24,106
<i>Okay, Akamaru...</i>
<i>As you say, we just have to do that...</i>

155
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,344
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

156
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,558
Now, Akamaru!

157
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,527
What?!

158
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:45,959
<i>Show him the fruits of our training!</i>

159
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,023
<i>Dynamic Marking!</i>

160
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,095
That's a dirty trick!

161
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:53,634
<i>Now we're ready!</i>

162
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,034
<i>Inuzuka Style! Man Beast</i>
<i>Transformation Combo!</i>

163
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,816
<i>Two Headed Wolf!</i>

164
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:14,658
Eat this!

165
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:22,328
Sakon, what're you doing! To the right!

166
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,667
Uh oh...!

167
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:25,226
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

168
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,300
Though he sometimes bites
his owner's hand,

169
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:30,341
he presses for a decision.

170
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:34,639
It seems Akamaru's stock shot up
in the Leaf after this.

171
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,573
What a man!

172
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:42,711
Man, my butt! Just a puppy
whose evil eyes got worse!

173
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:45,414
Who has evil eyes?!

174
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,382
Yikes, Kiba!

175
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,859
H-How long were you there?

176
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,318
Knock it off!

177
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,226
Here I was invited as a guest

178
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,822
with my battle
having been ranked high.

179
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,924
What's the deal of
finishing in third place

180
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,799
on top of being told mean things?!

181
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,737
It's Kiba and Akamaru
who finished in third.

182
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,334
Please face the camera

183
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:09,403
and say a few words to everyone
in their living rooms.

184
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:13,778
Oh, umm, thanks for your support.

185
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:16,012
Well, we came in third this time.

186
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:20,790
But we'll kick the butts of some enemies,

187
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,258
so please look forward
to our success!

188
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,854
Considering you're talking
all big or whatever,

189
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:29,491
didn't you have a rough time
with it after this?

190
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,825
The best is yet to come,
I tell you!

191
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,737
That's the last straw.
Get him, Akamaru!

192
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,007
Now for the presentation
of second place.

193
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,014
<i>He's like a completely different person...</i>

194
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,757
<i>His Chakra activity is overwhelming...</i>

195
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,528
<i>And those markings...</i>

196
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:09,901
<i>The movements earlier...</i>

197
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,541
<i>He dodged the attack from behind</i>

198
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,908
<i>and saw me hiding in the shadows...</i>

199
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:21,015
<i>In other words, he's combining</i>
<i>wide vision and x ray vision.</i>

200
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,517
<i>And in addition, that Jutsu...</i>

201
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:26,590
<i>Then...</i>

202
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:32,492
Summoning Jutsu!

203
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:46,300
I'll find a perfect...
way to attack that power of yours.

204
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:56,680
<i>If he defends physical attacks</i>
<i>with rotation</i>

205
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,382
<i>and a large emission of Chakra...</i>

206
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,483
<i>then I should stop that Chakra rotation!</i>

207
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,759
- This is the second place battle?
- Scatter!

208
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,096
That's right! It's a battle of brains while
assessing the opponent's weak point!

209
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,893
Hmm. But as for me...

210
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,831
I'm not a big fan of sluggish battles!

211
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,806
- Oh, why?
- Hmm.

212
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:18,899
How can I put it?
If you're talking about battle

213
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:22,912
I want to see a collision of fist
on fist, and body on body.

214
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,949
Oh, but a Ninja isn't just
about Taijutsu.

215
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,918
Oh. That's being rude to Bushy Brow.

216
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:29,953
Oh, sorry.

217
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,886
I mean, yeah, I want to see

218
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,015
something fiery, like Bushy Brow!

219
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,689
There just isn't anything fiery
in Neji's battles.

220
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,096
Here!

221
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,562
He's argumentative or something.

222
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,133
Unexciting or something.

223
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,692
I'd like him to just take on the enemy
without regard to appearances!

224
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:51,404
Heh! Missions with you are
a chore because you think like that.

225
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,409
Yikes, Neji!

226
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:58,112
Now then, a few words from
the second place Neji.

227
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,711
Humph! How silly.

228
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,618
You're free to evaluate my battles,
but it's unthinkable

229
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,715
for me to be forced to appear
in a place like this.

230
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:11,853
Heh! You're sure making
an exhibition of yourself, considering!

231
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:15,157
Oh! Could it be you're after
an appearance fee?!

232
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,795
Too bad.

233
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,994
This is a program for everyone
in their living rooms,

234
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,267
so we asked you to do this for free!

235
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:28,070
No problem.
I asked the Fifth Hokage

236
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,703
and she's treating this appearance
as a mission.

237
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,542
Since it's a mission,
I have no choice but to appear.

238
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,214
And of course, a mission fee
will be incurred.

239
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,749
Whoa, always the realist.

240
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,257
Neji, it's not fair that
you get paid for this!

241
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:46,325
My brain is built differently than yours!

242
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,300
Gentle Fist!

243
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:57,139
It seems the ranking board is busted,

244
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,438
so we'll go right on ahead
and present first place.

245
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:02,435
Which battle has finished in first?

246
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:08,752
Chidori!

247
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:11,778
Oh ho! Sure enough, it's pointless

248
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:15,121
if the number one battle
isn't one of my battles!

249
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,183
That's right!
This is the battle that

250
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,092
anyone would
acknowledge as number one.

251
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:21,791
<i>Rasengan!</i>

252
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:51,261
- Rasengan!
- Chidori!

253
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:36,002
And so, did you all guess right?

254
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,206
The glorious best battle has been
determined to be "Sasuke's Battle!"

255
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:45,038
Hey, hey, Sakura.
It's the "Battle in the Final Valley"!

256
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,144
FIRST PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~FINAL VALLEY~
What? Was it?

257
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,780
Forget it.

258
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:53,381
Well, let's collect ourselves
and check out

259
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:58,588
some special footage of myself,
who came in a glorious first place!

260
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,357
Y You... idiot!

261
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,533
Hold it!
What's up with this recording?!

262
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:08,136
- This is different from what I prepared!
- What're you doing?!

263
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:10,537
- No, no, don't watch!
- Don't be peeping!

264
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:13,600
I demand a do over as the hero!

265
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,736
Someone not involved is
making a ruckus.

266
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,648
And now, thanks for waiting!

267
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,744
Now for the appearance of
a special guest.

268
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:25,221
Let's go live to the site.
Master Jiraiya!

269
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,256
What? What?

270
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,381
Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?

271
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:31,057
<i>Yes... Loud and clear.</i>

272
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,254
What?

273
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:35,230
Master Jiraiya,
where are you right now?

274
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:38,435
<i>Mm, I'm in kind of a dubious place.</i>

275
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,466
<i>I hope you'll excuse me from</i>
<i>divulging my location.</i>

276
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,336
<i>Well, if I have to say something,</i>

277
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,103
<i>I'd say I'm in a certain person's</i>
<i>hideout, I guess.</i>

278
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,569
Hey! Pervy Sage!
What're you doing there?!

279
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,545
What happened to you
watching my training?!

280
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,085
<i>Now, now.</i>
<i>Today's a special program,</i>

281
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:58,348
<i>so don't be such a stick in the mud.</i>

282
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,549
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>I've met up with someone special...</i>

283
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,824
<i>None other than Orochimaru.</i>

284
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:05,896
What?!

285
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,324
Sakura...
What the hell is this...?!

286
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:13,000
It sure has been a long time,
Orochimaru!

287
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,069
<i>Oh, same here...</i>

288
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,572
<i>Here you could have invited me</i>
<i>to the studio.</i>

289
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,768
Who would invite the likes of you?!

290
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,519
<i>Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu</i>
<i>and conducting experiments.</i>

291
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,255
<i>And more importantly,</i>
<i>I need him to get stronger quickly, so.</i>

292
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,118
- If he's there, bring him out!
- What...?!

293
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:45,128
<i>Actually, I tried talking him into it</i>
<i>many times saying today's special...</i>

294
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,533
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>he didn't give me a good answer.</i>

295
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,171
- I see...
- <i>Hey.</i>

296
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,209
What?!

297
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,073
<i>Are you going to go</i>
<i>on and on forever?</i>

298
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:58,512
<i>If you've got that kind of time,</i>
<i>then continue the training, Orochimaru.</i>

299
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,676
S Sasuke...

300
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,980
Sasuke...
Is that you, Sasuke?!

301
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:08,882
<i>I'll be going on ahead to the dojo.</i>
<i>Get a move on.</i>

302
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:10,450
Oh, wait...!

303
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:14,357
<i>Oh, it seems I've angered Sasuke.</i>

304
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,266
<i>I shall also be leaving now.</i>

305
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,566
Wait! Orochimaru!
Put Sasuke on one more time...

306
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,934
Sakura...
He can't hear you anymore.

307
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:25,667
I know...

308
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:30,275
- Sakura...
- Yeah. Right!

309
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:31,748
That's right!

310
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,973
Now then,
it's about time to say goodbye.

311
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,817
Did you all enjoy our special:

312
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,879
"The Special Presentation Today!"

313
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,619
The Top 5 Famous
Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!

314
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,059
There Are Also Fun Extras"?

315
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,298
Hey, what're you wrapping things
up on your own for?

316
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,024
What about my do over
special footage?

317
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:52,599
You're annoying.

318
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:54,966
We don't have any time left,
so wrap things up now!

319
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:58,742
What?! Fine!

320
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,706
Unfortunately, my special footage will
have to wait for the next time.

321
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,010
But everyone in the village,
including me,

322
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,812
will keep showing
awesome fights one after another!

323
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,978
Everyone, please continue to support us...

324
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:11,988
- and keep watching "Naruto"!
- And keep watching "Naruto"!

325
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:15,119
SEE YOU LATER
- See you later!
- See you later!

326
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:43,217
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

327
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:45,721
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

328
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:50,226
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

329
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,356
<i>Suggestively</i>

330
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:58,163
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

331
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:04,774
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

332
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:11,338
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

333
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:16,375
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

334
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:21,550
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

335
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:53,054
I never thought that
you were so stubborn!

336
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,091
Even if you make a fuss,
nothing's going to change.

337
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,650
But, at this rate,
she's going to abandon us.

338
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:59,161
It's her choice.
There's nothing we can do.

339
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,129
Hey, Hinata!
What do you think?

340
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,995
We still don't know
what her situation is...

341
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,432
Does that mean that you're with Shino?!

342
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,468
