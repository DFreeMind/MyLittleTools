1
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:21,645
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:26,454
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,086
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,687
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,293
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:46,210
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:55,581
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:06,363
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:15,840
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,970
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,186
Is this really Moso's house?

12
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,656
Here he's a superintendant officer,

13
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,993
so I thought it'd be a more luxurious
building with gold folding screens.

14
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,496
Your voices are too loud.

15
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:20,263
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
with no self-interests.

16
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,503
So he lives frugally.

17
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,806
But you know, he's an old man

18
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,212
who's the second most important guy
in the land next to the feudal lord, right?

19
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,246
He smacks of being really poor.

20
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,113
Naruto!

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,558
Well well, how shameful of me
to present such a poor residence.

22
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,396
Lord Moso.

23
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,067
What?!

24
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,233
This old man like from
some dumpling shop?

25
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,568
I'm an old man from
a dumpling shop?

26
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,775
Geez, unbelievable!

27
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,508
Idiot!

28
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,141
What're you doing, Neji?!

29
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,047
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

30
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:14,056
So you are Ninja who came from
the Village Hidden in Leaves?

31
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:19,030
From the right,
this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.

32
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,630
I hear you encountered
the Cursed Warrior that appeared

33
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,263
in Lord Komei's residence last night.

34
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,731
Yes.

35
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,404
So, how did it go?

36
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,303
Did you figure out the true identity
of the Cursed Warrior?

37
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,340
Yeah, it's a real ghost.

38
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,580
Oh, a ghost, huh?

39
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,252
Don't be jumping to conclusions
on your own.

40
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,617
But he appears all of a sudden
and flies around.

41
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,558
Yeah, and on top of that,
the inside of his armor was empty.

42
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,558
No matter how bizarre the thing,
there's always a trick.

43
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,161
I'll pin down the true identity without fail.

44
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,729
That is encouraging...

45
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,198
We have just changed feudal lords
and the public is still anxious.

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,104
Please eliminate the rumors of
the Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.

47
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,306
I beg of you.

48
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,951
Please!

49
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,618
Tsurucho Yakitori

50
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,451
Here are your chicken wings.

51
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,220
Oh, here we go!

52
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,523
They look tasty!

53
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,427
Hot!

54
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,396
That Moso superintendant officer
seems like a good guy.

55
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,103
Yes. It was also Lord Moso
who came to my rescue

56
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,234
and selected me to be a page.

57
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,906
The son of the feudal lord succeeds him

58
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,909
and an excellent superintendant officer
offers him tutelage...

59
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,075
The government appears
to be stable, but...

60
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,222
Then why is there a strange rumor
going around

61
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,383
about the haunting
of the previous feudal lord?

62
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,760
There's probably somebody displeased

63
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,819
with this dramatic replacement
of the feudal lord.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,491
Do you have any idea who it might be?

65
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,230
Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.

66
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,932
Isn't that the name of
the tactician you were talking about

67
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,705
who wanted to become the feudal lord?

68
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,948
Then why did the Cursed Warrior
appear in his residence?

69
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,977
Perhaps to deflect attention.

70
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,453
That's it.
I bet that's it.

71
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,489
All right, since it's come to this,

72
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:29,016
if we can nab that old man
called Komei or whatever

73
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,926
and quickly get him to own up...

74
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,989
Guys, let's get fired up and
get going!

75
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,361
Idiot. We can't do something
like that without proof.

76
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,930
He is a tactician of this land
more or less, so.

77
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,338
Oh man, that's no fun.

78
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,871
First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord.

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,978
That's not possible. Lord Sagi
does not like to meet anybody.

80
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,048
Don't be such a stick-in -the-mud.
Let us meet him, okay?

81
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,717
You're a "nipple" friend, right?

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,294
If you're going to say that,
say, "childhood friend."

83
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,124
Huh?

84
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,108
Can we really meet him
in a place like this?

85
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,610
This lake holds fond memories
for Lord Sagi.

86
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,117
And... for me as well.

87
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,122
In our young days,

88
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:39,324
Lord Sagi always played with
his little sister Lady Toki here.

89
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,271
He might come here around about today
with his attendants...

90
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,069
If we're lucky.

91
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,507
It's up to luck, huh?

92
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,655
It's Lord Sagi.

93
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,048
Lord Sagi, we have arrived.

94
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,747
Thank you.

95
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,259
Oh wow...
So that's Lord Sagi, huh?

96
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,559
He's cute. He is kind of my liking...

97
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,747
My watch has remained stopped
since that time.

98
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,191
Hey, what's he doing?

99
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,853
He's probably reminiscing.

100
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,534
The only thing that can comfort
Lord Sagi's heart

101
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,332
is his memories with Lady Toki.

102
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,241
<i>Byakugan.</i>

103
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,612
<i>Where is it?</i>

104
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,879
<i>Where's this bloodthirsty aura</i>
<i>coming from?</i>

105
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,443
<i>It's not above ground?</i>

106
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,455
Could it be, underwater...?

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,530
Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!

108
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,807
I don't think so!

109
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,922
Who the heck are you guys?

110
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,696
Damn it!
I won't let you get away.

111
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,261
Wait, Naruto!

112
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,500
What is it?

113
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,642
A letter bomb in the water.

114
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,481
That was a close one.

115
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,722
If you'd chased after them as is,
you would've been totally entangled.

116
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,296
Settle down.

117
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,031
Lord Sagi!

118
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,658
Are you all right?!

119
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,863
Yes, I'm fine.

120
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,302
Thank goodness!

121
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,370
Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja
from the Village Hidden in Leaves...

122
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,448
They came to investigate
the true identity of the Cursed Warrior.

123
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,752
That was unnecessary.
I bet it was that Moso's idea?

124
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,988
It was all because
he was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.

125
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,956
The fact is, if these people
were not here now...

126
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,219
Silence.

127
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,693
Y Yes, my lord.

128
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,663
Hey hey, do you really not get
how this guy feels?!

129
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,966
Chishima was seriously
worried about you.

130
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,440
Without his passionate friendship,

131
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,809
the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn't have
taken action with that low commission fee.

132
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,814
I am not obliged.

133
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,211
How bothersome!

134
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,716
Say what?!

135
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,448
Friendship is in the past.

136
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,389
I became a feudal lord and
he is a mere page.

137
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,994
We are now standing on
different surfaces.

138
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:11,201
Say that again! I'll slug the guy
who tramples on friendship!

139
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,532
Let it go, Naruto.

140
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,835
What're you doing?! Let go of me!

141
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,536
I have to give guys like this
a good thumping!

142
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,407
You are talking about a feudal lord!

143
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,817
It would have been better
had it pierced my throat.

144
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:31,819
Go.

145
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,550
Yes, my lord.

146
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,229
Jeez, who does he think he is?!

147
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,428
Jeez, a feudal lord.

148
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,706
Please forgive him.

149
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,604
What? You don't have a problem
with being told off like that?!

150
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,937
He wasn't like that in the old days.

151
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,382
His father and little sister
died in succession

152
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,852
and he became cold hearted.

153
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,051
So that's what it was.

154
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,185
I'm sure the day will come

155
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,591
when he will turn back into
the kind -hearted Lord Sagi.

156
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,855
I don't know about that.

157
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188
The Shuriken from before.

158
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,097
This is an odd shape.

159
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,870
Hm? Let me have a look.

160
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:19,865
Oh!

161
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,632
Does it look familiar to you
or something?

162
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,806
Y Yes. There are no Ninja
in the Land of Birds.

163
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,606
But there are guardsmen
receiving special training.

164
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,250
Is it a weapon those people use?

165
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,308
Yes.

166
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,451
Who commands those guardsmen?

167
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,413
The person who organizes them
is Lord Komei the tactician.

168
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,950
Say what?!

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,460
Komei again.

170
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,503
Komei must have originally thought to
mislead the public with the Cursed Warrior

171
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,641
and attempted to create
a rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.

172
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,011
But the relationship between
the two is tight.

173
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,822
And by Moso summoning us here,
he probably sensed that the day

174
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,690
was approaching when the truth
behind the incident would be revealed

175
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,456
and he plotted
to assassinate Lord Sagi.

176
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,627
If we've figured out that much,
let's charge on in!

177
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,198
Hold your horses, Naruto.

178
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,730
We have to find more hard evidence.

179
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,172
Hey, is that how it is?

180
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,844
Yeah, that's how it is.

181
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,311
Neji, look at that.

182
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,987
No doubt, it's Komei!

183
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,559
To think he'd go out without attendants

184
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,757
even though the Cursed Warrior
might appear.

185
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,523
All right, let's follow him.

186
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,752
This is the temple where
the Cursed Warrior appeared last night.

187
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,261
Something smells fishy.

188
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,186
He's shown up...!

189
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:03,731
Byakugan.

190
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,136
What's this?!

191
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,332
There's no need to waver anymore!

192
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,345
Hey! Wait.

193
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,910
I've witnessed the true identity
of the ghost!

194
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,152
Who's there?

195
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,650
Hey hey, Komei!

196
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,716
You're the one responsible
for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?

197
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,526
What?

198
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,865
H-Hold it!

199
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,569
Naruto, get down!

200
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,621
I did it!

201
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,625
Damn it! No good.

202
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,763
This thing's not just a ghost, after all.

203
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,380
A tornado?

204
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,059
I can't see the Cursed Warrior!

205
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:42,896
Byakugan.

206
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,006
A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!

207
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,378
8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!

208
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,651
What're you letting your mind drift for?!

209
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,627
Sorry... I never thought a ghost could
use Ninjutsu.

210
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,623
It's not a ghost inside the armor.
It's a Shinobi.

211
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,894
And quite a wily one at that.

212
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,805
This is the same shape
as the shuriken from this afternoon.

213
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,612
He's an important witness.
Take him alive.

214
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,342
Leave it to me!

215
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,456
But we can't take him alive

216
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,119
if we don't do something about
that tornado.

217
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:43,627
Naruto.

218
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm counting on you!

219
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,895
Right. I'll try!

220
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,305
Tenten, use as many weapons
as possible and draw his attention.

221
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,904
Roger.

222
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,154
No good. No effect at all.

223
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,818
That's fine. Just keep at it.

224
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,576
Neji... now!

225
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,116
Gentle Fist Technique,
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.

226
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,059
8 Trigrams 2 Palms.

227
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,723
4 Palms.

228
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,522
8 Palms.

229
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,864
16 Palms.

230
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,292
32 Palms.

231
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,661
64 Palms.

232
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,675
All right, we did it!

233
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,973
We'll find out the true identity
for sure this time.

234
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,983
Show us your real face.

235
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,360
What's this?

236
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,143
It's empty again.

237
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,373
This can't be!

238
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,523
Lord Komei, we have seized from
a storeroom in your residence,

239
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,465
one suit of white armor along
with guardsmen Shuriken.

240
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,437
We would like you to report
to the magistrate's office

241
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,975
as a material witness in
the recent Cursed Warrior incident

242
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,173
as well as the attempted assassination
of Lord Sagi.

243
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,884
I have no choice.

244
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,430
Thank you very much.

245
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,629
With this, Lord Sagi's heart should
settle down somewhat.

246
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,368
Case closed.

247
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,439
Still, they were sure prepared.

248
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,306
Here an hour has barely passed
since contacting Moso.

249
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,846
At that time...

250
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:51,710
- Huh?
- Huh?

251
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,646
There was a human presence
in tonight's Cursed Warrior.

252
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,713
The presence of someone alive.

253
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,989
A presence?

254
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,652
But you said you didn't feel such
a presence in the first Cursed Warrior.

255
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,159
Yeah.

256
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,692
Hey, what does that mean?

257
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,229
In other words, the two Cursed Warrior
are separate beings.

258
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:41,192
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

259
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:52,770
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

260
00:21:53,512 --> 00:22:04,081
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

261
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:16,266
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

262
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:27,710
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

263
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:39,255
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

264
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:45,019
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

265
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,295
How can we go back to the village
when there's all this mystery?

266
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,005
If we're gonna investigate,
this has to be it.

267
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,672
What? Could this black thing be...?

268
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:07,914
I get it! We use this
to get through the dark...

269
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,314
Hey, why did we end up
in a place like this?!

270
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,352
Next: "Too Late for Help
