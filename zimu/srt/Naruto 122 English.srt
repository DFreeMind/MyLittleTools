Merda.

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,942
Six sure good one.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,488
You have broken the trees and attacked
with perfect tempismo.

23
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,283
You must have made much practical one.

24
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,703
Complicated song seems to be one.

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,169
You have understood that I succeeded in
to control them with my song.

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,132
Far from negligible for a bastard dirt like
you to pick the complexity of the melodia.

27
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,012
But it is impossible that you can
to understand it completely.

28
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:23,018
The art does not appeal to to me for nothing.

29
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,814
But, if it succeeds to control them with those flauto,

30
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,152
it must it are to us something in the song
that it controls their single actions.

31
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,489
It must it are to us some structure under.

32
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,868
Confido in my abilities of observation.

33
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,037
But stavolta the things seem to put themselves badly.

34
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:48,710
I do not know null on the manipulation
of the sound and its he aims weak people.

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:55,133
Episode #122
Fake!Shikamaru is entrusted to
resurrezione of the dead men.

36
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,561
Now, I will show  you  one my specialty, Tsubaki not never.

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,896
I will make   pieces!

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,527
You would not have to make promised that you cannot maintain.

39
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,487
Hush!

40
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,670
What ?

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,133
You I have said.

42
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,261
The boneses are dense as the steel.

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,394
It would be better if you tried than person

44
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,220
Eternal damnation!

45
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,193
Nobody is not never survivor
after to have felt this melodia.

46
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,537
Supreme Melodia n°9 - Lair of the demon

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,803
Music is changed!

48
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,932
They arrive!

49
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,322
What is those…

50
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,255
What ?

51
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,516
These things are…

52
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,903
It has understood the dangerousness of the ghosts
and it has been withdrawn endured.

53
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,197
It is not cos ì  badly.

54
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,657
But....

55
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:20,797
To hide is the thing better hour,
given the insufficient amount of I exploded to you
and smoke-producing that me is remained.

56
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,009
Those things white women…

57
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,222
Hanno divorato my spiritual energy.

58
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,983
Observing the passage of mine shuriken

59
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,070
I have noticed that nutrono of chakra.

60
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,700
They are composed from chakra
and spiritual energy,

61
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,579
They have need of stability, and they are
it starves you of psychical energy.

62
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:58,252
Continuing in this way not
I will more succeed  to paste the chakra.

63
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,129
They are truly dangerous.

64
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,968
It is similar to me.
One specialist in the use of the chakra.

65
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,220
Without doubt technical secret is one.

66
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,643
Therefore I do not have to go against those
transactions white men, but against who command them.>.

67
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,606
The simpler thing would be
to stop the sound of the flauto, but…

68
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:24,444
But in these conditions,
it is impossible to approach itself.

69
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:31,493
An other possibility is to capture them
using the Kagemane not jutsu.

70
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,748
But he is not simple why they continue
to attack in accidental way.

71
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,713
If of it you lacked one, me
they would attack and would be the end.

72
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,301
Its defense and its attack
they do not have points weak people.

73
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,929
It would be an optimal giocatrice of chess.

74
00:07:54,266 --> 00:08:02,232
12 kunai remain me, 9 shuriken, 1 bomb
flash, 12 meters of cable and 1 I seal explosive.

75
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:09,072
Me it seems to play to shougi.

76
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:28,842
I have seeds them to you ?

77
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,221
Impossible.

78
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,389
Akamaru ?

79
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,817
You hold, you take these, Akamaru.
If it does not eat you cannot recover the forces.

80
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,037
All to place, Akamaru, we go!

81
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,873
We do not have to forget us about those here.

82
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,755
Tsubaki not Never

83
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,208
Not there is place in order to hide.

84
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:49,006
Ignoring their movements
that worm  cannot  escape.

85
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,675
I will find  and I will kill  it  to more soon!

86
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,475
Arrived E' the moment.

87
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,111
Ok, is all to place. I cannot
to make other that to attack it.

88
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,617
Nine attacks remain me.
The outcome of the crash depends on they.

89
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,538
One!

90
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,627
One!

91
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,145
Too much simple! My ability in
to control them with the sound is imbattibile.

92
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,149
You will not succeed to strike to me,
any is your plan!

93
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:09,753
Two!

94
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,508
Those cursed bastard is scappato.

95
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,759
Dov' is ?

96
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,849
Three!

97
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,398
Low, eh ?

98
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:44,955
Four!

99
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,837
As it dares to make these stupiden giochetti!

100
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:57,759
Five!

101
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,677
Six!

102
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,553
Seven!

103
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,429
Otto!

104
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,907
It is alone taking time.

105
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,587
What? one bomb flash ?

106
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,546
nine!

107
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,839
Merda!

108
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,051
It is using the light for
to extend its shadow!

109
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,178
Kagemane not Jutsu!

110
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,766
The Kagemane Jutsu has not succeeded!

111
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,184
Impossible!

112
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,604
How you have made to understand their movements?

113
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,150
Impossible E' that you can
to understand mine melodia!

114
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,447
Sin from the beginning, I have not only felt music.

115
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,827
there was qualcos' other beyond to the sound.
I have perceived from your commandos.

116
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,543
Your fingers!

117
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,253
Impossible…

118
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,383
Movements of those three…
Memorizzato the positions of the fingers
and it has read my movements !

119
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,178
Impossible E'!

120
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,265
In order to begin, you move the index
and the ring finger of the right hand.

121
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,526
Then with the mean and the mignolo of
left hand you play the melodia…

122
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,737
This serves to command the type to the center.

123
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,617
Then with the inch and the index of the right hand

124
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:50,622
together to the index and the mignolo of the left,
you make to deliver a blow.

125
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,795
Schivato Hai my attacks,
and while it watches to me to you,

126
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,506
I have observed the movements of your fingers.

127
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,136
I have observed their movements,

128
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,430
memorizzato and analyzed.

129
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,647
Impossible E'.

130
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,358
They are catches to you from my kagemane not jutsu.

131
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,448
The more interesting thing of the shougi is that

132
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,620
you can use to your piacimento the pawns
adversaries who you have captured.

133
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,166
And from hour, it will be like one left of shougi.

134
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,170
Hour that they are I to having the three pawns,
it touches me to put to you in difficulty.

135
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,633
It seems sure of same you.

136
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,676
Even if you it does not remain not even a kunai.

137
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,095
My only arm is the flauto.

138
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:52,100
I have said to you that nobody does not survive
after to have felt the sound of the flauto!

139
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,061
That emergency.>.

140
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,192
Kai!

141
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,077
That pain not to know to use the own pawns!

142
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,667
Now it is my turn!

143
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:20,629
What?

144
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,550
The Kagemane has had happened.

145
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,195
Six be you to dirmi that
I had to use those three in order to stop to you?

146
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,700
I have used them like decoy.

147
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,829
The first attack was a bluff.

148
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,165
While the second was a normal attack.

149
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,250
Tu!

150
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,970
I do not have other choice.

151
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,057
To use level 2 in a place like this.>.

152
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,769
A merda will render me, but I accept it.

153
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,689
E' an honor for like you.

154
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,948
What is… this ?

155
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,495
Even if you six much wide awake one,

156
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,874
from this moment it will not go
nuller second your plans.

157
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,542
What you are saying!

158
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,592
It is trying to break off the Kagemane
not jutsu with the single force bruta ?

159
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,220
And from where comes all this chakra?

160
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:57,100
Going ahead cos ì  the technique it will disappear.

161
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,021
As I thought…  I will have  to use that technique.

162
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,068
Ninpo: KageKubi Shibari not Jutsu

163
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,327
It is using the shadow in order to take to me.

164
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,705
Me it seems of to have been taken give of the true arms!

165
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,917
But, not you  lascerò.

166
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:27,047
Eternal damnation, than power race it has?
To this distance it strikes to me in force.

167
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,508
You take this!

168
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,011
Demonic Flauto, infinite Melodia!

169
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,561
It goes badly!

170
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,313
A genjutsu?

171
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,155
At what you are aiming?

172
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,041
My body does not move.

173
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:36,366
When step to level 2 this
flauto he is able to create illusions.

174
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:40,412
Probably this melodia is perfect
for lurido a rat of drain like you.

175
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,205
Why…

176
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,962
.... this firm illusion its preda and the alloy!

177
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,093
How it is being legacies  ?

178
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,811
And this was your last movement, eh ?

179
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,356
Ill-fatedly, it is one scacco matto.

180
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,192
Ugly bastard!

181
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:14,738
What?

182
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,830
That bastard, has used the shadow in order to break off the finger!

183
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,167
With the pain if he has gone some from the illusion

184
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,003
It has made feint of to have been caught in mine jutsu!

185
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:38,595
As I have said to you before, the first movement only serves in order to distract.

186
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,349
E' to hit after is logical.

187
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,479
And only the second round is various from the first one.

188
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:54,736
More the adversary approaches to more the technique of the shadow is effective.

189
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,907
They have been too much imprudent…

190
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,159
Oh not, not of all.

191
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,209
Your greater error has been when you have
saying that your only arm was the flauto.

192
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,381
It seems sure of same you.
Even if you it does not remain not even a kunai.

193
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,800
My only arm is the flauto.

194
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,763
I have said to you that nobody does not survive
after to have felt the sound of the flauto!

195
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,016
Not to say to me…

196
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:25,726
Exact.

197
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:30,564
The reason for which I have lacked to you with the kunai

198
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:37,571
it was why you collected it
and you came towards me.

199

225

Too much real E' for being a dream.

226
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,035
Arrogant ventilation…
the special coveralls that adapted to the body.

227
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,454
Not mentono these eyes, these hats, and these sopracciglia!

228
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:55,584

E' as a storm in arrival!
