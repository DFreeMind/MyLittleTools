1
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,912
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,509
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:26,349
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:29,620
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,826
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:40,200
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:45,575
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:49,170
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,548
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:55,551
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,919
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,388
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:08,261
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,002
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,334
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:19,206
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,471
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,545 --> 00:01:24,013
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,448
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,096
It's unforgivable!

21
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:50,730
Those guys...
the Fuma Ninja...

22
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:54,642
Their feelings towards the clan
are the same as our feelings!

23
00:01:55,412 --> 00:02:00,372
Manipulating the Fuma's feelings of
wanting to restore their clan...

24
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:06,822
I'll kick Orochimaru's butt,
no matter what!

25
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:13,221
<i>Pure Terror</i>
<i>The House of Orochimaru</i>

26
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,262
How did the Pervy Sage,

27
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,830
who was once so easily defeated by
Old Lady Tsunade's numbing medicine

28
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:28,036
detect Sasame's medicine this time?

29
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:31,909
Isn't it strange that
Master Jiraiya's that sharp?

30
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,513
Hey, hey...

31
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,178
Remember when Sasame talked
about Hanzaki and said he's a traitor?

32
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:39,980
That's how I knew...

33
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:44,357
Hanzaki told me everything...

34
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:50,756
<i>When Orochimaru came to this land,</i>
<i>there were those among us</i>

35
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,793
<i>who wanted to use his strength</i>
<i>to revive the clan</i>

36
00:02:54,872 --> 00:03:00,242
<i>and those that saw his evil intent</i>
<i>and said we should not join him.</i>

37
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:05,738
<i>Hmm... so that's why you guys</i>
<i>were chased out of your village.</i>

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,022
<i>Yes. It was probably Orochimaru's idea</i>
<i>we were chased out of our village</i>

39
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,356
<i>as traitors who were getting</i>
<i>in the way of a revival of the clan.</i>

40
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,359
When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,

41
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:27,968
I knew that Sasame had ties to a group
that was on Orochimaru's side.

42
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,544
Fool!

43
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:38,911
Hey, Pervy Sage!

44
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,847
Just wait a minute!

45
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,583
I'm prepared!

46
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:49,955
Sasame, you did it so that
you could meet Arashi... Isn't that so?

47
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:56,762
I'm sorry...
that was the only thing I could do.

48
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:58,657
Master Jiraiya!

49
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:02,330
Sasame did it only because
she wanted to see her cousin.

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,437
Please forgive her!

51
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,874
I'm asking you to forgive her too!

52
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,802
The law of the Shinobi
is a strict thing...

53
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:16,241
I can't just acquit her like this.

54
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,256
Then punish me first!

55
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:30,461
I promised I'd help Sasame
see her cousin Arashi!

56
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,860
If I don't fulfill that I'll have twisted
my Way of Ninja!

57
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,270
Master Jiraiya, me too!

58
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:41,773
Now now, wait a minute!
It's not as if I'm gonna eat her alive.

59
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:42,641
- Huh?!
- Oh?

60
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:47,514
Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that

61
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:51,281
you might leave your village to
look for Arashi...

62
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:07,100
After you escort us to
Orochimaru's hideout,

63
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,695
you'll immediately head to
the inn where Hanzaki is

64
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,241
and wait there for our return.

65
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,643
That is the punishment given to you.

66
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Master Jiraiya...

67
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:20,242
Pervy Sage,
I've gotta give you more credit!

68
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,046
Thank you, Master Jiraiya!

69
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:28,789
Well, Hanzaki treated me to
a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar

70
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,657
and asked me to look after Sasame...

71
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:35,357
I thought it was something
like that anyway!

72
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,627
I feel cheated that
I gave you more credit!

73
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:41,166
He, hey...
It's all right once in a while, right?

74
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,934
There's something called
socializing for adults...

75
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,120
There it is...

76
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,882
Leave the rest to us.

77
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,156
Sasame, be careful going back
to the inn.

78
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,232
Don't worry! I will absolutely
bring Arashi back!

79
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,533
Please take care of Arashi!

80
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,409
Leave it to me!

81
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:23,670
Just wait, and rest assured that
I'll do everything I can!

82
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,373
Stop getting so carried away Naruto,
you idiot!

83
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:28,749
Oww!

84
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,183
<i>That's where...</i>

85
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,287
<i>Sasuke is...!</i>

86
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,595
So this is the only entrance...

87
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:51,632
If they're lying in wait,
we'll be picked off.

88
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,805
But there's nothing we can do but go!

89
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:56,705
Well, don't panic.

90
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,440
If three large rats go, we'll stand out.

91
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,681
First, let's send out one
that won't stand out.

92
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,346
Summoning Jutsu!

93
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,128
Hey!

94
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:17,695
Th The frog spoke!

95
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:22,031
Hey, it's been a while!
Sakura, this is Gamakichi.

96
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,562
Gamakichi?!

97
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,937
I wanted to ask you to do
some reconnaissance.

98
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:32,741
All right! That's a simple task.
Leave it to me!

99
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,745
I can't help it,
frogs give me the creeps...

100
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,824
There doesn't seem
to be anything fishy...

101
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,724
There doesn't seem to be
a trap at the entrance.

102
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,167
<i>Arashi...</i>

103
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:12,112
There's nothing to it around here.

104
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,267
Hmm...

105
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,062
What shall we do?

106
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:32,273
It seems there's no choice
but to split up into three.

107
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,603
My instinct tells me
it's the middle one!

108
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:36,471
Wait!

109
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:38,103
What the heck?!

110
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,777
At times like this, it's especially
important to move carefully...

111
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:54,462
All right, I'll go this way!

112
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:56,898
That's it?!

113
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:00,164
So what's so different from
my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?

114
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,861
Well, it's a question of feeling...

115
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,404
If you haven't found anything
after 30 minutes, come back.

116
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:08,409
Got it?

117
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:09,803
Yeah...

118
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:15,182
Naruto, Sakura, the two of you
should proceed together.

119
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:20,044
Listen, from this point forward,
it's the first avenue of hell.

120
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,549
A demon might appear,
or a snake might appear.

121
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,623
Take them on mindfully!

122
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:25,986
Yup!

123
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,053
I understand!

124
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:33,668
We're going down the middle!

125
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:36,569
Then I'm going this way...

126
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:37,805
See ya...

127
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:53,282
Hmm... the smell of face powder.

128
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,724
I'm being invited in...

129
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:05,495
In that case, it might be good fun
to accept the invitation.

130
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,149
What...?

131
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,651
Because guests would be
arriving from far away,

132
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:34,561
I was directed by Lord Orochimaru
to entertain.

133
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm guessing
it's a type of fox raccoon ghost...

134
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:42,270
If you're saying
I'm some raccoon or fox,

135
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,005
you ought to come over here
and check to see if I have a tail or not.

136
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:52,710
Oh, this path was right on...

137
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,617
<i>How about yours, Naruto?</i>

138
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,946
Sakura, be careful!

139
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:04,016
There's no telling what sort
of traps there might be...

140
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,057
Yeah...

141
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,729
- Oh?!
- Naruto?!

142
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,724
And you were the one who
said to be careful!

143
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,197
It was an ingenious trap floor!

144
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:19,771
Oh!

145
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:22,070
What the hell is next!

146
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:25,678
Sakura!

147
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,813
Naruto!

148
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,218
It's my fault...

149
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:40,922
Naruto!

150
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:42,794
What the hell...

151
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,071
I can't get out...

152
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:50,532
What're you doing?!

153
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:53,802
You screamed in such
a misleading way, I totally thought...

154
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,141
Give me a hand!

155
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:58,605
You're really a handful!

156
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,084
Ya saved me...

157
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,586
Really! I'll go first!

158
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,323
Naruto...

159
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,229
It's all right now.

160
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,064
Here!

161
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,374
Huh?!

162
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:41,822
Naruto!

163
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:48,886
Naruto!

164
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,157
Naruto!

165
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,230
Sakura...

166
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,699
Naruto?! Are you all right?

167
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,205
Don't worry about me.

168
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,445
You need to hurry and
get out of this trap hallway!

169
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:06,510
But...

170
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:10,842
I said go! I'll follow behind for sure!

171
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,111
Really?

172
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,349
Yeah... I'll catch up in no time!

173
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:23,425
You'd better come, no matter what.

174
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,628
It's a promise, you know...

175
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:36,302
<i>The sake doesn't seem</i>
<i>tampered with.</i>

176
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:40,243
<i>So what kind of plot has been prepared... ?

177
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:46,553
Just as I'd expect from
the Village Hidden in Sound...

178
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:50,148
Are you planning to put a Jutsu
on me using music?

179
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:56,287
The music isn't only for guests.
It's for myself...

180
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:57,723
I see...

181
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:01,195
What do you play for your heart?

182
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:08,167
Music for my own funeral...

183
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,689
Trying to seduce me...
You've underestimated this Jiraiya!

184
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:51,012
Escorting the guest to
the underworld is my last mission.

185
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,857
A suspended ceiling?!

186
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,597
I need to hurry up
and get out of this place!

187
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,164
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

188
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,029
This is torture!

189
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,472
What the hell?!

190
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,264
Give me a hand!

191
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,443
We need to build up our Chakra
and create the Rasengan!

192
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,237
Don't be absurd!

193
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,081
We can't stretch
our bodies beyond this!

194
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:24,016
My muscles are cramping up!

195
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,718
Man! I've gotta do something...

196
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,488
- What!
- Huh?!

197
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:30,926
What?!

198
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,018
- Water?!
- Water!

199
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:47,065
Looks like I've been saved.

200
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,711
Hey, get outta my way!

201
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,307
Oh, it's you, Naruto.

202
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:56,776
Gamakichi, is there
a way out somewhere?

203
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,819
Don't know!
I was flushed down here too.

204
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,223
So it's no good...

205
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,558
Hey, are you all right?

206
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,689
How could I be all right!

207
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,652
Naruto's taking a long time.

208
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,158
Maybe I should go back...

209
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:23,037
It's admirable that
you made it this far, Sakura.

210
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,668
Is that Kabuto's voice?!

211
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,474
Isn't it ironic?

212
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:33,414
During the Chunin Exam
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves,

213
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:36,179
you were the only one
that dragged the team down,

214
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,584
but yet you're the one
to make it this far.

215
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,281
I'm not by myself!

216
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,390
Naruto and Master Jiraiya
will be here right away!

217
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,529
Where's Sasuke?
He is all right, isn't he?

218
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:52,499
Shouldn't you be worried about
Naruto and Master Jiraiya,

219
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,036
and not Sasuke?

220
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:03,168
Well, it may very well be that those two
are no longer in this world anymore.

221
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:04,878
No way...

222
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:11,180
There's no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto
would be taken down that easily!

223
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,250
I wonder if that's so?

224
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:18,651
Maybe you dragged Naruto
down like you always do?

225
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,962
So I'm right...

226
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,531
<i>Naruto...</i>

227
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,301
If you're worried
you should go and see...

228
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,112
Or perhaps you're afraid
of me attacking

229
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:40,479
and you can't come out
from behind the pillar.

230
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,387
If someone like you were
on my team,

231
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:48,253
I don't know how many lives
I would need.

232
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:49,649
I can too...

233
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,050
I can too!

234
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,264
Substitution Jutsu?!

235
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,101
Substitution again?!

236
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,839
I can too...
When I fight, I fight!

237
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,716
As I thought, this is all you've got...

238
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,053
It's about time I put an end to this.

239
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:26,157
I can't keep Lord Orochimaru waiting
for no reason any longer, you see.

240
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,262
<i>Orochimaru?!</i>

241
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,641
<i>Now...shall we see...</i>

242
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:44,411
<i>just who will be stealing</i>
<i>scrolls from whom?</i>

243
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,817
<i>We'll fight to the death!</i>

244
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,046
No! I'm different from how I was... then!

245
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:25,115
I wonder if that's true...

246
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:39,366
It can't be...

247
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:45,033
Even if you put up a bluff,
I can foresee...

248
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:49,937
You are already... finished.

249
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:28,443
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

250
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:34,820
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

251
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:45,392
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

252
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:55,167
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

253
00:21:56,913 --> 00:22:01,907
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

254
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:11,217
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

255
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:22,930
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

256
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:33,372
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

257
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:46,126
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

258
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,263
I'm scared.
What is this intimidating feeling?

259
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:56,469
My legs are weak and
I don't have any strength in my body.

260
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,104
I thought I'm not the same person
as I was in the past.

261
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,437
I must stop. Calm down.

262
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:06,314
These guys are here,
which means Sasuke is definitely here!

263
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:10,379
I need to fight!
I came here to save Sasuke!

264
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,547
Next time, "Two Heartbeats:
Kabuto's Trap"
