They are Feels, and he Bunzo.

99
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:18,170
Our getlteman has ordered to us to recover the money 3 fà years.

100
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,552
We have left mountains of Akagi with the promise

101
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,554
not to return without the money

102
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,935
We have followed the traces ovunque

103
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:38,815
but it has been hard, it arrived and it left unexpectedly

104
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:45,948
But finally, we have had information that were in zone

105

Cos ì  we have waited for close to the main road

106
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,539
Then you have seen to us to arrive with Tsunade the old one

107
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,876
But because you have perquisito my room?

108
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,005
One says that it cannot be dealt with the losing leggendaria

109
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,218
We have thought that if we had gone directly from she,
it would not have paid to us.

110
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,262
It is  true that it is tirchia.

111
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,474
We have thought that it would have paid if we had had

112
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,685
the more important thing of its life, the necklace

113
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,647
It does not interest to me! You have perquisito my room!

114
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:23,652
We did not think that the necklace had changed owner

115
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:29,658
Euh.... you could try to ask them to pay to us?

116
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,659
Eh?

117
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,911

Finally it has ended

122
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,389
That misfortune…

123
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,683
Eternal damnation, is empty!

124
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,770
Well, we stop to play to the Pachinko and go to the terme

125
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,271

We have left the ag the hotel, true?

128
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,984

00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,112
You will not want that it goes to take it…

130

137
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,390
But…

138
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,483

00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,196
Thanks

141
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,573
You are a friend of Tsunade-sama?

142
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,783
S ì.

143
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,078
There is a message for she.

144
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,871
One letter?

145
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,872
From part of who?

146
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:04,670
Tsunade-sama!

147
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,879
Tsunade-sama!

148
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,381
Tsunade-samaa!

149
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,882
Eh?

150
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,592
Tsunade-sama!

151
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,596
If n' it has gone.

152
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,643
It listens, Tonton… finds Tsunade-sama

153
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,894
You have understood?

154
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,819
What? You cannot? Why!?

155
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,113
I understand.

156
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,907
The vapor of sources prevents it to use its correctly fiuto.

157
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,994
Then we will try it on foot!

158
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,370
Tsunade-sama!

159
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,330
Tsunade-sama…

160
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,999
Tsunade-sama!

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,126
Tsunade-sama!

162
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,003
Tsunade-sama!

163
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,213
Where you are?

164
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,299
There is a problem!

165
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,593
Tsunade-sama!

166
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,724
What I must make?

167
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,102
Uzumaki Naruto is in our hands

168
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,522
If you want it safe and sound, paid your debit!

169
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,109
We will wait for to you close to the three trees on the hill. Akagi Family.

170
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,196
That to make…? We must save Naruto-kun!

171
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,782
And for more, if the debits of Tsunade-sama were discoveries,

172
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,870
it could have problems to become the Fifth Hokage

173
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,834
We must take care of!

174
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,836
Of agreement, Tonton?

175
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,719
I ask myself if he will work.

176
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,346
Not to worry to you!

177
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,889
He arrives!

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,812
Tsunade the Old one!

179
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:46,939
Stopped!

180
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,442
Sai who we are, true?

181
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,028
Served the Akagi clan, is not cos ì?

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,405
In this case, it is useless to say other.

183
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,534
You render the money us that you have asked to us on loan!

184
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,827
Otherwise…

185
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,413
Morirà!

186
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,458
You save to me!

187
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,295
It does not interest to me what you will make it…

188
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,631
Which thing!?

189
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,216
Then.... For the money…

190
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,722
Why it has gone cos ì…

191
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,226
I want beautiful girls! Hour is only a large one casino!

192
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,025
I must resist…

193
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,031
You have felt to me?

194
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,952
It does not interest to me what you will make it.

195
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,830
You old witch!

196
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,542
This is  that  that I would have said until little ago

197
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,046
But now that they are Hokage, I have need of a servitore small.

198
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,048
I cannot leave it to die in front of my eyes

199
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,427
Uhh Tsunade the Old one

200
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,763
This is all  that  that I have hour

201
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,265
Prendeteli!

202
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,855
Fatemi to control

203
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:19,031
I cannot knit the debit, but those are enough for the interests, just?

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,789
They were is made!!!

205
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,132
You do not want to pay the debit?

206
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,134
It does not regard to you.

207
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,138
But these persons will not be able to return in their village! They do not make pain you?

208
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,057
Tu! It is not possible!

209
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:48,060
Then, we must take the moneies with the force!

210
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,731
They were cloni of Naruto?

211
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,402
I understand, Naruto-kun has formed an alliance with the Akagi family

212
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,155
If it is cos ì,  than intentions they will have?

213
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:08,664
I did not expect that it would have paid without to fight,
but me I did not wait for cos ì  treacherous

214
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,249
What now we make?

215
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,876
The old one has one large ag.

216
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,671
They are sure that it is full of money.

217
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,049
We will take the ag, does not import like

218
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:32,771
Merda! it is drinking of the sakè while it knows that they have been kidnapped!

219
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,023
That one must be the ag

220
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,067
How we will make to take it?

221
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,444

222
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,660

223
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,247
Ah, here the ag!

00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,542
He is  imprudent to leave it here, I go to put it to the sure one.

225
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,210

226
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,270

00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,980

229
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,071

00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,574

If the six Hokage, satisfied your debit!

232
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,583
The Hokage is R-he who protegge all, right?

233
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:39,630
These poveretti cannot return from their beloveds…

234
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,964
Naruto-saint…

235
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,885
Or perhaps… Does not interest you  that  that it happens elsewhere?

236
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,639
I will not accept  one person cos ì  like Hokage!

237
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,474

238
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:54,978

Kage bunshin not Jutsu!

255
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,105
But that devil…

256
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,108
Naruto-kun, we count on you…

257
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,989

Naruto-saint!

275
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,712
It prepares you for the defeat!

276
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,473
Merda! It leaves me!

277
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,808
You are calm!

292
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,149

293
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,651
You do not know it!?

294
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,571
He is  the head of this province, large the Jirocho-saint one!

295
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,032
He is  an old friend.

297
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,538

301
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,217
I have them reimburses a year makes to you.

302
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,636
Truly?

303
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,641
I have paid the slid year when we were in the pressed ones of the Akagi, not memories?

304
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,934
They are desolated…

305
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,143
Ehi!

306
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:45,727

309
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:56,905
Senta and Bunzo, the debit has been reimbursed, returned to the village.

310
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,574
Akagi Shuugo

311
00:19:59,074 --> 00:19:59,783
You see?

312
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,037
Which thing?

313
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,125

314
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,254

Be prudent!

319
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:27,769
Why pressed you a lot to recover the ag if not there were money within?

320
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:33,358
Why if you had seen changes them to them and uncovered our huge debits

321
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,821
The title it of Fifth Hokage di Tsunade-sama would have been in danger.

322
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,574
It preoccupies to you too much

323
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,826
To have debits it does not prevent to become Hokage

324
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,621
Then you will reimburse all your debits.

325
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,081
Not there is no reason to preoccuparsi.

326
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,334
We do not have preoccuparci of the Akagi family

327
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,170
Calm, calm

328
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,007

329
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,353
