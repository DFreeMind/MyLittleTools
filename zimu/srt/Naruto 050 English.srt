2
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:35,971
I can't be the only one who loses here!

3
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,273
Gai-sensei, please acknowledge that...

4
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,052
...this is the time...

5
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:54,303
...to carry out and to protect my Nindo (way of Ninja)!

6
00:01:54,776 --> 00:02:00,276
Oh, Rock Lee! This is how a man lives!!

7
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,435
His body color turns...

8
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:06,977
Red!

9
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
What is he?!

10
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:22,141
He's opened the third gate, Sei-Mon.

11
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,875
He'll start!

12
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,457
No, not yet!

13
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,445
What?

14
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:35,373
Furthermore... forth gate Sho-Mon, open!

15
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:46,783
What a guy! His hard work had nothing to do with that.

16
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:50,540
That boy... must be a genius after all.

17
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:03,021
Fast!

18
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,962
Where are they?

19
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:10,834
Above!

20
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:17,220
But I can't see Lee.

21
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:18,551
Where?

22
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:28,386
The sand can't even catch up with his speed at all.

23
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,760
He's still wearing that sand armor.

24
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:41,643
Fine then... how about this?!

25
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,891
What?!  The sand armor is...

26
00:03:57,548 --> 00:03:59,410
...starting to come off.

27
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:02,832
You don't go down so easy?

28
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,158
If that's the case...!

29
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,011
His muscle just snapped.

30
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:19,461
Is that really Lee? Since when he become so...

31
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,932
This is the end!

32
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:29,086
Fifth gate,To-Mon... Open!

33
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:32,585
I can't defend myself anymore.

34
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:35,622
Is his movement humanly possible?!

35
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:44,585
Neji... This special technique I was saving to use on
you. But I'll make an exception... and let you see it!

36
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,226
The sand shield can't catch up with him.

37
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,930
The sand armor has mostly come off.  This isn't good.

38
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:11,910
Incredible!

39
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,603
Ura Renge (Reverse Lotus)... That is the ultra
high-speed Taijutsu that nobody can touch.

40
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:23,850
The answer to defeat Neji is this high-speed
combination. It's impossible for the sand to catch up.

41
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,637
This technique will be the last.

42
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,269
Ura Renge!

43
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,774
It's too fast to tell what's going on....

44
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,074
It can't be...!

45
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,170
The gourd turned into sand?!

46
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:11,265
It is truly over this time!

47
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,548
What is that?

48
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:42,356
He protected himself with his gourd made of sand?

49
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,277
That technique was...!

50
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,814
Sabaku-Kyu!

51
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,424
No way! He can still attack after receiving Ura Renge?!

52
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,095
Sabaku-Kyu!

53
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,382
I can't...lose at this stage...

54
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:56,665
I...my Nindo...

55
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:08,438
This isn't good!

56
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,660
Die!

57
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,514
Why....

58
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:58,328
Why did you save him?

59
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,084
This boy is...

60
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,899
I'm alright because I'm strong.

61
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:13,504
Gai-sensei... Just smile and watch during the Chunin exam.

62
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:19,498
I want to prove that I can be a respectable
Ninja, even if I can use neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu!!

63
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,996
That is everything to me!

64
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,912
This boy is...

65
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:32,767
my precious, beloved subordinate!

66
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:47,230
His beloved subordinate?

67
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:52,401
Those are words that Gaara can never comprehend.

68
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:00,805
I'm done.

69
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,679
He's done...?

70
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,811
When Gai stepped in, Lee lost the match.

71
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,548
The winner, Gaa..

72
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,117
Impossible!

73
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:55,191
After opening five gates he can't be standing
with his arms and legs crushed!

74
00:10:57,969 --> 00:11:03,451
Lee, it's alright. It's over. Your
body isn't strong enough to standup now.

75
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:14,883
Lee, you...You are...

76
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:30,325
...still trying to prove your
Nindo... even after you've lost consciousness.

77
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:38,813
I see, he's not consciousness anymore.

78
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,586
You are already...

79
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,587
...a respectable Ninja.

80
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:02,002
The winner, Gaara.

81
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,514
What can you do for him by going down there?

82
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,063
It'll be just painful for him to hear your cheer.

83
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,933
There's no way to defeat Gaara.

84
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:55,636
He was forced to fight a tougher
match than I expected it would be.

85
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:14,347
I can't believe Geji-Mayu
(thick-eyebrows) lost to a guy like this.

86
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,624
Medical team, hurry up.

87
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:26,150
Geji-Mayu!

88
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,963
You're the Jounin who's in charge of this boy, right?

89
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:59,477
Y..Yes.

90
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:02,023
Please come over here.

91
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,717
Be gentle.

92
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,552
Don't swing him.

93
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:27,262
He is breathing, though barely...

94
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,603
...but he's got crushed bones and
snapped muscles throughout his body.

95
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:35,154
It will take a very long time for him to recover.

96
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:41,760
It would be fine, if that was all...

97
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:51,685
The damage to his left arm and leg
that was attacked is severe... very severe.

98
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,129
I don't want to tell you this, but...

99
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:08,096
He can no longer live as a Ninja with that body.

100
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,945
That...that can't be true!

101
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:27,358
I'll fight with Geji-Mayu!

102
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:31,569
It's not you with whom I want to fight. It's Uchiha.

103
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:34,481
You!

104
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:37,895
I can understand your feelings...

105
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,110
But a battle must be fought in a real match.

106
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:48,753
A looser will beat an elite with his hard
work. It's going to be fun in the real final exams.

107
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:53,128
It may be I who will fight against him.

108
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:03,596
Lee, I didn't want to think that you were going to lose.

109
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:09,983
I wanted to help you achieve your Nindo.

110
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:16,337
Yey! Finally I mastered it! Yahoo! Alright!

111
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:21,039
Only Lee could master this technique.

112
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,784
Alright! You guys are Genin from
today. I want to hear your goals.

113
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:31,320
Me! Me!

114
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:38,169
I want to prove that I can be a respectable
Ninja, even if I can use neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu!!

115
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,874
That's everything to me!

116
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:48,191
Please forgive me, I couldn't stop you.

117
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,452
It can't be true! It must be a lie!

118
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:01,497
What will Geji-Mayu do if he's told such a thing?!

119
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:08,374
He said a looser will beat an elite with his hard work!

120
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,158
Can't you do something?

121
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,330
Calm down, Naruto!

122
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:22,083
But, Kakashi-sensei! He kept saying that he really
wants to fight against Sasuke and Neji!

123
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,404
Or, that caused this tragedy.

124
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:32,784
To achieve his dream, that boy tried to win this match
desperately, even using a forbidden technique.

125
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,597
This is the result of that.

126
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:55,433
That boy sacrificed himself to an unspoken promise
with Sasuke, Neji-kun, and you, Naruto.

127
00:17:56,705 --> 00:18:02,088
He risked his life to reach the
stage where he can fight against you guys.

128
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,332
Don't forget that.

129
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:21,975
I wonder if Lee-san's gonna be alright.

130
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:31,488
Lee, you never realized it even at the end.

131
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:42,707
Heaven forbids a guy to go to the next level if the
only way for him to win is to risk his own life.

132
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:02,456
It's over without any trouble.

133
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,681
Welcome back, Gaara.

134
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:33,587
Gai! I spoke to you arrogantly
earlier... ...but if I was in your shoes...

135
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,528
I probably couldn't stop the fight either.

136
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:49,062
Gai, the next match can't be started
if we're here. Let's go back up.

137
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:53,749
Yeah...

138
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,192
Well... The final tenth match. Both of you, come forward.

139
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:09,018
It's finally my turn.

140
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:16,288
I'm gonna eat Yakiniku (Korean BBQ) after I win!

141
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,663
I really need to stay in for the final
matches to fight against Sasuke-kun. Otherwise...

142
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:27,369
...I can't meet your expectation, Orochimaru-sama.

143
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,026
I can guess the reason why....

144
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:38,017
...you gave a cursed seal to Sasuke-kun, instead
of killing him, when you meet him before us.

145
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:45,123
We were just tools to find out Sasuke-kun's
ability during the exam.

146
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:50,627
What you want is not Sasuke-kun's life, but Sasuke himself.

147
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:55,743
"Dosu Kinuta vs. Akimichi Choji" but he's underestimated me.

148
00:20:56,461 --> 00:21:00,965
Well, let the tenth match... Begin!

149
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:40,282
Sakura-chan! Do you know
where Kakashi-sensei is?

150
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,136
I'll ask him to train me until the final real exams.

151
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:47,667
I think Kakashi-sensei
is where Sasuke-kun is.

152
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,777
What's wrong, Sakura-chan. Aren't you a bit down?

153
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:54,704
No, not really. But I feel uneasy.

154
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:59,191
Next episode. A shadow moving in the
darkness. Crisis approaching Sasuke!

155
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,241
For some reason, I feel anxious.
