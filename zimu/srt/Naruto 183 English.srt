1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,518
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,353
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:12,455
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:28,913
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:34,351
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,048
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,558
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:45,086
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:51,726
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,767
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:02,212
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:07,617
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:19,594
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:49,652
Wait, Naruto!

16
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:51,251
I won't wait.

17
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,395
I told you not to be acting
on your own.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,900
Then you're saying to
leave Sumaru be?!

19
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:00,137
Sumaru just now seemed
quite upset...

20
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:03,605
He's definitely intending to
get revenge on Akahoshi.

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,644
Now that he's been tarred with
the reputation of Rogue Ninja,

22
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,339
he'll have no place to go
throughout his life

23
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,314
if he raises a hand against
the village leader.

24
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:14,514
Hokuto?

25
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:47,819
Mother!

26
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,054
I finally...

27
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:56,724
Here, I finally got to meet you...

28
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,559
Mother.

29
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,509
<i>The Star's Radiance</i>

30
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,384
Wh What're you doing?

31
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,052
Shh! Don't be acting on
your own anymore.

32
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,462
But, something's strange.

33
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:35,030
This number of Ninja is
indeed something serious.

34
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:38,168
It seems they've mobilized all
of the village Ninja.

35
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:41,304
Anyway, we should see
how things go for a little while.

36
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:46,101
<i>Byakugan!</i>

37
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,453
Sumaru's inside the training room...

38
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,692
Hey, what about Sumaru's mom?

39
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:02,789
Damn it!

40
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,559
Sumaru...

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,425
Do w e really have to do away
with him?

42
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:13,729
He's still a kid.
Wouldn't it be okay to let things slide?

43
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,232
At this moment,
he's a dangerous element.

44
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,868
No good would come
of letting him live.

45
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:23,012
But Sumaru's been
the most effective Genin in the village.

46
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,816
We have more than
enough materials...

47
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,052
We can just train more...

48
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:29,654
Materials...?!

49
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:32,656
I won't stand for it anymore!
Leave it to me!

50
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,424
- Forget about it.
- Let go of me!

51
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,594
I'm going to kick
that Akahoshi jerk's butt.

52
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:38,453
This is a Star Village issue.

53
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:42,065
Village issues have to be resolved
by those in the village.

54
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,493
Isn't there something
we can do for him?

55
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,931
That's right.

56
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:49,098
Let's charge on in and
box Akahoshi's ears...

57
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,573
What're you saying?

58
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,473
That'd be the same as Naruto!

59
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,708
Are you saying we must
remain idle spectators

60
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,145
even when things have gone this far?!

61
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,144
That's right!

62
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:01,118
As long as there's no commission from
the villagerto kick Akahoshi's butt,

63
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:03,313
there's nothing we can do.

64
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,649
Archer unit! Forward!

65
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,032
Fire!

66
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:23,940
Until now, I felt resentment towards you,
Mother, for leaving me behind.

67
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,508
But... I understand clearly now.

68
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,215
I understand why you
had to do that.

69
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:40,821
Akahoshi... I will never forgive him!

70
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:46,887
<i>Sumaru...</i>

71
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,718
Wh What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!

72
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,253
What're you talking about...?

73
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:18,228
I buried them both together...
There is no greater happiness.

74
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,700
<i>Incredible Chakra!</i>

75
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:40,980
Wait!

76
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,715
This jerk's an enemy...
He suddenly attacked.

77
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,187
You're Leaf Shinobi, right?

78
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,356
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround...

79
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,898
The people from other lands
are all after the star.

80
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,029
If you have that power,

81
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:03,806
you can stand above all of
the Hidden Villages.

82
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:07,443
Is your awesome Chakra also
the power of the star?

83
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:10,176
If they had that star,

84
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:12,239
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?

85
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:15,309
No! The more tremendous the pow er,

86
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,321
the more hard work is required
to control it!

87
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,151
I'll work hard, work hard, work hard!

88
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,456
I'll become the Hoshikage!

89
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:25,395
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!

90
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,993
I'm also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!

91
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,037
You're a strange guy.

92
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,329
Really?

93
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,074
That red star sure is pretty...

94
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:40,976
Natsuhiboshi...

95
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,408
It watches over me all the time...

96
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,351
Are you still gonna say
I should bear it after all this?

97
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,058
Sumaru!

98
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,067
Sumaru...

99
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,680
Listen, everyone.

100
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:20,415
If you continue the star training,
you'll all die.

101
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:25,956
Sumaru's mother is the one
who took away the star.

102
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:30,722
She did that in order to
protect everyone's lives!

103
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,223
Lord Akahoshi?

104
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,632
Is it true that we'll die?

105
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:42,032
Are you going to believe
such nonsense?!

106
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:45,105
Being unable to withstand
the star training

107
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,304
is because the heart that loves
the village is weak!

108
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:55,419
Those who really love the village
can become true Shinobi

109
00:08:55,487 --> 00:09:00,151
and can also surpass the Hidden Villages
of the Five Great Nations!

110
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:04,526
Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi...
Who's telling the truth?

111
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:15,537
Mizura?!

112
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,932
In that condition...!
It's reckless!

113
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:21,142
Wait, everyone!

114
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:29,285
There's... There's something
I want everyone to see.

115
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,523
Mizura...

116
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,723
What's that?

117
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:41,995
What's going on?

118
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,300
Is that the effect of the training?

119
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:46,829
How awful.

120
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:52,339
Lord Akahoshi... I take pride in
the Hidden Star Village.

121
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:55,613
Even though it was painful,

122
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,376
I endured it and continued
the star training...

123
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:03,787
Even so, w ere my feelings for
the village still not enough?

124
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:06,721
Mizura!

125
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:11,025
I don't think there could be lies
in that child's words... and body.

126
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:16,328
Yes. So that's why
the Third Hoshikage prohibited

127
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,426
the star training for a long while.

128
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:23,401
We adults got carried away with
our feelings for the village

129
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:24,942
and may have made the wrong choice...

130
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,270
You loser!

131
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:30,777
Do you intend to mislead everyone
and crush the villaget?!

132
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,882
What're you doing, Akahoshi?!

133
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,812
They aren't traitors.

134
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,886
They're children of our village!

135
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,629
Protect Hokuto and Mizura.

136
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,892
Are you going to betray the village?!

137
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:54,905
I can't go along with your way
of doing things, Lord Akahoshi!

138
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,338
Me, too.

139
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,533
Me, too!

140
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:00,478
Me, too.

141
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,603
Me, too.

142
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,182
Death to those who betray the village!

143
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,477
Execute them all!

144
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:12,087
Are you insane, Akahoshi?

145
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:15,955
If we lost all the children,
there'd be no future for the village!

146
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:18,992
H Hey...
You're taking things too far, Akahoshi.

147
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:22,289
Take everyone's feelings into
consideration and yield for now.

148
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,894
Shut up!
What're you doing talking nice now?

149
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,163
We've long since dirtied our hands.

150
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,932
S Stop! What're you going to say?

151
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,335
Akahoshi, what do you mean?

152
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:38,682
There's a star in this village that
no other villages possess.

153
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,876
I just thought we didn't need
a foolish village leader

154
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,512
who wouldn't allow the star to be used.

155
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,148
What?!

156
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:48,483
Could it be that you are the ones who
killed the Third Hoshikage?!

157
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:53,023
Indeed, there were suspicious rumors
concerning the Third Hoshikage's death.

158
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,161
Akahoshi, prepare yourself
and answer!

159
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,628
You'll pay depending on your answer.

160
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,602
The three of us assassinated
the Third Hoshikage!

161
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,205
It was the quickest way
to save the village.

162
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,379
Say what?!

163
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:11,981
You guys are the traitors!

164
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,642
-Right!
-Right! Right!

165
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:15,618
No, don't get the wrong idea.

166
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,086
We just helped a little.

167
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,589
Idiot. That'll be an acknowledgement!

168
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,817
Akahoshi!

169
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,620
We will not acknowledge you
as leader of the village.

170
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,331
Justice is not with you anymore.

171
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:30,064
It is the children who possess the hearts
that truly care about the village.

172
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:35,202
Everyone! Let us rise together
with those children

173
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:37,468
for the sake of the village.

174
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:39,167
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

175
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,272
We're sorry, children.

176
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:49,711
We were completely taken in
by Akahoshi's fast talk.

177
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:53,213
As of now, we'll fight with you!

178
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,160
Give it up, Akahoshi.

179
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,820
We've lost!

180
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:02,025
Shut up! I haven't lost.

181
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,537
Mizura!

182
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:13,767
Hokuto... Live for me...

183
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,211
Mizura!

184
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:20,313
Akahoshi, we won't let you do as
you please anymore!

185
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:24,314
I won't let you do something
like go against me!

186
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:25,984
Have you gone mad?!

187
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,883
Akahoshi, you've lost!

188
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,850
Give in to justice with good grace!

189
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,429
I won't lose!

190
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,101
The star is now... in my hands!

191
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:39,365
The star?!

192
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:45,108
I will now become
the Fourth Hoshikage!

193
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:25,778
Power... I'm starting to brim
with power.

194
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,216
I do not need any training.

195
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,013
I could have become one with
the star if I'd done this from the start...

196
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,720
What... What's this?

197
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:47,237
What's that?!

198
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:49,435
<i>Byakugan.</i>

199
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:59,442
Massive Chakra from the star has
poured into his Chakra Network

200
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:01,246
and is causing it to go out of control.

201
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:38,786
Hokuto!

202
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:03,113
I can't take it anymore!
Neji! Hey, Neji!

203
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:07,113
Don't... Naruto...

204
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:11,482
No matter what you say,
I'll kick that Akahoshi jerk's butt!

205
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,989
You jerk. I won't be responsible.

206
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:21,154
Right. Just say that I butt in on my own.

207
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,063
L-Lord Akahoshi.

208
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,477
Akahoshi!

209
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:46,180
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

210
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,125
Damn it!

211
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,700
You jerk.

212
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,283
Damn you...

213
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,985
<i>Natsuhiboshi...</i>

214
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:26,792
- <i>why are you so red?</i>
- Sumaru's mom...

215
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,229
- <i>Because...</i>
- That's her voice.

216
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,735
<i>I had a sad dream last night</i>

217
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:38,066
<i>My eyes are red, from the tears I shed</i>

218
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:43,813
<i>Swollen as I cried...</i>

219
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:49,744
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?</i>

220
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,987
- <i>I'm searching for a child...</i>
- Sumaru...

221
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:55,548
<i>who has gone afar</i>

222
00:17:55,994 --> 00:18:01,591
<i>He can't be found, though I search all day</i>

223
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:05,130
- <i>My sad dreams come once more...</i>
- <i>The Ninja Art. Kujaku...</i>

224
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:08,900
<i>to be controlled even after death.</i>
<i>At that time, Natsuhi did...</i>

225
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,274
<i>Damn you, Natsuhi!</i>

226
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,277
<i>You protect Sumaru even after you die?!</i>

227
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:24,822
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why are you red?</i>

228
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:30,455
<i>Because I had a sad dream last night</i>

229
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,224
- <i>My eyes are red...</i>
- Sumaru's mom...

230
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:36,495
- <i>from the tears I shed</i>
- Are you saying you'll lend me support?!

231
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:41,495
- <i>Swollen as I cried</i>
- All right. Got it!

232
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:48,269
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?</i>

233
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:53,612
<i>I'm searching for a child</i>
<i>who has gone afar</i>

234
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,486
- <i>He can't be found...</i>
- Rasengan!

235
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:59,523
- <i>though I search all day</i>
- Wh What?!

236
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,859
- My sad dreams come once more
- Go!

237
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,568
Despite having been assigned
a mission to protect the star,

238
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,803
to think you'd smash
the all-important star...

239
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,742
You didn't just fail to complete
the mission!

240
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,282
The compensation fee
will be massive.

241
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:30,086
But Grandma, I had no other choice!

242
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:33,721
It's my fault as the leader for
not being able to stop him.

243
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,825
I'm responsible as well!

244
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:37,889
Right. I also...

245
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,190
Well, that'd be a matter
under normal circumstances.

246
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,134
We haven't received complaints
from the Star Village

247
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:45,999
with regard to the incident of
the star being smashed.

248
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,435
In fact, the culprit of this incident

249
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,567
was the client Akahoshi,
the deputy Hoshikage.

250
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,236
So the mission itself is forgotten!

251
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:59,048
Come to think of it,
what happened to him?

252
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:00,848
It seems the three,

253
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,978
the main culprit Akahoshi and
accomplices Yotaka and Shisou,

254
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:07,554
will be punished severely
by Hidden Star Village!

255
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,562
That's good! Now the Star Village
will be peaceful.

256
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:15,857
Come in.

257
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:20,966
Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from
the Star Village bave been examined.

258
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,033
And...?

259
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,507
If they all receive proper treatment,
they will return to good health.

260
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:27,374
Hey, what about Mizura?

261
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,412
Yes. That boy will also be fine.

262
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:32,511
Yes! So, where's everyone?

263
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:35,015
They've completed their examinations
and are heading for their quarters.

264
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:38,649
Hey, Naruto! The lecture isn't...

265
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:41,986
He never changes.

266
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,262
Hey, guys.

267
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,761
That's great! Get better, Mizura.

268
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,866
Right!

269
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,103
I won't lose to you.

270
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:57,304
Huh, what?!

271
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,974
I'll become Hoshikage before you!

272
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,302
Even without the pow er of the star,

273
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,339
I'll make the Village Hidden in the Stars
into a most powerful Ninja village!

274
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:08,184
Say what?

275
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,885
No way will I lose!
I'll become Hokage before you!

276
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,748
Shut up. I'll be first.

277
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,452
I'll be first, believe it!

278
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:29,739
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

279
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:36,411
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

280
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,019
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

281
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:58,899
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

282
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,998
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

283
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:10,980
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

284
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:17,886
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

285
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:24,656
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

286
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:31,430
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

287
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:38,107
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

288
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:45,141
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

289
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:53,388
Kiba Inuzuka escaped with Akamaru!

290
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,355
Kiba did?!

291
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,322
Then, have a Special Pursuit Corps
stand by in preparation for the worst.

292
00:22:58,396 --> 00:22:58,691
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:00,822
Hey, just a minute. Then they'll...

294
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:01,865
We have no choice.

295
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,995
The safety of the residents
must take precedence.

296
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:06,398
But Akamaru is Kiba's partner.

297
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,528
I'm aware of that.

298
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:08,128
Then...

299
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:12,164
Shut up, Naruto! I have an obligation
to protect this village.

300
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:15,744
Next time: "Kiba's Long Day"
