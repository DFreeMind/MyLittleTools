1
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:03,986
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:06,821
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:12,923
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:29,381
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,819
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,516
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,026
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:45,554
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,194
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,235
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,680
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:08,085
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:11,248
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:20,062
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:47,258
<i>Multiple Traps!</i>
<i>Countdown to Destruction</i>

16
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,961
This many Paper Bombs...
is a diversion?

17
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:53,424
Y Yes!

18
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:54,900
No way...

19
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:58,070
No. He's a man who
would go that far...

20
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,639
After all, he is Genno
the Trapper!

21
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:10,940
<i>Remember. Think.</i>
<i>His actions thus far...</i>

22
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:12,910
<i>His intent hidden in there.</i>

23
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:22,393
<i>First he steals the blueprints</i>
<i>for key facilities in the village</i>

24
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,589
<i>and pretends to blow himself up</i>
<i>in front of the Anbu Black Ops.</i>

25
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:28,826
<i>Because of the incident,</i>

26
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,336
<i>an S Level Emergency</i>
<i>Security Alert is given...</i>

27
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,440
<i>The village becomes poorly manned...</i>

28
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,373
<i>and Genno is able to</i>
<i>move around as he pleases...</i>

29
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,847
<i>Then why did he scatter</i>
<i>the blueprints he stole?</i>

30
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,585
<i>With this incident, it becomes evident</i>
<i>that Genno might still be alive</i>

31
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:49,144
<i>so the guys on watch outside</i>
<i>end up returning</i>

32
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:50,712
<i>to the village as quickly possible...</i>

33
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:55,318
<i>Could that have been his objective?</i>

34
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,025
<i>He directed everyone's attention</i>
<i>to the Paper Bombs</i>

35
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,930
<i>and reassembled</i>
<i>the village Shinobi.</i>

36
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:05,764
<i>If his aim is to</i>
<i>set up something there...</i>

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,777
Could it be...?

38
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:18,378
The Paper Bombs in the village
were a decoy?

39
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:23,381
You can't see the Paper Bombs
in this room?

40
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:28,561
What's this?!

41
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,624
What's up with these Paper Bombs?

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,225
Do you know the geological conditions

43
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:38,236
of the Great Stone Faces?

44
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:40,233
G Geological conditions...?

45
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,435
To be precise, the geological condition
of this plateau

46
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,374
which the Great Stone Faces
are carved into.

47
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,038
The plateau towering behind
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

48
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,345
is made of extremely hard rock.

49
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:55,785
But this rock has narrow lines
running through it, you see...

50
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,349
It can be easily broken if power
is applied along those lines.

51
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:05,252
The Great Stone Faces
were created using this...

52
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:08,366
This time and thirty years ago

53
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,129
aren't the only times I've come
to the Leaf...

54
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:14,835
I've visited the Leaf several times
and checked things out...

55
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,776
And then I finally determined it...

56
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:23,743
I determined how to set Paper Bombs
to destroy this plateau!

57
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,917
Wha?!

58
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,284
<i>I'm fairly certain</i>
<i>no one would imagine</i>

59
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,116
<i>the destruction of</i>
<i>the Great Stone Faces...</i>

60
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:30,848
<i>Especially when</i>

61
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:32,686
<i>we're in the middle of Paper Bomb</i>
<i>removal operations.</i>

62
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,086
<i>We wouldn't even think</i>
<i>about the Great Stone Faces...</i>

63
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:40,592
<i>But if that entire plateau were</i>
<i>to slide down and crumble...</i>

64
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:43,398
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

65
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,845
would be completely buried
in earth and sand!

66
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,083
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

67
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,758
It would be destroyed!

68
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,621
Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage
immediately!

69
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:18,333
Make sure the guys who return
don't enter the village...

70
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,936
Shikamaru, be happy!

71
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,110
Guy Sensei and the others
have come back!

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,779
Hurry, hurry!
Now that Might Guy has returned,

73
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,318
we won't let the enemy do
as he pleases!

74
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,255
Too late, huh...?

75
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:38,390
What's the matter...?

76
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,993
Shikamaru!

77
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,428
Naruto has...!

78
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:48,526
Why? Why destroy
the whole village...?

79
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,595
If you do that,
many innocent people will die.

80
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,506
And all the buildings you built
will be destroyed.

81
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,802
Is that what you want?!

82
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:05,880
You may think revenge is
your last job or whatever,

83
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:08,147
but something like
this is absolutely mistaken.

84
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,990
If you're going to go through
with this no matter what...

85
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,193
I'll stop you!

86
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:19,431
That's impossible.

87
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,524
No way will I let you detonate
the Paper Bombs!

88
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:27,597
Nope. I won from the moment
you set foot in here.

89
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,230
Even if you defeat me,

90
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:33,039
the triggering device will activate
the instant you leave this place.

91
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,955
It seems everyone has returned...

92
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,600
I guess I'll be activating
the triggring device...

93
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,767
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
shall meet

94
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,537
the same fate as Heat Devil Village!

95
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,837
I won't let that happen!

96
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,847
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

97
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:10,716
It's over!

98
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,384
It's useless to resist...

99
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:22,226
It's impossible for you alone
to disarm all of my traps.

100
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:27,857
No doubt, it might be impossible
for me alone...

101
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,401
but I've got friends!

102
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:37,276
But didn't you do nothing
but badmouth them at Ichiraku?

103
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:42,239
Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot
and they tick me off sometimes...

104
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,439
But they're my friends!

105
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,878
They're Shinobi
who will protect the Leaf with me!

106
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,416
No matter what traps you set...

107
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,892
they'll manage somehow,
no matter what!

108
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:58,655
Then, I'll finish everything before that.

109
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:00,590
You won't be able to stop them this time!

110
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,135
Fang Over Fang...!

111
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:08,340
I'd say that was a close shave, huh?

112
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,636
Kiba! Akamaru!
How'd you know I was here?

113
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,106
Thank Hinata!

114
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,106
She thought it was strange that
you'd leave for no reason,

115
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,345
so she frantically searched
for you with her Byakugan.

116
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:24,415
But the Byakugan shouldn't
be that versatile...

117
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,858
I'm surprised you found us...

118
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,221
Well, we had a pretty good idea
of where you were...

119
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:34,965
Shikamaru said that the final trap
would be in the Great Stone Faces.

120
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,568
Shikamaru did...?

121
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,237
I see...

122
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:42,563
This means I shouldn't take
young opponents lightly, huh...?

123
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,174
Right. You misjudged our power...

124
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,612
Th These are... insects?!

125
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,475
That's right...
You're finished now.

126
00:08:57,924 --> 00:08:58,948
Get down, you two!

127
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:05,364
Old man...

128
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,692
He blew himself up!

129
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,727
No, that's not it!

130
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,070
It's a Substitution...

131
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:16,500
It seems he switched just before
being covered with the insects...

132
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:26,877
It's over now...

133
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,986
Wh What's this...?

134
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,327
It's the Shadow Strangle Jutsu...

135
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,299
You anticipated my actions...?

136
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:46,001
Yup. Checkmate, old man.
Come on right over here...

137
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,639
Choji, restrain him.

138
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,115
Got it...

139
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:00,746
Oh, shoot! His shadow...!

140
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
Shikamaru... What did he do...?

141
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:07,051
He had set it so a smoke screen
would activate

142
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,923
if he were touched by an enemy.

143
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:10,751
Choji, to the right!

144
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,692
Human Boulder!

145
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,734
The Leaf is now finished!

146
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,335
A strike?

147
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,238
Why won't...
the Paper Bomb explode?

148
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:26,939
Tough luck...

149
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,044
We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.

150
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:33,413
And we disarmed all
the triggering devices

151
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,612
set inside the Great Stone Faces.

152
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:38,847
This is as far as you go old man...

153
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:41,622
That's right...
Prepare yourself!

154
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,255
It's useless to run!

155
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,097
I don't know how incredible of
a Trapper you are.

156
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,931
But my friends' teamwork
is better than you are!

157
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,839
I must not give up here...

158
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:56,899
Give up, already!

159
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:00,301
No matter what you set up,
we'll stop it!

160
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:04,076
I wouldn't be able...
to show my face to my son...

161
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:10,956
Where'd he...?

162
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,457
Over there!

163
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:17,494
It seems you haven't disarmed
all of the triggering devices...

164
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,798
I... win!

165
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:38,650
The village!

166
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:44,447
Don't be fooled, guys!
This is a Genjutsu!

167
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:46,858
Release!

168
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:49,594
Naruto!

169
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,120
Huh? Wh-What?

170
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,071
Summoning Jutsu!

171
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,540
He's planning to get on that bird
and escape!

172
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,877
Leave it to me!

173
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:07,710
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

174
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,544
All right! It's a success...

175
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,616
- Ino...!
- Hey!

176
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,159
Why'd you break the Jutsu?!

177
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:25,630
What's the matter?

178
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,561
His body... It really hurt...

179
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:35,867
He's fighting while enduring
a lot of pain in his body!

180
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:40,879
I won't let you escape!

181
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,002
Naruto...

182
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:05,564
Sure enough...

183
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:10,166
I'm no match for a young person
at Taijutsu, huh...?

184
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,141
It's not like that...

185
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:16,914
You're a quite the practitioner
of Taijutsu...

186
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:19,817
Now it's finally over!

187
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:22,519
It's not over yet...

188
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:23,989
What?

189
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:26,956
What do you mean...
it's not over yet?

190
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,292
Where's the bird he summoned earlier?

191
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:32,364
Oh! Over there!

192
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,365
There are Paper Bombs on its feet!

193
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:41,706
What?!

194
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:46,002
The Mountainside Image of
the Third Hokage is the spot

195
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,943
where I restored a crack...

196
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:52,184
I used a device different
from the others...

197
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:58,387
That cracked section is slightly
more fragile than the other areas...

198
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,785
I set an triggering device
that takes advantage of that...

199
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:05,361
If there an explosion occurs there,

200
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:10,892
the other Paper Bombs
will explode at once.

201
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:13,565
Going so far as to set a device
in such a place...

202
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,100
To think we overlooked that...!

203
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:21,703
That means he summoned
that bird to activate the device?!

204
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:27,110
At last... my wish will come true...

205
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,587
Here it comes!

206
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:29,888
I'll use this...

207
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,027
It dodged them!

208
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,987
We can't bring it down with
a long range attack?!

209
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,898
I'll defend the Leaf,
no matter what!

210
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:48,437
I'll blow him away with the Rasengan
before he slams into this place!

211
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,435
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

212
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:54,346
What?!

213
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:56,114
What?!

214
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:01,885
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
Both arms!

215
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:05,322
Naruto, use my hands!

216
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,389
Thanks, Choji!

217
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:13,893
H-Hinata?!

218
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:19,034
U -Umm... Shikamaru told me to read
that bird's movements

219
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,629
with my Byakugan
and to give you directions...

220
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,041
Huh?

221
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,572
I leave the rest to you!

222
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:26,876
All right, let's go, Hinata!

223
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:28,971
R-Right!

224
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:31,549
Byakugan!

225
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:35,680
Not yet... Draw it closer...

226
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:37,856
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

227
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:39,956
<i>No matter what,</i>

228
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,927
<i>I'll protect the village the Third Hokage</i>
<i>risked his life to protect!</i>

229
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:46,558
Naruto... Now!

230
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:50,035
Rasengan!

231
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:51,503
It vanished?!

232
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,737
Up above!

233
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:56,302
Damn it. Reach!

234
00:15:57,743 --> 00:15:59,870
You little!

235
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,954
What? Did something happen...?

236
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,453
All right!

237
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:25,700
Yes! We did it, Hinata!

238
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,937
N -Naruto...

239
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,137
The inside of his body
is in terrible shape...

240
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,609
It's amazing that he lived until today.

241
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,255
Old man...

242
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:51,428
It's too bad...
I failed to leave my name in history...

243
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:55,829
But... I had... fun...

244
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:57,602
What?

245
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,605
What do you mean, old man?!

246
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,841
What do you mean you had fun?!

247
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:11,947
Old Man Genno!

248
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,089
<i>Naruto?</i>
<i>No, it's not...</i>

249
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:28,323
<i>"My son proud as a peacock having</i>
<i>beaten me at treasure hunting... "

250
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,069
<i>Treasure hunting... ?

251
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,405
Did you notice?

252
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,806
Huh?

253
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,999
The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty
in this incident...

254
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:46,417
Old Man Genno!
Open your eyes!

255
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,913
Old Man Genno!!

256
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,056
I figured it out, Shikamaru...

257
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:59,462
It seems the person in this picture
is Genno's real son...

258
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,099
Son...?

259
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,224
It seems he became
a Shinobi like his father...

260
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:09,138
but lost his life right after that
when the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village.

261
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,802
I bet he wanted to avenge his own son...

262
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:17,280
So he did something like this...

263
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,053
No doubt, at first he may have
infiltrated the village for revenge...

264
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:25,723
At first...?

265
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,591
Something was kind of bugging me,

266
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,026
so I checked out the triggering device
that was set in the Academy

267
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:32,586
one more time.

268
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:36,625
There was a loose connection
in one spot.

269
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,503
It was set up so it wouldn't activate
even if the target were hit...

270
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,504
Wasn't that just Genno's mistake...?

271
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,340
Genno was a first rate Trapper.

272
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,679
It's unlikely he'd make such
a simple mistake...

273
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,218
No doubt about it...

274
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,045
The same goes for the traps in
the Great Stone Faces...

275
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,281
There were some defective bombs
mixed in with the Paper Bombs.

276
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,591
Even if the traps were activated,

277
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:06,927
there's a strong possibility that

278
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:08,899
they'd only make a few cracks
in the Great Stone Faces.

279
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:15,505
Then he had no serious intention
of smashing the Leaf?

280
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,804
Then... for what purpose...?

281
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:24,382
Treasure hunting...

282
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,619
What do you mean treasure hunting?

283
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,220
It makes more sense
to think of it like that.

284
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:37,821
In other words, he infiltrated
the village for the sake of revenge,

285
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:40,364
but he changed his mind
after meeting Naruto

286
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:41,763
who was a spitting image
of his son...

287
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:48,098
He probably knew that
he didn't have long to live.

288
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:51,535
If he was going to do something
before dying,

289
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,202
he wanted it to be
the thing he found most fun...

290
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,807
He probably wanted to re enact
his treasure hunts with his son...

291
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:01,318
using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.

292
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,321
So that's what it was.

293
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:07,383
Well, it's just conjecture, though.

294
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:11,089
So that old man...
wasn't a bad person...

295
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:12,962
I told you from the start.

296
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:17,195
Those who like Ichiraku's ramen
can't be bad people!

297
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:21,471
What? But in actuality,
didn't he hate ramen?

298
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,908
Ichiraku ramen is different!

299
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:30,475
There's no way you can keep
eating something you hate every day.

300
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:31,816
Exactly!

301
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:38,356
Old man...

302
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,326
Naruto?

303
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:50,458
The enemies who come to the Leaf
won't always be like this.

304
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:55,066
Someone like Orochimaru
might attack again!

305
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:59,007
That means we must
always be prepared!

306
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:00,878
Right!

307
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:03,909
It's a pain, though...

308
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:07,213
I'll eat in preparation for that!

309
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,219
We'll protect the Leaf Village!

310
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:15,893
With all of us working together...

311
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:44,319
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

312
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,823
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

313
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:51,329
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

314
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,459
<i>Suggestively</i>

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,266
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

316
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:05,876
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

317
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:12,440
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

318
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:17,477
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

319
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:22,653
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

320
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:52,718
Thank you all for your support!

321
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:54,519
We're going to fill the airwaves
with our appreciation...

322
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:55,992
We've even called on someone
who hasn't been in the show recently

323
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:57,289
to make a guest appearance!

324
00:22:57,362 --> 00:23:00,160
We're going to look back at
all the Ninja best battles!!

325
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:02,598
What? I'm not sure I understand,
but that sounds amazing!

326
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,225
Look forward to it! Cha!

327
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:05,667
By the way, who's our guest?

328
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:07,705
- It's a secret!
- You're not even going to tell me?!

329
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:12,406
Next Time: "The Top 5 Ninja Battles!"

330
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:14,843
There are also fun extras!

331
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,473
Tune in!
