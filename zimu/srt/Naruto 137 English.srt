1
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:16,867
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,463
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:26,303
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:29,575
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:33,780
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:40,155
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:45,529
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:49,124
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,503
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,506
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:59,874
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:02,342
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:08,216
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,957
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,289
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,160
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,425
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,967
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:27,402
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,657
<i>A Town of Outlaws!</i>
<i>The Shadow of the Fuma Clan</i>

21
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:51,018
It seems that the most bustling traveler's
town in the Land of Rice Paddies

22
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:52,620
is at the bottom of these mountains.

23
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:55,023
You're going to weird places again

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,500
in the name of investigation,
aren't you, Pervy Sage?!

25
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,429
Please stop it already!

26
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,468
We had a rough time shaking
off the bodyguards from the rip off bar.

27
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,537
I understand your point,

28
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:13,448
but there's no other way to find
Village Hidden in the Sound.

29
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,416
Gee, I don't like it either, but...

30
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:19,483
This is truly a problem...

31
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,493
But we have to do things
we don 't like... R ight?!

32
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:26,557
Okay, let's go!

33
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:29,361
Naruto, Sakura,
don 't drag your feet!

34
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:33,966
Investigation, investigation!
What a pain.

35
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,663
He looks like he's having fun.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,135
He hasn 't learned at all.

37
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,642
Fuma A lley

38
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,687
- Oww!
- That's my line!

39
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:57,859
This is even rougher than
the traveler's town before.

40
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,427
Let's just take a pass on this place
and find Village Hidden in the Sound.

41
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:15,544
Say...

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,773
I don't have any more money.

43
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,210
I don't have any more money either!

44
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:21,316
Here!

45
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:24,818
You guys go get some food with that

46
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,948
and wait in the temple
on the outskirts of town.

47
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,955
Information accumulates
in this kind of place,

48
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,467
but it's not good for you guys to see.

49
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,830
I'll sacrifice myself and check it out.

50
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,441
He's a surprisingly nice person...

51
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:50,878
Sakura... You're still so nave.

52
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,046
Where should I investigate first?

53
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,512
Gee, how rough...
Investigations are painful.

54
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,818
Let's leave the Pervy Sage be
and check somewhere else.

55
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:10,298
What's the matter, Sakura?

56
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,999
I don't think...
Sasuke's in this land anymore.

57
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,137
What's the matter?!

58
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,008
We won't know that if
we don't investigate!

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,269
Yeah, but...

60
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,911
Our opponent is Orochimaru.

61
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,784
Of course, things might not go easily.

62
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,917
But you know...

63
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,221
But I'm sure we'll find him!

64
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:39,925
R ight.

65
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:43,962
Naruto!

66
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,173
You're... the one from before?!

67
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,602
This kid's... hurt...

68
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,213
You...?

69
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:59,012
Naruto!

70
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,474
Substitution, huh...?

71
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,943
We let them get away.

72
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,484
Don 't worry...

73
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:39,553
My cute children
are making a silver trail for us.

74
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,452
They can't escape from us now...

75
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:50,234
It seems those two are
petty Ninja from somewhere.

76
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:53,236
But getting involved with us
has sealed their fate.

77
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:54,698
It's unfortunate for them...

78
00:05:55,373 --> 00:06:00,174
The objective of those who sneak into
this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,163
Sure enough, the skin of
a young woman is supple.

80
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,294
You're mean!

81
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,301
Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.

82
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:34,173
By the way, have you guys heard
rumors about the Sound Village?

83
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,610
The Sound Village?

84
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,572
I've never heard the name
of such a village.

85
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,444
I'll tip you handsomely if you tell me.

86
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:46,085
But I really don 't know.

87
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,918
I've never heard of it.

88
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,355
I've heard of it!

89
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,727
One of my regulars knows
a lot about it.

90
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,195
Wanna come?

91
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:58,730
Yeah.

92
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:02,463
His home is in the back of this alley.

93
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,356
Trapped like a rat.

94
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:28,894
What, it's a seedy old man!
Hey! He's got money, right?

95
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,802
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.

96
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:38,097
You punks! Stop the idle chatter
and take care of him now!

97
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,665
R ight, boss!

98
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,744
Getting infatuated with girls has sealed
your fate! Rest in peace!

99
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:08,906
Ninja A rt:
Needle Jizo.

100
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:12,936
You punk...

101
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm in a hurry...

102
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,045
I think it'd be best if you
answer compliantly

103
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:26,455
whether or not you know
about Hidden Sound Village.

104
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:31,621
You're a fool if I look like
a compliant person to you!

105
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:33,960
You a Ninja?

106
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,393
If so?

107
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,697
Interesting!

108
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:42,170
We've reduced ourselves to
being thieves,

109
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,676
but we're a somewhat
famous Shinobi clan around here!

110
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:50,046
Instead of taking your life,
I could hire you if you want!

111
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,648
A Ninja, huh...

112
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,550
Then I don't need to go easy on you.

113
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,257
Don 't be acting like a big shot, old man!

114
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,694
Shut up, you squirt!

115
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,458
A Ninja refers to one who endures.

116
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,564
Those who couldn 't endure
their hunger pangs

117
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:14,401
and resort to use their diligently
studied Jutsu for stealing

118
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,565
are not called Ninja!

119
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:18,705
I won't let that pass!

120
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,978
Thinking we're fellow Shinobi,
we took pity on you.

121
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,741
Acting all conceited!

122
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,275
R egret after being sliced in two!

123
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,921
Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!

124
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,231
R asengan!

125
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:57,978
You punk! How dare you
do that to the boss!

126
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,376
We won't let you do
any more than that!

127
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,177
Oh?

128
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,344
Hold it, you guys!

129
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,292
I didn't know you were so good!

130
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:19,927
That Jutsu just now...

131
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:23,264
I sense you must be
a person of stature!

132
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,969
If it's all right,
may I ask you your name?

133
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:33,648
If you don't know, then I shall tell you!

134
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:40,017
Women become infatuated
with his sex appeal.

135
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,559
He's strong against Shinobi,
but has a soft spot for women!

136
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,221
He ex. Ists in V illage Hidden in the Leaves...

137
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,090
And made his name known...

138
00:10:56,607 --> 00:11:02,443
Master Jiraiya, that's me!

139
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:05,605
What?!

140
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,419
You guys bow your heads
and beg for your lives!

141
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,751
We'll all be killed!

142
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:15,091
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

143
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:20,160
Although we didn't know,
being so rude to Master Jiraiya,

144
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:23,758
reputed as one of the Legendary
Sannin of the Leaf Village!

145
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:27,530
We beg for your forgiveness!

146
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:32,408
So my name's known in this land, too...

147
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,307
Well, it's okay.

148
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:39,514
So is it true that you know about
Village Hidden in the Sound?

149
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,817
Yes! There were many Ninja clans
in the Land of Rice Paddies,

150
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,015
including us Fuma.

151
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:48,959
We divided up the roles
amongst ourselves

152
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:52,962
and the Ninja of this land
were doing well in their own way.

153
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,589
Until that man appeared...

154
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,069
Who was that man?

155
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,532
It's regrettable to even speak
of that name...

156
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:08,434
It was Orochimaru!

157
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,493
It's okay! Rest easy!

158
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:29,391
If germs get into the wound
and you get tetanus,

159
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,525
you won't be saved.

160
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:34,734
But fortunately, I have medicine,
so let me treat you.

161
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:37,836
They're not coming.

162
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,869
Just show us your wound.

163
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:47,075
Well, huh?

164
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,722
Naruto, go wait outside
till my treatment is done.

165
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:54,516
Huh?

166
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:04,666
W hy do I have to be
the only one chased out?!

167
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,803
Jeez!

168
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,272
I guess it can't be helped.

169
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,106
Don 't peek!

170
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,718
I know.

171
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:30,991
Okay, show me your wound.

172
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:54,341
How mean...

173
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,545
To hit me out of the blue...?

174
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,917
Whoa, interesting.

175
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,492
Naruto! Y ou can come in!

176
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:08,597
What?!

177
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:14,896
A cute girl?

178
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,741
Sakura! This girl!
Who the heck is this girl?!

179
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,939
How dense. It's the Ninja
from a moment ago.

180
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,384
Come to think of it...

181
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:38,384
Why...?

182
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,796
I am Sasame Fuma.

183
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:57,273
Sasame... Why were you being
chased by those guys?

184
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,376
If you like, try talking about it.

185
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,875
We might be able to help.

186
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:13,226
They were the Sound Ninja protecting
Orochimaru's residence.

187
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:14,355
What?!

188
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:19,162
I'm sorry for mistaking you guys as
one of them the other day.

189
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,863
That doesn't matter!

190
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,699
We're also looking for Orochimaru!

191
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:27,301
Would you please give us the details?

192
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:29,875
Okay...

193
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:34,749
It all started with the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Rice Paddies

194
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,946
launching an attack on
a neighboring land

195
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,420
in an attempt to expand the territory.

196
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,418
The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land...

197
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,259
And there aren't that many Shinobi.

198
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:50,767
It was a foolhardy attack.
Losing was expected...

199
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,701
And the Shinobi clans of this land

200
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:59,038
who participated in
the losing battle went to ruin...

201
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:03,604
We the Fuma Clan as well.

202
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:07,182
I hear that among
the surviving Shinobi,

203
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,445
there are those who have left the land

204
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,987
and those who have
stooped to become thieves.

205
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:14,818
Even so, we've lived believing
in a restoration of the clan

206
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,053
and continued to live hiding
in the shadows.

207
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:23,033
At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden
in the Sound appeared before us

208
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,537
attempting to create the first full scale
Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.

209
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:33,736
The emissary of
the Sound V illage said...

210
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:39,107
<i>My master Orochimaru is</i>
<i>gathering all sorts of Jutsu!</i>

211
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,483
<i>He has taken an interest</i>
<i>in your Jutsu well.</i>

212
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,812
<i>Depending on your work,</i>

213
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,084
<i>you might be given the chance</i>
<i>to serve the Feudal Lord!</i>

214
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:51,187
My cousin Arashi...

215
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,497
was an up and coming star
for the restoration of the clan...

216
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,760
Arashi as a representative of the clan

217
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,737
headed for Village Hidden in
the Sound together with the emissary.

218
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,004
But...

219
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:08,207
And then...?

220
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:14,677
We waited for a notice from Arashi, but...

221
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,145
There is no word from him, huh?

222
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:25,283
Damn it!
He was tricked by that Orochimaru!

223
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:26,192
Naruto!

224
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,094
Oh...!

225
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:35,304
Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi
might be safe...

226
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,339
We don't know, right?
And so... and so...

227
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,239
Idiot...!

228
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,844
I'm going to save Arashi!

229
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,214
I have a small body and
my power is weak.

230
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:48,849
So no matter what I did...

231
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,581
I did nothing but become a hindrance
even in Ninjutsu training...

232
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,418
But A rashi always saved me!

233
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,759
Everyone in the village has
already given up, but...

234
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,625
So I'll find Village Hidden
in the Sound alone...

235
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:07,100
A nd so you were chased by
the Sound Ninja, right?

236
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:10,837
This time, it's my turn to save Arashi!

237
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,734
Sasame!

238
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:19,211
I... I want to be of help to Arashi!

239
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:21,952
Naruto!

240
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,214
Yeah... I know!

241
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,420
W e have to go to V illage of the Sound
to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!

242
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:32,785
Now instead of one,

243
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,093
it's just that there are two guys
for us to bring back.

244
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,033
I'll save your cousin, Sasame!

245
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:46,407
R ight!

246
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,107
Eew! A spider...

247
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,675
What's this?!

248
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:02,688
Naruto!

249
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,860
Wha! What's this?!

250
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,600
Ninja A rt: W ind Spiders!

251
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:16,964
My cute children made a path
for me out of silver thread

252
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,738
and told me where you guys
were going.

253
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:29,211
All three of you together will descend
into hell while bearing the secret!

254
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,926
Naruto! It 's the V entriloquism Jutsu!

255
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,257
He's scatteringthis voice
to multiple directions

256
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,320
and covering up location and number!

257
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,501
I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!

258
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,834
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

259
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:03,453
Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!

260
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,318
It's a large number,
but it's just Clone Jutsu.

261
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,223
No. Look closely, Jigumo!

262
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,657
The threads are getting tangled.

263
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,898
All of the clones are tangible?!
Shadow clones?!

264
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:21,136
If so... Kagero!

265
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,832
Understood...

266
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:25,898
Come out!

267
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:34,348
Borne to be born, lived to live,
one sunrise and one sunset...

268
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,315
The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.

269
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:42,381
Thinking that such a fleeting life
is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable...

270
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:44,318
K now that I'm at my best

271
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:48,160
when living in the dark and
deep in the ground!

272
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,328
Ninja A rt:

273
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:55,638
Ant Lion Jutsu!

274
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:28,298
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

275
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:34,675
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

276
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:45,246
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

277
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:55,022
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

278
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:01,761
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

279
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:11,071
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

280
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:22,784
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

281
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

282
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,980
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

283
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:53,887
Darn it! W hat a pesky bunch!

284
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,886
But I won 't be done in so easily!

285
00:22:57,995 --> 00:23:01,431
I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk's butt

286
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:04,956
and bring back Sasuke and
Sasame's cousin!

287
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:08,094
It doesn't matter if you guys
are powerhouses!

288
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:12,502
I'll kick all of your butts,
so bring it on from anywhere!
