1
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,829
You must use of the techniques using the head…

2
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,670
… otherwise he will be your adversary to use of you.

3
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,979
And then scemotto…

4
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,086
… it makes me the favor not falling
in obvious traps cos  ?.

5
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,361
The ninja they must anticipate the adversary!

6
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,414
I know anch' ' ste things!

7
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:54,313
Instead he is because you do not know to them that you I say.

8
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:55,812
Understood?

9
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,090
The movements are mistake to you for via of your impulsività.

10
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,466
Arrived E' my opportunity.

11
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,667
Finally it is uncovered!

12
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,132
Just six…

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Waaah! You have centered!

14
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:17,286
Sasuke, wretch! You have exaggerated!

15
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,630
Maledizione! Of new the technique of the substitution!

16
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,809
From my attack it will have understood my position!

17
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,725
It has made feint to lower the guard!

18
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:39,140
They have fallen in its trap like a cretino!

19
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:46,497
Sasuke… where six!

20
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:49,001
Already it will not have been put
outside combat from the sensei!

21
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,616
Not! It will not never happen to Sasuke!

22
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:57,302
For a hair it is not shrewed of me!

23
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:59,423
Sakura, behind of you.

24
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,970
Eh!

25
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:09,265
"the ninja they must know to anticipate the adversary"?

26
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:13,674
That anger! I swear that not cadr ò  never more in one its trap!

27
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,221
Like not dettooo!

28
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:27,703
Bocciati? The decision of Kakashi!

29
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:50,185
Eh? Eh!

30
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,361
Cos' has happened!

31
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,445
Dov' is…

32
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:53,388
… the Sensei?

33
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,180
What has happened?

34
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,419
But that…

35
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,213
I do not understand!

36
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,729
Sakura…

37
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,110
Sasuke-kun?

38
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,056
Know. Sakura… To. Aiu.. Helps Me…

39
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:19,789
Perhaps I have exaggerated a pochino.

40
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,207
But it had to hold account if he were real or less.

41
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,738
That urlo…it was of Sakura.

42
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,168
According to foundation of the combats of a ninja,
it is that one of the Genjutsu.(Illusory Limbs)

43
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,882
The Sakura small is falled easy.

44
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:38,416
Genjutsu, eh? One risen of ipnotismo.

45
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,020
It does not astonish to me that with she it has worked.

46
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,391
For ò…

47
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,405
I am various from they.

48
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:51,851
Pits in you I would wait for to say it after to have taken a door-bell.

49
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,900
Sasuke-kun.

50
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,649
E' useless to try of the direct attacks!

51
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,046
One trap!

52
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:32,382
What!

53
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,848
But you it watches.!

54
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,529
That bastard! It does not leave me…

55
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,518
… the time not to read "the Paradise of the Pomiciata".

56
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,684
Uh? But that…

57
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:10,939
Hour memory! Sasuke-kun was in end of life and I…

58
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,699
Sasuke-kun! Not to die! Not to leave me!

59
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,834
Where seiii!

60
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:27,451
It watches that one looks at hung a tree…

61
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:34,626
There is from eating on that stone!

62
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:39,364
The ninja they must anticipate the adversary…

63
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:46,138
All adding I must say that various six from the others two.

64
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,975
Horse!

65
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,264
Tiger!

66
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,586
Katon Goukakyuu not Jutsu
(Technical of the Supreme Fire Ball)

67
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:55,618
What!

68
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:58,268
That one is one technical that a Genin
it would not have to succeed to use…

69
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:00,626
In theory it must not have the chakra sufficient!

70
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:16,523
Not there is!

71
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,307
Dov' is escaped!

72
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,335
Of side!

73
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:20,382
Up!

74
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:21,723
They are here under.

75
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,561
Thing.?

76
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,726
Doton Shinjuuzanshu not Jutsu!
(Element Earth: Decapitation kills)

77
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:39,417
The third foundation of the combats
of a Ninja it is the Ninjutsu. (magical limbs)

78
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,399
How you are? You cannot move, true?

79
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:46,401
I must admit that…

80
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:50,368
… you six fact to be worth.

81
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,752
Even if…

82
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,303
… one says that to caval that better it pulls,
toccan it gets worse to them scudiciate.

83
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,734
Eternal damnation!

84
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,316
Also without to me it are earned honestly it
taking a door-bell, I can eat the same one!

85
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,476
Good appetite!

86
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,238
Ehi!

87
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,734
I was alone joking.

88
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,195
Too much late!

89
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:22,035
Merda, is too much difference between of we.

90
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,659
Sakura.

91
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:38,131
It has cut the testaaa!

92
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,548
But that it takes to it?

93
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,017
Sasuke-kun?

94
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,720
But then six alive one!

95
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,224
Mollami!

96
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,958
It lacks little to noon.

97
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,952
I go.

98
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:08,712
Sasuke-kun, you still have intention
to take those door-bells!

99
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:11,862
Little ago I have grazes them to you,
the next time to take them ò.

100
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:12,617
Eh!

101
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,863
Indeed.?

102
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:17,453
Fantastic E' Sasuke-kun.

103
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,187
Maledizione! I not to never succeed ò
to take one of those door-bells.

104
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,959
Risk of having to separate to me from Sasuke-kun!

105
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:32,131
For ò, you know, by now not is more time

106
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:35,835
Even if this time ce we have not made it,
the next one you will see that it will go better.

107
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,832
Only I…

108
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,673
… I can kill that man.

109
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,186
Eh?

110
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:09,750
But who?

111
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,600
It speaks about the Sensei!

112
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,892
That time…

113
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,196
… cried.

114
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,885
Pianse..?

115
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,991
But…

116
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:25,163
… about that it speaks?

117
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,312
I am a vendicatore.

118
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,272
I must become more strongly than he.

119
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:34,362
I cannot be stopped now.

120
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,411
I want to kill…

121
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,361
… who I know.

122
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:46,896
Eternal damnation. We have wasted time speaking.

123
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,277
Sasuke-kun…

124
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:02,149
You feel you feel like brontolano your bellies.

125
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,474
I wanted dirvi that, considered this practice…

126
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:10,240
… nobody of you will have to return to the Academy of the ninja.

127
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:16,236
How? But I am alone svenuta…

128
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:18,347
Went well the same one?

129
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,739
The love always wins!

130
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,536
And you go!

131
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,420
YAH!!!

132
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,911
Then…

133
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:27,940
… it wants to say that we three…

134
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,292
Exact one. I want that you three…

135
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,005
… you stop of being of the ninja!

136
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,693
In… incredible…

137
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:49,397
It has not promoted neanche one student?

138
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,766
Iruka…

139
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:58,276
It will not be cos ì  if those three will have to become of the ninja effective.

140
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:02,625
The decision of Kakashi always has been corrected.

141
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,591
To stop of being ninja! What you would want to say!

142
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:07,377
I admit! True E'…

143
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,933
We are not resolutions to take the door-bell!

144
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,669
But because we would have quite
to stop of being ninja!

145
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:18,659
Why you are all of the inadatti plump children
to this profession.

146
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,941
Sasuke!

147
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,305
E' for that I say that you are of the pivelli.

148
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:32,482
Not to tread on Sasuke-kun!!!

149
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,876
But that idea you are made of the trade of ninja?

150
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:48,163
According to you because you have been uniforms
in groups for this practice?

151
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:50,481
What you would want to say?

152
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,357
In practical…

153
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:56,225
… you have not understood null
of the solution of this examination.

154
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,087
The solution!

155
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:02,849
Exact one. The solution that marks the outcome of the examination.

156
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:07,216
We thought that he was…

157
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,360
Stupiden…

158
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,475
You are stupid or what?

159
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:14,918
Understood because you are not in a group?

160
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,033
What enters there…

161
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,795
… that three persons are in group!

162
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,035
E'…

163
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,873
… THE SQUARE JOB.

164
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,238
It says to cooperate between of we?

165
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,916
Just cos ì.

166
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,786
But by now it is late although hour of it you have conscience.

167
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:35,032
You would even have taken the door-bells
if you had attacked to me in three.

168
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:37,556
But you have mistaken.

169
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,638
It waits for a moment…

170
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,951
Like it is made to head at the square job,
when ce two of door-bells are alone!

171
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:46,929
Even if we had tried to take the door-bells
with all our forces, one would be remained outside!

172
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,555
Other that square job!
There would be puttinges to litigate!

173
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,319
Sure!

174
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:54,838
The attempt of this examination is just that one makes you to litigate.

175
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:56,527
What!

176
00:13:56,527 --> 00:14:00,446
In this way, we select those more capacities to the square job…

177
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:03,632
… that it does not give importance to the personal gain.

178
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:06,037
This was the objective…

179
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,367
For ò  you have made tutt' other.

180
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,366
Sakura…

181
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,565
You instead thinking next to Naruto that you had in front of you…

182
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:16,460
… you had in mind single Sasuke although you did not know neanche where it was.

183
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:18,738
Naruto!

184
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:21,350
You six rashly launch to the attack alone.

185
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:27,804
While you, Sasuke, have made the same game hermit
because convinced that the others two were only a weight.

186
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,929
A mission is executed with the entire group!

187
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:33,161
True E' that to a ninja serves…

188
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:36,097
… ability characterizes them advanced…

189
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:37,914
… but the square job assumes greater importance.

190
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:43,953
The individualismo that corrupts the square job
it puts in danger the companions, ending with killing them.

191
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:45,510
As an example…

192
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:50,850
Sakura! You kill Naruto or morirà Sasuke!

193
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,343
And it goes to end cos ì…

194
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:01,562
Oh! That fright…

195
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:07,434
… that you must take one impossible choice after that has taken to you
a hostage. And this door to the dead women of someone.

196
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:12,150
The rischiosi missions are job!

197
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,602
Watched here…

198
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:20,732
… all these names affected this slab…

199
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:24,984
… they belong to the ninja that in this
village comes calls heroes to you.

200
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:29,558
It appeals to to me! It appeals to to me!

201
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:32,992
Hour that I know it, I want to record my name…

202
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,404
… on that stone!

203
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:37,915
A hero! A hero! S ì, diventer ò  a hero!

204
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,420
For ò… whichever are not heroes.

205
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,294
Ah not! And that type of heroes is?

206
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:49,942
Then! Which heroes are?

207
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,388
Those who is said K.I.A.

208
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,153
K.I.A.?

209
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,506
Heroes Died in Mission.

210
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,113
This is one lapide.

211
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:13,427
Also the name of my better friend is recorded here over.

212
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,171
Hour…

213
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,713
… to give ?  a last possibility to you.

214
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:34,146
For ò  in the afternoon the fight for
the door-bells will be still more hard!

215
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:36,082
This challenge will eat only who chip ax.

216
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,332
But…

217
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,650
… dates not to eat to Naruto.

218
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:44,850
E' the penance in order to have tried to eat
alone going against the rules.

219
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,059
If the dates to eat…

220
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,036
… I disqualify to you from the examination.

221
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,123
Here the rules I them make…

222
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,040
Clearly?

223
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,133
Me excuses…

224
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,599
It listens, Iruka.

225
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:09,272
It does not import the result, not to take it to you with Kakashi.

226
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,438
S ì.

227
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:29,333
I am very well even if I do not eat!

228
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,906
I am very well!

229
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,509
…

230
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,956
Prendi.

231
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,565
Ehi..! Sasuke-kun!…

232
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,626
The Sensei has said to us…

233
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:51,323
Not to worry, I do not feel more to you its presence.

234
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,434
In the afternoon we will go to take the door-bells in three.

235
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:58,233
To empty stomach me it would be only of weight.

236
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,711
Sasuke-kun…

237
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,418

Cos ì  you do not have yourself to be worried.

244
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,612

00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:37,805

248
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,500
Only for this time.

You are ready for the punishment?

"a ninja he must know to anticipate the movements of the adversary"

275
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:24,882
In the world of the ninja, who does not respect
the rules come considered feccia.

276
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:27,216
For ò…

277

For ò  the only one that we will accept it will be protect this old one.

295
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:02,308
It jokes on me, laughing to me in face
and saying that I have the face from idiot.

296
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:04,444
It must decide.
