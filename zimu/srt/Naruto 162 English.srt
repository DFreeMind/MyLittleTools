1
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:21,697
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:26,507
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,139
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:36,345
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:46,263
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:55,634
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:06,416
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:15,892
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:21,023
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:11,312
What is it?

12
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:37,974
Who are you?!

13
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:57,693
It was you...?
You killed him, didn't you?

14
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,222
N-No... I don't know anything...!

15
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:17,748
The Cursed Warrior...?

16
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,384
<i>The Cursed Warrior</i>

17
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:35,723
Old man's... snot!

18
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:42,671
I just can't get myself into
training doing it alone...

19
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,277
I wonder if we won't get a mission
connected to Sasuke or something.

20
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:59,917
The Land of Birds?
From such a remote land...

21
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,326
That's what's troubling us.

22
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:07,423
The "Cursed Warrior" apparition has been
disturbing the castle town

23
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,263
and misleading the public, huh?

24
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,868
So they want us to exterminate a ghost?

25
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:16,369
I declined once saying
we can't go so far

26
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,002
as to accept the extermination
of a ghost, but...

27
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:32,355
I must have you accept this at any cost.
Please accept!

28
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,724
Is it because the money isn't enough?

29
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,364
We in the Land of Birds are
experiencing financial difficulties.

30
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,961
Even this is the very limit
the budget will allow...

31
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,967
It's not an issue of money.

32
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:51,305
In other words,
it's the mission details.

33
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,070
Be that as it may,

34
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:57,240
indeed there isn't even enough to
cover travel expenses with this amount...

35
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,082
Now that things have come
to this pass...

36
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,611
I shall commit harakiri...!

37
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:04,154
Don't be hasty!

38
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,687
Yikes!

39
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,794
It's the little bit of pocket money
I have saved up.

40
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:22,035
I'll pay out of my own pocket.
So with this, please...!

41
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,675
And that's why you accepted it?

42
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,276
It's indulgent even for me...

43
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:39,784
Nonetheless, most of the
Jonin and Chunin are out on missions.

44
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,351
I was thinking of how to handle this...

45
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,762
I guess someone's talking about you.

46
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,767
Everyone's busy with missions,
so they don't have time for such things.

47
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,811
Who's that guy...?

48
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:08,318
He's been like that since earlier.

49
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,230
Even tasty ramen won't go down the throat
right being watched like that!

50
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,228
Come inside and eat if you're hungry!

51
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:25,263
No, I'm not hungry...

52
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:43,121
So? Tasty, huh?

53
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:45,081
Yes!

54
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:47,522
Thanks for your business.

55
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:49,561
Come back and have Naruto
treat you again...

56
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,690
Again and again like that?
Give me a break.

57
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,602
Thank you for treating me.
In appreciation...

58
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,639
N-No, you don't need to worry about it...

59
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,168
But hey, what's your name?

60
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,873
You're not a familiar face
from this village...

61
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,778
Yes, my name is Chishima and
I have come from the Land of Birds.

62
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,973
I came to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves to commission a mission...

63
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:16,449
You're flat broke even though
you came as a messenger of your land?

64
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,114
There wasn't enough money
for the commission,

65
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,988
so I even used up
my own pocket money...

66
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:24,594
Then it must be
a very important mission, huh?

67
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:29,593
It might even cost an important friend
of mine's very life...

68
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:33,427
Your friend...?
What the heck do you mean?

69
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,770
Ever since I was little,

70
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:41,370
I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord of the Land of Birds...

71
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,681
You're friends with a feudal lord?!

72
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,242
I said feudal lord,

73
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:50,982
but he was only just appointed last year
and actually he's the same age as me.

74
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:55,416
No kidding?
The he's a totally young feudal lord.

75
00:07:55,627 --> 00:08:01,623
Y Yes... The previous feudal lord,
his father Lord Owashi died from illness

76
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:05,401
and after that he even lost his twin sister...

77
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:07,430
Ever since then,

78
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:11,806
Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful,
has become a totally different person...

79
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,343
He wouldn't show his face
even if I visited...

80
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:22,385
I'm worried about him as
a friend rather than a feudal lord.

81
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:26,724
I was thinking something might
have happened to him...

82
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,320
So if there is something
I can do,

83
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,289
I want to do whatever I can,
as a friend...

84
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:40,069
<i>I couldn't...save Sasuke.</i>
<i>But this guy's still...</i>

85
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,334
Leave it to me.

86
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:43,266
What?

87
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's save your friend!

88
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,439
Right!

89
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:57,147
Old Lady Tsunade! You're mean!

90
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,790
Listen, you could at least knock
when entering my office.

91
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:07,398
More importantly! What do you mean
by fleecing bro of his pocket money

92
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,559
and then not accepting the mission?!

93
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:10,561
Huh?

94
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:15,798
People call stuff like that devilish!
You old lady devil!

95
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:19,333
Try saying that again!

96
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,841
I'm sorry!

97
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:29,320
I wonder if Naruto... is okay...

98
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:31,583
He'll be fine.

99
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:34,087
You've gotten to know a good guy...

100
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,391
He may not look it,
but he's quite dependable.

101
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:38,691
What?!

102
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,832
R-Right...

103
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:44,927
Who said I wouldn't accept the mission?

104
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji
to finish his mission and come back.

105
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,668
Half cocked jerk.

106
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:56,740
Lee is on a mission with Guy.

107
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:02,649
You and Tenten will form a three man team
with Neji as the leader, got it?

108
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:07,717
Then did you hear from that kid
about the mission details?

109
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,426
Well actually, not yet...

110
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,697
It's the extermination of a ghost.

111
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:17,560
A ghost?

112
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,865
It seems that it appears when
you're walking through town at night...

113
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,505
A ghost clad in white armor.

114
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:27,634
That's what you'II...

115
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:35,250
I I didn't hear anything about a ghost...

116
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,418
Are you scared of it?

117
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:41,717
I'm not scared. I couldn't be a Ninja
if I got scared at stuff like that!

118
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:48,859
But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?

119
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,632
Who knows...?

120
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,728
Try testing it out yourself.

121
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:09,516
Jeez, why didn't you say at the start

122
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:12,250
that it was a commission
to exterminate a ghost?!

123
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,257
I didn't tell you?

124
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:20,196
Not even a word.
But that's just a rumor anyway, right?

125
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,122
I haven't seen it, but...

126
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:24,099
See?

127
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,107
But it seems my master,
Lord Moso, saw it close up.

128
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,273
F-For real?!

129
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:35,478
The Land of Birds, huh...?
That's sure far...

130
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:43,843
Village Hidden in the Leaves

131
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,786
Land of Birds

132
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,165
Umm, is there more...?

133
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:37,141
You sure eat a lot considering
you're thin.

134
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:41,140
I'm sorry. I'm often called
a skinny voracious eater.

135
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:47,950
Hey, by the way, is there really such
a thing as the Cursed Warrior?

136
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:49,750
There are people who say

137
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:52,289
it's the disembodied spirit of
the previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.

138
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,491
The disembodied spirit of
a dead feudal lord...

139
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,062
Rather than ghosts,

140
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:02,259
tell us a little more about
the Land of Birds.

141
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,031
Sure...

142
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:07,731
The capitol of the Land of Birds
stretches across the banks of the lake

143
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,330
where migratory birds rest...

144
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,009
It was a peaceful town with
lots of green

145
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,479
and where water from the lake would
be drawn into the canals...

146
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:20,947
However, after the sudden death of
the previous feudal lord,

147
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,509
there was much uproar.

148
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:27,184
His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei,
the tactician from previously,

149
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,727
were nominated to be
the next feudal lord...

150
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,664
But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi
was still too young

151
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:36,360
and was vehemently opposed
to him assuming the feudal lordship.

152
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:40,662
But in the end, Lord Sagi
took the seat of feudal lord

153
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,105
and the matter was closed
with Moso the high priest

154
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:46,269
providing tutelage as
a superintendent official...

155
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:53,478
However, before even half
a year passed,

156
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,316
Lady Toki, his twin sister,
died suddenly...

157
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:08,192
After that, Lord Sagi
who was so cheerful

158
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,030
turned into a totally different person,
became coldhearted

159
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:15,162
and he now conducts governmental
matters confined in his mansion...

160
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:17,833
From about that time,

161
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:21,276
the Cursed Warrior began appearing
in the castle town...

162
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:27,008
Those in the castle town say
that Lord Owashi was killed by someone...

163
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,285
There are even those who say
that the Cursed Warrior

164
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,823
is the ghost of Lord Owashi
searching for the person

165
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,759
who drove him to death and is attempting
to have his revenge...

166
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:39,060
That's scary...

167
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,797
There's no such thing as ghosts.

168
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:44,599
But...

169
00:14:44,803 --> 00:14:47,328
That priest Moso is the one

170
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,066
who gained the most
from Owashi's death, huh...?

171
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:52,775
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
of virtue with no self interests!

172
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,503
Then the suspicious one is...

173
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,481
The only one left is Komei the tactician!

174
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,910
I bet he assassinated Owashi

175
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,750
in an attempt to become
the feudal lord, but failed!

176
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,385
He has complained whenever
opportunity offered itself,

177
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,154
after Lord Sagi became
the feudal lord as well!

178
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:12,158
A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi
by starting the rumor

179
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,631
about the Cursed Warrior might be
a piece of cake for Lord Komei...!

180
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,599
All right! There's no doubt.

181
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:22,364
It's settled. The true identity of
the Cursed Warrior is Komei!

182
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,543
The true identity of the ghost
is revealed, huh...?

183
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:49,126
Lord Komei, there was nothing unusual
on the scheduled patrol.

184
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,072
You may step down...

185
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,072
Yes, sire.

186
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,090
Aren't we at our destination yet?!

187
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,767
Just a little further until
Lord Moso's residence.

188
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,842
Where is he?! This way?

189
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:08,779
Where did he go?!

190
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,110
Th There he is!

191
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,313
Get him! Drag him down!

192
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:21,923
Cursed Warrior!

193
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:26,723
He vanished.

194
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,030
Lord Komei! Are you all right?!

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,895
I'm fine. Don't panic!

196
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:40,975
What's that?!

197
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:50,353
It's flying?!

198
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:57,261
Clad in white armor,
possesses a halberd,

199
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,693
and wears a mask with
a frightening look...

200
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:04,001
There's no doubt...
It's the Cursed Warrior!

201
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,265
After him!

202
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:09,740
Are you going to ride on
my shoulders forever?

203
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:13,772
Wait here! I'll pin down
the true identity of the ghost!

204
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,612
Huh? R-Right...

205
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:32,660
Where'd he go?!

206
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,661
Over there!

207
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:52,411
<i>Byakugan!</i>

208
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:03,489
I can't see him...

209
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,453
What does that mean?!

210
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:09,493
There's no human presence in here...

211
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:13,462
At least, a <i>living</i> presence...

212
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:17,174
Wh Why do you put it that way...?

213
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:20,007
Shh! Didn't you hear
something just now?

214
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,253
I thought you didn't feel
a human presence!

215
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:35,955
I told you... <i>living</i> presence.

216
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,367
Wh What do you want?!

217
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,130
Damn it, damn it.

218
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:49,739
You little!

219
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:54,707
Chain Weight!

220
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:12,526
Th -There can't be something like ghosts.
No such things as ghosts!

221
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,123
Stop, Naruto! He's...!

222
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,326
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

223
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:25,233
U!

224
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,833
Zu!

225
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,535
Ma!

226
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:27,168
Ki!

227
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,409
Naruto Barrage!

228
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,467
Yes! Now I'll verify the true identity!

229
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:56,235
This is...

230
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:03,075
The insides are empty.

231
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:06,507
That means...

232
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:13,052
it's a real ghost!

233
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:41,245
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

234
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:52,823
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

235
00:21:53,565 --> 00:22:04,134
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

236
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:16,319
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

237
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:27,762
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

238
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:39,308
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

239
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

240
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:53,015
So that's Sagi,
the feudal lord of this land, huh?

241
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,425
He's far away,
but he might be quite cool.

242
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:57,688
Shh, be quiet!

243
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,126
What is it, Neji?

244
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:02,195
Something's strange.
What's with this blood thirst?

245
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,133
What? Bloodthirsty?
Could it be assassins?

246
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:09,339
They might be Shinobi.
Is everyone ready?!

247
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,270
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

248
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,909
I'll protect the feudal lord!

249
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:15,936
