1
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:16,847
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,444
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:26,284
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,555
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:33,761
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:40,136
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:45,510
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,105
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:52,483
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,486
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:59,854
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,323
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:08,196
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,937
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:14,269
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,141
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,406
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,948
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:27,383
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,869
- Sumptuous meal!
- Sumptuous meal!

21
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,070
I feel a little thrown off balance.

22
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:54,168
Let's regroup, everybody!

23
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,274
Go!

24
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,449
I'm itchy, Elder Brother.

25
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,558
Yeah, itchy...

26
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:08,450
Huh?!

27
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,900
My punches aren't having
any effect whatsoever.

28
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:28,806
<i>Naruto...</i>

29
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,706
This doesn't look good.

30
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,609
Again!

31
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:39,948
Huh?

32
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,768
I It itches, Elder Brother.

33
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,407
Yeah... feels like I'm getting a rash.

34
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,639
D Damn!

35
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,150
I'm not done yet!

36
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,315
Stop it, Naruto!

37
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,191
It's futile...

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,525
- You won't swagger like that for long!
- You won't swagger like that for long!

39
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:31,832
This feels so good!

40
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,777
What's up with those guys anyway?

41
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,243
You're an idiot brat as always.

42
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,917
You have it hard, don't you?

43
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,885
Having to go on a mission
with that failure of a brat.

44
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,221
Don't you, Iruka?

45
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:51,554
Why, Mizuki?!

46
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,664
I'm asking you, please stop
this kind of foolishness!

47
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:59,368
Are you intending to betray
your comrades from the village again?

48
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,462
Comrades?

49
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,839
That's right!
Your comrades from the Leaf Village

50
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,741
with whom you shared
both pleasures and pain!

51
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,335
You can understand that,
can't you?

52
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,473
Comrades... huh?

53
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,887
As usual, you are nave,
aren't you... Iruka?

54
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:28,330
What I believe in is power!

55
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:33,362
Don't think you can shackle me with
such vague bonds like that of comrades!

56
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:34,602
Mizuki...

57
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,999
I will soon get my hands
on the ultimate power!

58
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,642
Lord Orochimaru's power!

59
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,449
Orochimaru?!

60
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,347
Then I'll teach you a lesson!

61
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,818
About how meaningless it is...

62
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,688
that thing you and the other Leaf guys
describe as camaraderie or whatever!

63
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,025
Mizuki...

64
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:00,531
You were an excellent Shinobi despite
having committed that crime, you...

65
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,190
Don't talk so knowingly!

66
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,900
<i>Damn! They're dodging all my attacks!</i>

67
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:18,912
Iruka, if you insist so much,
why don't you show me?

68
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,348
What degree of feeling
you really have for your comrades...

69
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,458
I wonder whether you'll really
be able to stop me?

70
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:28,952
Come!

71
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,223
Wait!

72
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,557
Naruto! Forget about these guys!
Pursue Mizuki!

73
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:36,932
Damn...!

74
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,068
I'm gonna settle this later
without fail!

75
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,438
Elder Brother, that guy went off.

76
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,814
They all went off, didn't they?

77
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,284
Elder Brother, could this be
a game of hide and go seek?

78
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,681
Hide-and -go -seek! Hide-and -go -seek!

79
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,289
So does that mean we're "It"?

80
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,089
Those jerks!

81
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,763
Making us "It" without even deciding
by scissors paper rock!

82
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,435
- Let's go, Raijin!
- Okay!

83
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,940
<i>A New Squad!</i>
<i>Two People and a Dog?!</i>

84
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,178
Over here... Iruka.

85
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:26,945
Hurry, Naruto!

86
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,782
Don't be fooled this time!

87
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:32,717
Shut up! It's 100 years too soon
to be arguing with me!

88
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,216
I'm telling you,

89
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,319
if you dilly dally the situation's gonna
get really troublesome again!

90
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,423
What?!

91
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,694
Found you!

92
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,867
Good job, huh, Elder Brother!

93
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,172
Yeah!

94
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,539
I don't have time to be
dealing with these guys!

95
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,941
Elder Brother, hide and go seek is fun,
but aren't you getting hungry?

96
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:02,776
You're really something,
aren't you, Raijin?

97
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,221
Leave some for your Elder Brother!

98
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,121
Of course, I will!

99
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,556
Hey, you idiot brothers!

100
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,255
- Huh?
- Huh?

101
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,501
This is no time to be eating!

102
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:20,271
I'm telling you, it's foolhardy
to be fighting these guys!

103
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,240
I already know that!

104
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,214
Mizuki! Where are you?!

105
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,142
What's the matter... Iruka?

106
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,013
Weren't you gonna stop me?

107
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,752
Stop this foolishness, Mizuki!

108
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,923
Come on out, Mizuki!

109
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,045
Always be aware of
an attack from behind...

110
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,208
For a Shinobi,
isn't that a basic rule?

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,125
Nicely done, Iruka.

112
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,963
Pretty good!

113
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,642
Always read behind the surface
of your enemy's bluffs...

114
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,707
For a Shinobi isn't that a basic rule?

115
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,717
That's my line!

116
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,280
What's that?

117
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,718
A Smoke Bomb?

118
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,425
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

119
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,092
- Come on over! Catch us if you can!
- Come on over! Catch us if you can!

120
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,390
Elder Brother, they're increasing!
They're increasing!

121
00:08:56,568 --> 00:09:00,004
Raijin, this must be
super hide and go seek, don't you think?

122
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,801
Yeah. That's right!

123
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:05,468
A decoy strategy, huh?
You thought it through.

124
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,740
We can buy some time this way.

125
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,311
All right, now's our chance...

126
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,073
- Super, super hide and go seek!
- Super, super hide and go seek!

127
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,799
There are,
there are two Old Lady Tsunades!

128
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,145
You're talking about
the idiotic strength, huh?

129
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,380
Haven't you come to
your senses yet?!

130
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,746
Shut up!

131
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,885
Why are you so obsessed with power!

132
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,090
Because that, if anything,
is everything!

133
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,697
Reconsider, Mizuki!
It isn't too late yet!

134
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,764
You are naive!

135
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,729
Don't you understand the situation?!

136
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,039
What's the matter?
Come on and attack, Iruka!

137
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,835
You're not my enemy!

138
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,675
You're my comrade from
the same village!

139
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,247
I told you, I'm tired of that kind of
song and dance!

140
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,908
And moreover...
you're my colleague!

141
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:26,450
You're a member of the same family
that inherited the same Will of Fire!

142
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,085
Will of Fire, huh?

143
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,486
Yes, that's right.

144
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,623
Therefore, please stop
the foolishness, Mizuki!

145
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,461
It irks me most when
you say things like that!

146
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,727
Mizuki!

147
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:42,264
Since we're old acquaintances
I was gonna kill you quickly.

148
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,903
But now I've decided against that.

149
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,470
You're gonna have some fun...

150
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,476
I'll give you a taste of how it feels

151
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,879
to be killed slowly by
your so called comrade!

152
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,618
Hey, Naruto... How long are you
planning to be like that?

153
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,091
It's just a matter of time till
those guys find you!

154
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,329
I found you!

155
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,268
What?! They found us!

156
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,638
All right! This is it!

157
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:21,836
Hide-and -go -seek!

158
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,105
Hide-and -go -seek!

159
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,079
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

160
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,646
Elder Brother,
super hide and go seek again?

161
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,980
I'm getting bored with this.

162
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,788
Shadow Clone again?!

163
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,056
As always,
you have no new tricks, huh!

164
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,591
Just leave it to me!

165
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,401
All right! Go!

166
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,834
- Okay!
- Go!

167
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,795
Wh What?!

168
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,873
What kind of game is this?

169
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,044
Wow, they're going so fast.

170
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,943
I see... Not bad.

171
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:04,313
I I feel sick... Elder Brother.

172
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,687
I'm woozy...

173
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,550
Now! Catch them!

174
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:11,886
Huh?!

175
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,597
You jerks...

176
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,696
What do you think you're doing?

177
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,398
The preparation's done!

178
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,242
Here it goes!
You fatso Herculean brothers!

179
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,448
<i>Concentrate... I must concentrate...</i>

180
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,160
Stop putting on airs!

181
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,166
A guy like you,
who's weaker than me!

182
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,293
Yeah! That's right, isn't it?!

183
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,001
<i>You always excelled over</i>
<i>anything I did, didn't you... ?

184
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,835
<i>I was always being helped by you,</i>
<i>wasn't I?</i>

185
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,811
One year has passed already, hasn't it?

186
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,749
It's not so easy to laugh,
hiding your sadness.

187
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,857
Your teacher told me that
you are the center of the laughter.

188
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,353
I'm not sad at all!

189
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,492
It's an honor for Shinobi
to die during their missions!

190
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,765
My dad and mom...

191
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:29,432
are heroes who protected this village
from the Demon Fox!

192
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,741
And I am the child of those heroes.

193
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:35,039
That's why I'm not sad
even though I'm alone...

194
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,808
These tears are from the happiness...

195
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,278
Enough already.

196
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:48,384
I'm always aware that
you are feeling Ionely.

197
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,686
But you are not alone.

198
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,728
All of Leaf's Shinobi
have the "Will of Fire."

199
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:01,797
"Will of Fire?"

200
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,606
It means the will to protect the Leaf.

201
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,242
As long as you have
the Will of Fire,

202
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:13,341
you and people in this village
are all family.

203
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,720
Iruka, I wonder if you have that.

204
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:22,752
Yeah.

205
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:30,460
Huh?

206
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,335
Who's that over there?

207
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:46,213
Mizuki...

208
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,710
What are you doing there?

209
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:53,790
Well, I heard that Iruka
was depressed these days...

210
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,692
I was worried and came to look for him.

211
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,224
Everybody's... worried about you, Iruka.

212
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,866
Everybody's waiting over there.
Come on and play with us!

213
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,133
It's all right... Go on.

214
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:26,884
The Mizuki that I idolized was kind...

215
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,620
And he was a guy who was more
thoughtful of his friends than anyone else.

216
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:32,254
Yet...

217
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:36,526
Please remember! Mizuki!

218
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
You really are...

219
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,270
an idiot, aren't you?!

220
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,945
L Let go...

221
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,178
Here it goes...

222
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,712
S Stop please!

223
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,083
I I feel sick...

224
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,158
- Huh?
- Eh?

225
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,589
What?

226
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,967
Elder Brother, don't tell me that you...

227
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,006
Sorry, Raijin... I squashed...

228
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:18,701
our lunch!

229
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,073
What?!

230
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,010
Stay still, guys!

231
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,717
Now take this...!

232
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,759
- Give us back our lunch!
- Give us back our lunch!

233
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:36,823
What?!

234
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,731
H-He's done it, huh...

235
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:59,048
It doesn't look like you understand me,
so let me explain.

236
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:03,445
The real reason I was kind to you...

237
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,780
Because it made me happy
more than anything

238
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,985
to see you in your misery!

239
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,133
Hey, Iruka!

240
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,029
We're gonna go play soccer right now.

241
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,969
Come join us, Iruka!

242
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,366
Sure! Okay!

243
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,100
I wonder if Iruka's okay

244
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,670
after all those things
that happened to him...

245
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,113
That's why we need to
try to cheer him up!

246
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,046
<i>Why...only him...</i>

247
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,217
<i>Everybody makes a fuss about him</i>

248
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,387
<i>just because of his parents</i>
<i>getting killed by Nine Tail...</i>

249
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:48,962
Serves you right...

250
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,466
<i>Even Lord Hokage?!</i>

251
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:02,146
<i>Why...why is it?!</i>

252
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:06,943
Who is it over there?

253
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:11,718
<i>All right...</i>

254
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,820
<i>I'm gonna try to gain the favor</i>
<i>of Lord Hokage too...</i>

255
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,160
What are you doing over there?

256
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:22,095
<i>Well, I heard that Iruka has been</i>
<i>depressed recently so...</i>

257
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,991
You're lying!

258
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,128
Treating a g uy who's weaker
than oneself with disdain

259
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,231
is the most pleasurable
feeling of all, Iruka.

260
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,500
You weren't that way in the past!

261
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,946
That's why I've been telling you...
you're nave!

262
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:41,179
That kind of naivet leads to fatal mistakes
on the battleground.

263
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:46,150
On the battleground, it's all about
how many enemies you can kill!

264
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,856
If you throw a Kunai blindly
in a bamboo grove,

265
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,523
all that will happen is that it'll bounce off
and its path will be errant.

266
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,665
If you're gonna take aim...
make it straight!

267
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,433
Don't think I'm gonna get fooled twice
with the same bait!

268
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,975
<i>Damn... I'm at a disadvantage if</i>
<i>we fight in a place like this!</i>

269
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:19,783
<i>Mizuki...</i>

270
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,886
<i>You...</i>

271
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:27,856
Mizuki!

272
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,229
I told you, it's useless...

273
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:39,676
If the path is going to be errant,

274
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:42,838
then one just needs to calculate
the path of the Kunai when throwing it!

275
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,411
So you've finally gotten serious, huh?

276
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,053
Follow me!

277
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,291
Where is this?

278
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,529
Looks like you're finally conscious.

279
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:06,904
You jerk...

280
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,436
You ruined our meal...

281
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,538
Don't even think
we're gonna let you leave here alive!

282
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,007
I'm going for his stomach!

283
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,514
I'm going for his head!

284
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,413
- One, two...
- One, two...

285
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,248
- Three!
- Three!

286
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:29,091
Huh?

287
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:30,284
Huh?!

288
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,002
Wh What is going on?

289
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,811
Gimme a break,
what are you doing?!

290
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,648
Wh Who's that?

291
00:20:57,088 --> 00:21:00,649
It's too much of a drag
to tell you my name, however...!

292
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,791
The most powerful support squad
assigned to this mission!

293
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,525
The most powerful trio from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

294
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,065
We're Ino Shika Cho!

295
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:32,352
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

296
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,824
<i>And you become speechless</i>

297
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:41,824
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

298
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:45,062
<i>So you don't answer</i>

299
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,766
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

300
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,643
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

301
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,147
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

302
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:07,352
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

303
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:16,959
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

304
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:26,136
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

305
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:37,949
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

306
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,164
What's with these guys?!
They have super ridiculous strength!

307
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:55,466
To think they can resist

308
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,838
Shadow Possession Jutsu
to this extent on sheer power!

309
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,605
If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now,
we'll be in a hairy spot!

310
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,238
Our only choice is to
settle this right away.

311
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,009
Are you guys ready?

312
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:05,740
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

313
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,578
Then let's go!
This is our trump card!

314
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:14,420
