00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,733
Naruto-kun

00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,117

Everyone of you will leave with
a score of ten points.

53
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,649
This is a deductive test.

54
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,450
If mistaken a question
a point will be removed you.

55
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:28,707
If mistaken three questions
the score will come down to seven.

56
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:32,364
If mistake ten questions I take zero points.

57
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,168
Rule number two:

58
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:39,095
The promoted ones or bocciati will come decided in function
of the final score of every square.

59
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:48,789
Waited for a moment!
How it would be the score total of square?

60
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,079
Hush!!

61
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,756
Reason is one for all.
Been zitti and listened.

62
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,035
One reason for all?

63
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,888
If you have understood, we continue with the rules.

64
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:04,774
If an examining one will be strange to copy or to make to you
something of similar during the test

65
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:10,893
 you will lose two points for
ciascuna of these actions.

66
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:16,063
In little words, there will be who
it will have to abandon knows it it

67
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:21,801
 until that its test
it will not come characterized.

68
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,902
I have understood!
It has created other situation in order to embezzle points.

69
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:33,881
You know that who will copy dishonourably
it will make one ugly end.

70
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,964
You will be constantly under control.

71
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:44,867
You are all intenzionati to become of the Chunin.
If you are of the ninja, you behave yourselves from worthy ninja.

72
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,109
I must tranquilizzarmi!
! !

73
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,424
To Naruto part, I
and Sasuke-kun we can make it us.

74
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:56,651
Even if Naruto had to take
zero we will compensate it.

75
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:01,531
Moreover, if someone had
to take zero points

76
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,484
 he will be bocciato with to its square.

77
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:07,262
COSAAA!

78
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:11,789
There are two persons whom they want to kill to me.

79
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,464
Naruto-kun

80
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,492
The last problem will be given to you

81
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:19,613
 after 45 minuteren from the beginning of the test.

82
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,077
You have an hour for the examination.

83
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,874
BEGUN!!

84
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:39,296
We are truly in the troubles

85
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:43,591
Naruto I pray to you, avoids to take one zero!

86
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:47,253
I see badly

87
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:52,020
 I hope that Naruto not
it has fallen in the panic.

88
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,024
To figure itself!

89
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:01,224
They are passed in many situations like this.

90
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:05,056
In these cases, I only must rilassarmi,
and to concentrate to me on the questions

91
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:09,678
 and to resolve those most feasible ones.

92
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:13,915
We see the first problem is
 a criptato text?

93
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,695
Following

94
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:19,396
Vediamo

95
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,036
 the second question is

96
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:24,577
The B line

97
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:32,099
 of the diagram it represents the maximum distance
percorribile from one shuriken launch from a ninja
situated on a high tree 7 meters.

98
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:38,809
To assume the characteristics of the ninja
considering the throw of the shuriken

99
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:44,783
 and it calculates the maximum throw from earth.
To give of the explanation.

100
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:51,192
But this is a question that it demands
the elaboration of one uncertain condition

101
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,747
 and the analysis of the energies.

102
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:57,035
Naruto pu   not to succeed to resolve it!

103
00:07:57,035 --> 00:08:03,236
Sure the greater part
of the persons it will not know to resolve it.

104
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:07,418
Ok, we pass to the following question.

105
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:15,248
The other questions are equally difficult!

106
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:29,743
I have understood!
These questions are impossible

107
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:35,872
That disaster!

108
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:41,105
They are truly, but truly in the troubles.

109
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:53,222
If they came promoted approximately 10 squares on 51

110
00:08:53,222 --> 00:09:00,191
 it would be made of all in order conserving the points.
E' a system that it pushes to you to copy.

111
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:05,428
I hope that Sasuke-kun and Naruto
they are not put to copy.

112
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:09,729
It will go well.
Neanche Naruto is cos   stupid.

113
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,947
I trust myself he.

114
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:19,095
Calm one. With calm. With calm, and

115
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:23,543
I must copy without makes to discover me!

116
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:28,843
Not! NOT! I cannot!

117
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,341
I cannot make one rischiosa what cos  ?!

118
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:35,365
They seem to be most careful

119
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:40,213
 it is like if they knew that we will copy sure.

120
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:44,965
Probable E' that takes
famous on those notebooks.

121
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:47,848
Someone must have been
been strange to copy.

122
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:51,654
Uncovered being to copy
it involves to lose two points.

123
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:55,044
To lose two points, eh?

124
00:09:55,315 --> 00:10:00,310
Normally, it is come expelled if they are strange to you to copy.

125
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:12,979
You know that who will copy dishonourably
it will make one ugly end.

126
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:17,954
If you are of the ninja, then you behave yourselves
like a good ones ninja.

127
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,867
 now I have been understood!

128
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,842
This is not only a test for
to estimate our acquaintances.

129
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:26,428
In truth it is

130
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,545
 it is a test in order to estimate
ability to collect information

131
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:34,104
 using the techniques
espionage officials.

132
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,562
The ninja they must know to anticipate the adversary.

133
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:44,329
Therefore the examiner means to spur to us to copy

134
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:49,228
 as only a worthy one ninja would make.

135
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:52,842
Single E' cos   that the removal
of the points it has sense.

136
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:59,387
One is loss of single two points
for every intercepted attempt.

137
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:06,256
It comes put to the test the ability to collect
information eluding the control of the assistants
and of the person from which copy

138
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:11,088
 and to obtain cos   the correct answer.

139
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,279
You must notice some, Naruto!

140
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,293
The examination if you do not make it!

141
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:27,280
Merda

142
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,930
If this examination

143
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,190
 servants to determine the ability
to obtain information

144
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,071
 she must it are to us someone in the class

145
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:42,413
 that she knows the answers!

146
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:53,469
It seems that Gaara has begun
Account on you Karasu.

147
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,940
Evvai!
Bravo Akamaru!

148
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,516
Now the question number four.

149
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,829
To judge from the rhythm, the order
of writing and from the number of blows

150
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,323
Well, I have understood!

151
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,405
Well, dimmi all.

152
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:56,184
Eight.

153
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:09,464
Lee, if you have seen it makes me
sign with the coprifronte.

154
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,443
The time st flying!!

155
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,430
Maledizione, does not remain to me that to copy!

156
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,398
For , if they discover to me, I would put
in the troubles Sakura-chan and Sasuke.

157
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,692
For   if I take zero

158
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,774
 Sakura-chan and Sasuke will come
bocciati however.

159
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,128
Naruto-kun

160
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,477
I make to see my task you.

161
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,883
What is saying?
Why it would make this for me?

162
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:10,244
 it is even a trabocchetto!?

163
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:15,191
For  Hinata it is not the type of person
that it would make one what of the sort.

164
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,590
For 

165
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,976
perhaps glielo Kiba has said
it makes me to fall in trap.

166
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,345
Hinata, you must dirmi one what.

167
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:28,236
Why you make to see your task me?

168
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:34,555
Why....

169
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,571
 I

170
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:49,365
 I do not want that you come endured bocciato.

171
00:14:53,257 --> 00:15:00,774
As you know we nine we are the only esordienti,
and more ahead there will be other difficulties.

172
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:07,966
Then they are cos   the things!
I have doubted of you without reason.

173
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:17,197
However it is, is one great opportunity.
They are content that Hinata is

186
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:43,279

Soon, it watches.

00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:09,362
Hinata, you have not understood?

189
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:15,549
A large one ninja like me
it does not have need to copy.

190
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:20,598
Naruto-kun but

191
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,825
Moreover

192
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:30,965
 helping me to copy you would put
in danger same you.

193
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:33,924
Naruto-kun

194
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,888

00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:47,711
Pu   not to contrast the technique of Ino.
