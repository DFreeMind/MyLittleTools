1
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:16,867
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,463
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:26,304
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:29,575
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:33,781
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:40,155
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:45,530
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:49,124
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,503
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,506
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:59,874
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,343
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:08,216
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,957
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,289
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,160
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,426
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,968
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:27,403
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:47,388
<i>Sakura's Determination</i>

21
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,724
Where's Sasuke!
Where did you put him?!

22
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:54,357
Heh! You're Naruto, right?

23
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,728
You wouldn't believe anything
I said anyway, would you...?

24
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,504
That's right! I won't believe
that Sasuke's dead!

25
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,009
Naruto...

26
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,373
That's right. Sasuke is alive.

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,518
I'll bring Sasuke back!

28
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:16,777
I made that promise!

29
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,086
Naruto...

30
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,155
In that case, take me down!

31
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,295
If I were the wimp I was in the past,

32
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,855
I would probably have
told you the truth.

33
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,058
Arashi!

34
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:33,000
No! The old Arashi is dead!

35
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:36,665
The person you see here
is just a block of flesh

36
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:39,939
kept alive by
Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!

37
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:55,215
Sakura, please look after Sasame!

38
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:57,519
Stop it, Naruto! Don't fight with Arashi!

39
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:58,357
No!

40
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:03,726
This guy isn't the same gentle Arashi
you once knew, Sasame!

41
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,428
Jigumo! Go!

42
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,836
No!

43
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:17,038
Sasame! I'm sorry!

44
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,283
Over here!

45
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,059
Naruto!

46
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,859
Don't, Sakura!

47
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:42,967
Kamikiri...!

48
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,004
Finish him!

49
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,444
Naruto!

50
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:09,530
You're... next...!

51
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:13,805
Sakura!

52
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,914
That was close...

53
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,891
I almost let my guard down.

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,225
Just when you had a chance
to launch a sneak attack.

55
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,697
You blew it, didn't you, Naruto?

56
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:42,756
Naruto!

57
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:46,169
All because of that ball and chain...!

58
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,632
Ball and chain?!

59
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,536
Naruto... I'm sorry!

60
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,079
That's not true at all!

61
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,318
This kind of injury...

62
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,053
is nothing... at all!

63
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,181
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

64
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,424
If there's three on your side,

65
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,223
I'll go with five on mine!

66
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:27,972
Kamikiri!

67
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:44,918
Naruto!

68
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,301
Are you all right?!

69
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:57,775
You're badly hurt...

70
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,911
Sakura... This injury is nothing!

71
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:07,107
"Sakura... This injury is nothing!"

72
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,892
Stop it! If you say more than that...!

73
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:20,725
I won't say more! I'll bring this to an end.

74
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,794
Kamikiri! Jigumo!

75
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,239
Give me your Chakra...

76
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:39,875
Boar, Dog, Rat,
Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,

77
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:46,379
Dog, Monkey, Dragon,
Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon...

78
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:50,455
Why does Arashi know that technique?

79
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:55,861
It's a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs
of the Fuma clan could use...

80
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,329
What was that?!

81
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,003
Fuma Ninja Art:

82
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,168
Spell of the Mandala!

83
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,567
This ain't good!

84
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,283
Naruto!

85
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,148
What the heck is this?!

86
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,216
This is the end!

87
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:25,620
What?!

88
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:29,798
Naruto!

89
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:34,303
The Chakra cage gradually shrinks...

90
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,843
And the human enclosed therein
is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.

91
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,903
You can't break it.

92
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:47,945
As long as I myself do not
dissolve the Jutsu.

93
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:53,849
Naruto!

94
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:08,532
<i>I'm incapable of doing anything...</i>

95
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:12,742
<i>There's nothing I'm capable of doing...</i>

96
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,644
<i>The person I am now isn't...</i>

97
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>capable of doing anything!</i>

98
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,285
Arashi!

99
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,535
Sasame...

100
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:42,833
You!

101
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,902
Sasame!

102
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,813
Please... come to your senses...

103
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,017
Become the old Arashi again!

104
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,843
I told you, already!

105
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:59,015
The old Arashi is dead.

106
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:16,666
Arashi...

107
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,707
I'm sorry, Sasame...

108
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:24,372
I wanted power...

109
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,416
I wanted the Fuma Clan to find
a place in the sun once again...

110
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:33,754
Yes! I understand that!
I understand that!

111
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,520
But, enough now...
Let's go home.

112
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,066
Let's go back to the village.

113
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,332
But, I'm just a mere monster now...

114
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,503
That's not true!

115
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,740
This is agony...

116
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,032
Sassme...

117
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,608
Please... kill me...

118
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,175
Please... kill...

119
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:07,556
How dare you try to kill me!

120
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:09,658
Arashi!

121
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:13,496
You'II... die!

122
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,582
Sakura!

123
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,611
Sakura?!

124
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:38,449
You wanna be... the first to die?

125
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,027
Sasame taught me that...

126
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,285
dying isn't anything to be scared of!

127
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:46,929
I see...

128
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:54,836
But what's scary is to live one's life
without having been able to do anything...

129
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,274
I'm not afraid to die in the service
of someone who is important to me!

130
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:00,808
Don't!

131
00:11:03,348 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm telling you...

132
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,947
Whatever happens, you mustn't die...
No matter what! Sakura!

133
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:10,749
Naruto!

134
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:12,880
Give it up!

135
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,589
What is it you think you're capable
of doing the way you are now?!

136
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,268
That's so useless!

137
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,207
Vanish from this world
get crushed into nothing...!

138
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,441
Sasame!

139
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,037
Stop that, Arashi!

140
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,613
Sasame... you!

141
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:53,998
Naruto!

142
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:55,698
Hey! Let go!

143
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,165
No!

144
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,996
Arashi?!

145
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:35,463
I'm sorry, Sasame...

146
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,867
I caused you so much hardship...

147
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,672
No, you haven't!

148
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,912
The person who experienced
the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!

149
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,348
Is there anything I can do for you?

150
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,612
What should I do for you?!

151
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:54,789
You've already helped me
more than enough...

152
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,794
See... Thanks to you, Sasame,

153
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,955
I was able to return to being
the person I was in the past...

154
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,438
Naruto!

155
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,233
Sakura...

156
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,272
Even if it's to be of service
to someone...

157
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,145
There's no life that
should be lost for that!

158
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:22,551
Yeah!

159
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:27,054
Run! Sakura!

160
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,561
Pervy Sage!

161
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,100
Sorry to be late!

162
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,134
I was faced with a number of obstacles
on my end too!

163
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,505
Gimme a break...

164
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,134
Now then...
Climb on, climb on!

165
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,246
Hurry! Let's get back above ground!

166
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,552
Oops!

167
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,022
Sasame!

168
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:05,227
She's fine... She just fainted.

169
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:09,355
Naruto!

170
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:15,902
Orochimaru assigned us a mission...

171
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,566
To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back

172
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,975
to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves under any circumstances!

173
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,505
Then, Sasuke is...?!

174
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,346
Yeah... He's alive!

175
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:29,585
Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke

176
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:34,148
because he is his vital vessel which
he will possess in three years!

177
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:39,263
Arashi...

178
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:42,798
Arashi... This place is gonna collapse!

179
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:43,959
Hurry up and come over here!

180
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:55,141
I'm already just a puppet...

181
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,579
I cannot live my life anywhere
except here.

182
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,643
Arashi...

183
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:04,983
All right!

184
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,657
No! Arashi!

185
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:13,286
Sasame...

186
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,260
Thank you.

187
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,619
Including Arashi,
we've paid an extraordinary price but...

188
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:42,419
The Fuma Clan has been
able to cut itself free

189
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,324
from Orochimaru's spell...

190
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,330
You can start again anew.

191
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,559
I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!

192
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:56,036
With this life...
that Arashi protected.

193
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,603
Yeah!

194
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,908
I am truly indebted to you.

195
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:07,808
Sasame...

196
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,779
Hanzaki, I'm leaving these two
in your hands!

197
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:16,225
Yes, sir!
Please take care along the road!

198
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,594
I will.

199
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,197
- Thank you!
- We thank you!

200
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,098
- Take care!
- See you again!

201
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,465
Hey! Hang in there!

202
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,741
Well, we weren't able
to find Sasuke,

203
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,302
but at least we now know
that he's alive somewhere...

204
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,413
We'll have to settle for the fact
that we were able to ascertain

205
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:42,942
the new information that we still have
a grace period of three years

206
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:45,990
before he becomes a vessel
to be possessed by Orochimaru.

207
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,087
Yes...

208
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,358
<i>Sasame knew what she needed</i>
<i>to do for her clan...</i>

209
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:56,999
<i>But this time again all I did was cry.</i>

210
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,536
<i>All I did was depend on Naruto...</i>

211
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:01,602
Sakura!

212
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,401
You gave your best effort too!

213
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:10,175
No, I was just a ball and chain
to everyone...

214
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,444
I wasn't capable of doing
anything alone...

215
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:14,982
That's not true!

216
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:21,422
Seeing you give your best effort
like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.

217
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:27,554
If you hadn't been there, Sakura,
I'd have been crushed just like that.

218
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,793
It's thanks to you, Sakura!

219
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:33,164
Naruto...

220
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,440
Wow, you've grown into someone
who can say that sort of thing!

221
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:44,812
Oww! I'm an injured man!
Treat me with a little more care!

222
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,643
Oh yeah, that's right!

223
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:54,551
<i>All I was thinking about at that time</i>
<i>was protecting someone I cared about...</i>

224
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:03,399
<i>What I'm capable of</i>
<i>doing right now...</i>

225
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,472
I was thinking...

226
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:12,541
What?

227
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:17,111
There are many variables such
as mission level,

228
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:20,116
or platoon's member structure...

229
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,710
But no matter how small
a platoon might be,

230
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:26,279
I think it's important to assign
one Medical Ninja to it...

231
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,485
I know that already...

232
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,390
I wrote exactly the same thing
in a report long ago

233
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:34,863
regarding the survival rate and mission
achievement rate of small platoons.

234
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,861
But it's not that easy to
nurture Medical Ninja.

235
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,036
They require a different set of skills
than that of fighting types Ninja...

236
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,611
The minute perfection
of Chakra control,

237
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,738
the ability to assimilate a huge volume
of specialized knowledge,

238
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:55,081
the brains to apply that in a broad way...
patience...

239
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,612
And there is the most important thing

240
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:01,146
for Shinobi who are to develop
into a Medical Ninja...

241
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:06,788
Well, I'm busy right now, so...

242
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,435
The most important thing... huh?

243
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:17,070
Hidden Leaf Hospital
I'm all wrapped up in bandages again...

244
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:20,304
This way I can't even
hold chopsticks...

245
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:25,578
Sakura, when it's time for
my meal, feed me, okay?

246
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,344
I'll open up my mouth just like this and...

247
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,154
Huh? Sakura?

248
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:37,322
I'm sorry! I was just joking!

249
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,352
I'm sorry... Naruto...

250
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:40,723
Huh?

251
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,497
This is gonna mean that
I'll keep you waiting a little but...

252
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:51,636
Nex. T time, I definitely won't...

253
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:55,879
be a ball and chain to you!

254
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:02,982
Huh?

255
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,515
Enter!

256
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,262
I came here with a request!

257
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,030
What is it?

258
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,668
Please make me your apprentice!

259
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:44,618
<i>You're very desperate, aren't you?</i>

260
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,328
Sakura Haruno,

261
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:51,198
I heard from Kakashi that you have
a brilliant mind as well as will power!

262
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:56,038
All right.

263
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:00,734
But in exchange,
I'm not gonna be easy on you!

264
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:02,336
Yes, ma'am!

265
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,677
<i>This recent mission...</i>

266
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,718
<i>Iooks like it wasn't wasted</i>
<i>on her, after all.</i>

267
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:28,966
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

268
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,343
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

269
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:45,914
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

270
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

271
00:21:57,435 --> 00:22:02,429
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

272
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:11,739
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

273
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:23,452
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

274
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:33,894
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

275
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,648
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

276
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,918
He makes me so angry,
that Pervy Sage!

277
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,118
Didn't he say " I'll make you
my disciple and hone your skills"?!

278
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,161
When Sakura's already become
the Old Lady Tsunade's

279
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,662
and is working so hard!

280
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,595
And he just leaves me to
my own devices! Hey!

281
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,136
All because he was assigned
a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!

282
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:10,401
If things come to this,

283
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:13,375
I'm gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade
a piece of my mind!

284
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,171

from the Maximum Security Prison"
