1
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:14,308
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:34,061
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:39,933
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,033
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,638
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:58,320
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:05,294
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:17,933
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:24,343
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:29,545
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:48,160
<i>A Past to Be Erased</i>

12
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,532
That mark...

13
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,369
I saw the same one on the guys
that attacked this village!

14
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:54,875
That's a lie!

15
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:57,980
It's not a lie! This mark...

16
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,213
Same from that night...

17
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,530
<i>N No! Spare me!</i>

18
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:22,999
<i>Stop!</i>

19
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,587
This is the same mark from
that time.

20
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:46,725
No way!

21
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:50,455
But this wasn't in
the medical team's report.

22
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,126
<i>Byakugan!</i>

23
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:56,737
It seems this is a particular mark
that only emerges

24
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,240
when he sweats...

25
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,135
You guys get out!

26
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,809
Why?

27
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,040
I'm going to take care of him.

28
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,181
Say what?! I won't let you do that!

29
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,777
Why do you protect him?
Is the Leaf Village also in cahoots?

30
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,314
No, that's not it!

31
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:17,090
He doesn't remember
a thing from the past...

32
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,029
He has no memory.

33
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:22,092
No memory?

34
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:26,533
It's memory loss.
We came in search of his memory.

35
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:31,064
Then you should know now.
He's a dirty bandit!

36
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,139
Whether or not he has a memory
makes no difference to me!

37
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:35,408
Calm down!

38
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,641
It would only be in vain
to kill someone

39
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,579
who has no memory of
committing a crime.

40
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:40,612
Shut up!

41
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,851
If you really want to have
your revenge,

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,083
do so as much as you like
after getting his memory back...

43
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,088
I won't stop you at that time.

44
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,289
I won't let you do that even if
he gets his memory back!

45
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,862
It's as Neji says.

46
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,328
We'll also find out the identity
of the guys who attacked

47
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:02,633
if his memory returns
and we get him to talk.

48
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:06,331
We might be able to save the village
if we can use him to cut a deal...

49
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:10,779
We have to keep him alive now.
We won't run away or hide!

50
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,911
Keep quiet... He won't let Menma live
unless we tell him this.

51
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:22,789
I'm going to sew up the wound.
Hold his arms and legs.

52
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,099
That girl is...

53
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,468
I just can't believe it.
He's the embodiment of good nature...

54
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,398
To think he'd be a comrade
of the bandits.

55
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,672
I wonder if he became a good guy
after losing his memory.

56
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:16,374
He just has the same mark as those guys
due to some sort of circumstance.

57
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,337
Even if he lost his memory,

58
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:21,441
he wouldn't become this good natured
of a guy if he was a bad person.

59
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:25,286
Either way, we'll know everything
if he get his memory back.

60
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,854
I was... a comrade of the bandits,
wasn't I?

61
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,593
You heard us talking earlier?

62
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:41,035
Don't worry about it.
We don't know any of the details. Okay?

63
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,573
Heal that wound for now...

64
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,618
I'm going to have
a look around the area.

65
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,177
You understand, right?

66
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:01,256
Your friends and that guy will die
if you try anything funny.

67
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,255
Do as you like when that happens.

68
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,358
It's done...

69
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:21,299
Fuki...

70
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,300
You heard, didn't you?

71
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,445
I can't stand it, after all!

72
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,343
Let's get him. Let's avenge everyone!

73
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:32,340
Stop!

74
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,181
It's still not certain that
Menma's one of their comrades!

75
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,810
You're just as much to blame
if you protect him!

76
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,048
- Right!
- Right!

77
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,179
What's the ruckus?!

78
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:42,957
Naruto?

79
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:43,918
Tenten...!

80
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,285
Why did you let him out of the hut?!

81
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,456
Sorry. I dozed off...

82
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,765
I got careless thinking
he couldn't move...

83
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:56,099
Guys, stop! He has no memory!

84
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:59,831
So he doesn't even know if
he's one of their comrades or not...!

85
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:01,944
We warned you before!

86
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,138
You guys are just as much to blame
if you protect him any further!

87
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:07,310
Get them!

88
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:08,646
Stop it!

89
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,248
We should get away for now!

90
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,389
I'm... fine...

91
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:15,349
What?

92
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:20,563
Of course, everyone's angry.
I... should be punished.

93
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,897
You'll be killed!

94
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:22,896
That's fine!

95
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,732
What're you saying, Menma?!

96
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:30,397
Byakugan!

97
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:38,781
It's them!

98
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,743
The bridge! Raise the bridge!

99
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,575
Right!

100
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:42,685
Got it!

101
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,502
Be careful of the Leaf Ninja and
secure an entrance route!

102
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:10,408
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

103
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,678
Now's our chance.
Everyone hide!

104
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:15,513
You, too!

105
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:18,450
We can take care of this ourselves!

106
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:21,681
Come on, Fuki!

107
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:33,903
They've come from two spots!

108
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:36,432
Where'd they go?!

109
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,097
They vanished.

110
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,136
Be quiet!

111
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:47,845
The wind...

112
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:50,180
<i>I get it.</i>

113
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,552
<i>They've trapped us</i>
<i>in a Genjutsu</i>

114
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:55,022
<i>with a different tone mixed in</i>
<i>with the sound of the wind!</i>

115
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,823
Be careful!
We're now inside their Jutsu!

116
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,789
You noticed too late!

117
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,537
M My body...

118
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:09,567
It's heavy...

119
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,539
This is bad... Is it Paralysis?!

120
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:15,103
<i>Canceling Sound!</i>

121
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,476
The Paralysis is released.

122
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,750
You backstabber!

123
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:24,080
Here they come!

124
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,083
I'll leave those guys to you!

125
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:28,656
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

126
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,158
It's futile!

127
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,960
Heh, what's the matter?
Finished already?!

128
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't even have a scratch on me...

129
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,764
This is what I was after!

130
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:45,098
Wha?!

131
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,406
What's happening?
I'm getting an amazing power.

132
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:52,743
Here I go!

133
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:54,347
Rotation!

134
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,213
Now, prepare yourself!

135
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:01,824
You won't get away!

136
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:27,073
Here...

137
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,411
This is precious to you, right?

138
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,092
Behind you!

139
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,758
You jerk!

140
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:48,168
Your voice... It's back!

141
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,538
Th Thank you...

142
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,836
Now, let's go back to the others.

143
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,867
Right.

144
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,772
Menma! You okay?

145
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:01,040
Yeah...

146
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,479
We took care of most of them!

147
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,749
What about their leader?
What about Shiin?!

148
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,650
I chased after him,
but he got away...

149
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,090
This is bad...

150
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:15,896
Now that Shiin knows the villagers
won't abandon their homes and get out,

151
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,455
he'll use his last resort.

152
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:24,071
There is a dam built upriver to secure
water resources during a drought.

153
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,106
There is enough water for the village
to last a year, even if it doesn't rain.

154
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,505
The dam has been rigged to blow up

155
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:35,642
and to sw eep away
the entire village with a flood.

156
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:40,084
All they care about
is the mine.

157
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,191
We can't stop something like a flood

158
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,352
unless we move mountains
or something!

159
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:46,526
Mountains...

160
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,095
That's it.
We should move mountains!

161
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,798
Naruto! Take me to the mine.

162
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:54,862
Wha?

163
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:58,098
There should be a bunch of
Letter Bombs in the mine!

164
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,003
Letter Bombs?!
What're you going to do with those?!

165
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,707
I'm going to blow up
the mine itself.

166
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:07,116
The crumbled dirt and sand will
fill up the valley

167
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:09,080
and the flood can be stopped.

168
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:18,286
Damn it! He's started!
Let's hurry, Menma!

169
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:23,361
Naruto... There's something
I have to tell you.

170
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:25,231
Make it later!

171
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,769
I haven't lost my memory.

172
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:32,436
Yeah... But stopping
the flood comes first!

173
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,403
No, I'd like you to listen now.

174
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:40,875
I lost my parents when I was little
and was raised in Shiin's clan.

175
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:45,914
They were a small Shinobi clan even
in the Land of Rice Paddies.

176
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:50,417
But they still had ambitious plans...

177
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:54,219
However, a Shinobi village was created
in the Land of Rice Paddies

178
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:55,389
about a year ago.

179
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:57,932
It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.

180
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,391
<i>The Village Hidden in the Sound!</i>

181
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:04,000
Clan members confident in their skill

182
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:06,735
drifted over to Hidden Sound Village
one after another.

183
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,946
Eventually jobs from
the feudal lord stopped coming.

184
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:16,313
Shiin the leader of the clan that
had lost its means of livelihood

185
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:19,321
set his eyes on the mine in this village...

186
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,286
The plan was to just threaten
and chase off the villagers.

187
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:30,129
But I encountered
unexpected resistance,

188
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,263
and I got scared and tried to escape...

189
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:38,963
<i>What're you hesitating for?</i>
<i>Hurry up and take care of him.</i>

190
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,741
<i>Father! Father!</i>

191
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,943
<i>Stop it!</i>

192
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:51,980
<i>You... You jerk!</i>

193
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:55,418
<i>Look out!</i>

194
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,969
I'm a member of a clan that
has committed crimes.

195
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,897
It would've been better if
I'd just died like that...

196
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:14,074
How easy things would've been
if I could've died then...

197
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:20,374
I got scared thinking about
the villagers who died...

198
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,275
I wanted to forget.

199
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:27,481
And so I cowardly escaped into
a Jutsu passed down through the clan

200
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,457
that erases memory.

201
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:33,059
However, the Jutsu didn't work
very well...

202
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:39,362
I only temporarily lost my memory
and it came back in a few hours.

203
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:47,000
Then you had your memory
the whole time?!

204
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:48,437
I'm sorry...

205
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,570
Knock it off!

206
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:55,713
Then why didn't you tell me about
that honestly from the start?!

207
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:56,979
If you had, it would've been...

208
00:15:57,353 --> 00:16:01,483
I didn't have the courage to make
the crimes of the clan public.

209
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,589
But I thought the clan must
not commit any further crimes.

210
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,963
So I pretended to lose
my memory.

211
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:16,701
And to prevent the clan from
adding to their crimes...

212
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,332
I wanted to bring some of you
Leaf Shinobi here

213
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,139
and have you help out.

214
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,804
I knew of Shiin's next plan.

215
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:30,083
There must not be any
more village casualties.

216
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:34,616
Stopping that is my duty
for having survived.

217
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:36,291
Duty?

218
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,553
I needed the help
of the Leaf Shinobi

219
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,259
before Shiin could
execute his next plan...

220
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:50,431
I wanted to round them all up
during the attack earlier.

221
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,275
But since things have come this far,
I'll stop the flood.

222
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,911
Thanks, Naruto...

223
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:05,283
I leave Shiin to you.
Find and stop him, no matter what.

224
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,053
You... This...?

225
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,786
This is goodbye.

226
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:13,528
Somebody has to blow up
the Letter Bombs inside...

227
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,254
If you do that, you'II...!

228
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,898
Thanks to you, my life has
taken on more meaning...

229
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,012
What's that sound?

230
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:34,879
There are intermittent explosions
occurring upriver...

231
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,546
The village will be engulfed in
a mudslide if the dam breaks!

232
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:39,451
No!

233
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:40,986
Neji...

234
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:57,361
It's coming!

235
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,210
Goodbye...

236
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:14,619
Naruto...

237
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:20,821
Menma!

238
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,300
Wh What happened...?

239
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:32,373
It seems the crumbled mountain
stopped the mudslide...

240
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,136
Then, that means the village is saved?

241
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:36,337
Yeah...

242
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,377
- Thank goodness!
- That's a relief...

243
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:56,059
H-How can that be?!

244
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,592
Menma!!

245
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,271
That jerk...!

246
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:11,580
He won't get away!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

247
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,042
Hold it!

248
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,144
Interfering with our plan!

249
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,224
You think such a Jutsu will work
on me... Huh?!

250
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:32,523
Die!

251
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,166
I'll stop you in Menma's place!

252
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,269
What?!

253
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,170
Rasengan!

254
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,251
He sacrificed his life to save
the village, huh?

255
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:02,559
No matter what his past was,
he was a good guy at heart...

256
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:04,154
Mister...

257
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:07,660
I wanted to say a word of apology.

258
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:12,271
Not being able to remember
anything until the end

259
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:15,139
might have been salvation for him...

260
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:32,655
It was a promise, right?
To eat this with you.

261
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,595
You don't need
to say anything to him?

262
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:39,363
He'll be fine if he has an appetite.
I know how he is.

263
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,398
He'll overcome it on his own
as time passes.

264
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:47,199
For a while he'll probably remember
each time he eats ramen...

265
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:48,844
That's fine.

266
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,878
People can get stronger
precisely because

267
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:53,545
they have feelings
that are never forgotten...

268
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,615
That's what's called growth.

269
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:06,218
Damn... This is good!

270
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:14,831
Menma...

271
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:23,909
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

272
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:30,248
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

273
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:40,058
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

274
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:44,657
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

275
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:49,602
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

276
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:54,473
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

277
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:59,446
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

278
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:03,679
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

279
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:08,155
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

280
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:15,562
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

281
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:19,465
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

282
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:24,734
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

283
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:28,868
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

284
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:33,745
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:38,443
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

286
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,584
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

287
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,459
The Village Hidden in the Sand
requested an auxiliary force?

288
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,694
Ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials

289
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,762
took one of Sand Village's Ninja
candidates as a hostage

290
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,771
and escaped towards
the Land of Fire.

291
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:02,034
Presently, Gaara and others
are chasing them.

292
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,011
That means an ambush, doesn't it?

293
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:05,476
I will leave the strategy up to you.

294
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:09,343
Take some Genin you can use
and leave within half an hour.

295
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:10,715
- That's all.
- Hold on please.

296
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:11,445
What is it?

297
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,946
Let me borrow Sakura.

298
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,685
Next time: "The Targeted Shukaku
