00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,931
I have decided

31
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,235
 for a change of image.

32
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,256
Only a change of image!

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,572
I prefer them long, but you know

34
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:53,586
 in this forest they are only of impiccio.

35
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,473
On purpose, than us fairies here?

00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,798

00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,977
All they have saved to us.

38
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:14,008
Sakura is hiding its
feelings an other time.

39
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,645
Now us task I.

40
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,532

Hey

46
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,711
And the ninja of the sound?

47
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:40,286
Sasuke has them defeats.

48
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:42,919
I understand

49
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:46,298
Why you have I churn alone?

50
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:48,580
Six one rag.

51
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,954
Sakura-saint it was in danger and how much man

52
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,020
 I had to help it.

53
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,775
Absurdity.

54
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:59,810
Lee would not have never lost
if they had not been in three.

55
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:03,008
Six just stupid one!

56
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:07,252
Task that you have reason.

57
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:10,435
The sopracciglione!

58
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,389
Naruto !

59
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,287
How it dares to maltrattare Lee?

60
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:18,723
Ahi

61
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:22,658
Goodness knows cos' it has happened while I slept.

62
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:27,273
Naruto is without hope.

63
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:32,189
E' the type that could not never become
the protagonist of one history.

64
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,507
Lee-saint.

65
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,182
Thanks.

66
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:43,564
Thanks to you I have found the spirit just.

67
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:46,968
I feel of being pochino a more fort.

68
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:52,600
Sakura-saint!

69
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:58,069
I have understood of having to me to engage more.

70
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,165
Sasuke-kun.

71
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:03,543
The Uchiha clan is indeed remarkable.

72
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,562
Six cos   powerful that alone

73
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:09,091
 you have defeated the ninja of the sound

74
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,302
 when I have been impotent.

75
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,795
What!

76
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,668
E' be defeated?

77
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:17,391
What means?

78
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:21,079
They were indeed cos   strong?

79
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,052
Sakura-saint.

80
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:26,641
The Loto of the village
of Konoha it blooms two times.

81
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,420
The next time that
we will meet ourselves  I will be  stronger.

82
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,850
You I promise.

83
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,112
Of agreement!

84
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,973
Hey, Sakura!

85
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,591
You come here!

86
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:45,783
I arrange you hats!

87
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,182
Thanks.

88
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,365
You would have give one to you washed!

89
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:59,625
Wide forehead that you have also embraced Sasuke.

90
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,547
It makes figurone who executes
the first attack, Ino-porcella.

91
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,497
Uchiha

92
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,603
 Sasuke.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,593
A formidable adversary.

94
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,750
You are well, Akamaru?

95
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,274
Akamaru, you are shaking

96
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:33,401
 already from average day.

97
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,163
Akamaru?

98
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,612
You cannot.blame it.

99
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:40,093
To see one of the sort what

100
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,995
Yahoo!

101
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,423
This s   that it is a examination
of survival!

102
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:47,581
Just Akamaru!

103
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:53,389
Fortune that the boys who are ended
in the trap they had the coil of the earth.

104
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,793
At this rate we will arrive
for first to the tower.

105
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:59,103
We are calm.

106
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,273
Dangerous E'.

107
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:05,511
Also the smallest bug
it is always careful to proteggersi.

108
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:08,887
We must be cautious not to meet to us
against other adversaries.

109
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:10,298
E' the surer way.

110
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,509
I know!

111
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,963
Perche you must always be cos   serious?
Insettone!

112
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,867
M but

113
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,728
Task that Shino has reason.

114
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:26,523
Of agreement. I have understood.

115
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:30,646
I hope that Naruto-kun is well.

116
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,995
Hey! Firm!

117
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:40,021
Cautious and without to attract
the attention of the enemy eh?

118
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,187
Then Hinata

119
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:45,060
 you succeed to see to approximately
a kilometer in that direction?

120
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,649
Sure. Endured.

121
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:50,040
Byakugan!

122
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,045
There is someone here....

123
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,235
It seems that

124
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,072
 ce they are six.

125
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:07,307
Okay! We go to control!

126
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,199
Eh?

127
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,060
Kiba! But that you are saying?

128
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,353
We do not have.

129
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:17,418
The esaminatrice has only said to carry
the coil of the sky and the earth.

130
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:20,802
But it has not specified
not to take any in excess.

131
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,841
If we take other coils

132
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,536
 more squares will come bocciate.

133
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,971
M ma

134
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,257
While we see who are.

135
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:34,216
If they are dangerous types we will not fight.

136
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:36,418
From i, we go!

137
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:40,224
Insopportabile Dannaz che!

138
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:50,032
That there is Akamaru?

139
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,552
What happens? It has been stopped of blow.

140
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:57,647
Akamaru is shaking.

141
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,159
Why?

142
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,167
Akamaru fiuta the chakra of the avverasario
and of it it perceives the force.

143
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,635
Never it has not been put to shake cos .

144
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:13,513
The boys who are fighting here
they are tutt' other that mediocre.

145
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:22,576
Mocciosi of the sand you are just stupid

146
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:24,980
 in order to come encounter to us.

147
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,815
That type....

148
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:40,292
That it will have in the zucca
in order to attack briga with those.

149
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,166
What is saying Akamaru?

150
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:49,571
It has an ugly prefeeling
for the spilungone.

151
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,059
They seem just dangerous.

152
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,562
Hey, boy!

153
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:00,298
You would have to deal your adversaries more kindly.

154
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,359
Morirai.

155
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,768
Enough with chiacchere.

156
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:09,004
We go endured to the kernel, straccione.

157
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,825
Who of they has the coil?

158
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,889
Hey, Gaara.

159
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,067
E' better to inform to us before

160
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,947
If they have our same coil
not there is need to fight.

161
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,381
Better to avoid useless crashs.

162
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,139
It does not interest to me.

163
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,195
Those that encounter

164
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:33,072
 they must die.

165
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:38,327
For this hatred to be with he.

166
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:43,291
We begin endured!

167
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,615
You die, mocciosi!

168
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,639
Ninpo! Jouro Senban!

169
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,450
Direzionabili nail!

170
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:05,663
Not there is way to escape to this technique.

171
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:11,993
Moreover my nail are address to you
from the chakra towards the target.

172
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,509
Too much easy.

173
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,203
All here?

174
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,337
N..non is possible....

175
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:31,567
It has not hit it neanche a nail!

176
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,808
Impossible.

177
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,690
One rain of nail, eh?

178
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,634
Then....

179
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,557
 I will show  you  one blood rain.

180
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:55,374
Che chakra immense.

181
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:57,235
In more

182
00:11:57,235 --> 00:12:01,865
 that sand has a pungente odore.

183
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:03,792
Odore?

184
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,778
A odore fort of blood.

185
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,049
A sand wall?

186
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,735
Exact.

187
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:16,582
The sand is one absolute protection.

188
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:21,326
Gaara controls the sand to the inside of the giara

189
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:26,373
 and the pressed one with a chakra immense
in order protect he and the surrounding area.

190
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:31,945
In more, it does not happen for simple will of Gaara,
but it happens automatically.

191
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,038
That is, against Gaara

192
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:36,971
 every attack is useless.

193
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,168
This is not possible!

194
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:43,004
You cannot defeat our Gaara.

195
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,432
You close the spout!

196
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,845
Dead E'!

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,951
Here what you obtain to put to you
in its road.

198
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:59,087
* Sabaku Kyuu.
(Sand Cage)

199
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:10,860
I do not succeed to move to me!

200
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,081
T you

201
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:26,899
I could limit to me to fill up to you
of sand the mouth

202
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,744
 but he would be too much cruel.

203
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:03,504
* Sabaku SouSou.
(Funeral of the desert)

204
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:17,612
It has not suffered.

205
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,166
Not there was need that suffered seen
the difference of force between me and he.

206
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:25,954
The blood of defeated the fray
with the sand that flows

207
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:30,178
 donating more power to me.

208
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:35,217
T we will give the coil to you!

209
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:39,219
I pray to you lasciaci to go!

210
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:47,182
Not!

211
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,119
Oh not!

212
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,462
Endured Scappiamo!

213
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,937
If they find to us, we are died!

214
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:07,292
That fortune, the coil of the "Sky ".

215
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,774
Well, we head towards the tower.

216
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,234
You are zitto.

217
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,912
Still they are not satisfied.

218
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:18,674
I haul!

219
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,013
It has to us uncovered?

220
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,259
We stop It, Gaara.

221
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,141
You have for case fear?

222
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,849
Codardo.

223
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,336
Gaara!

224
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,448
Perhaps for you not there will be problems

225
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,925
 but for we it is dangerous.

226
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,236
Us servants only this brace of coils!

227
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,384
Any other is....

228
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:45,308
They do not give orders to me, incapable.

229
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,740
They give a cut to us!

230
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,523
Some time listens
your greater brother!

231
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,239
I have not never considered you my siblings.

232
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,358
Intralciatemi, and....

233
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,142
 I will kill  to you.

234
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,927
G..Gaara, from you stop it.

235
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,905
Not to make the scontroso.

236
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,716
From at least I listen to your sister.

237
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,458
And '?

238
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,504
Gaara!

239
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:52,595
Of agreement.

240
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:11,455
Here why hatred the children.

241
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,725
I have understood what you meant Akamaru

242
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:24,460
Merda potevi to say it before!

243
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,826
Not there is nobody here.

244
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,522
We are first?

245
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:38,113
Not! Averto other presences.

246
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:41,005
Akamaru you are well?

247
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,013
E' from before that it does not stop to shake.

248
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:48,291
First Akamaru has said something?

249
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:55,000
Akamaru said that it saw the spilungone badly
in the sense that that one of the sand would have killed it.

250
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:58,344
Not there is still nobody.

251
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:01,044
They will make us to wait for all the day?

252
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,789
But how much will be along?

253
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,696
In any case

254
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,074
 the boy of the village of the sand

255
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:27,034
 I do not know who is, but

256
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:30,594
 it is indeed dangerous.

257
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:39,972
The situation is falling.

258
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,467
Moreover we cannot suspend the examination.

259
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,227
What wants to say?

260
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:46,262
Me excuses.

261
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:47,005
What is?

262
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,624
We are a lot occupied!

263
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:50,817
Me excuses

264
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,844
 but it must watch this!

265
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,135
A video?

266
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,535
Here now!

267
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:03,372
It gives a glance to the timetable.

268
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,731
But

269
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:19,584
E' a record an hour and 37 minuteren
from the beginning of the second test!

270
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,915
The three ninja of the village of the sand....

271
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:25,038
 they have exceeded the second test.

272
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,940
But as it is possible?

273
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,902
In solo 97 minuteren

274
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,824
Never it had not happened.

275
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,394
Decidedly unusual E'.

276
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:41,171
Their level exceeds that one of a genin.

277
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:45,767
Absurd E' that we have exceeded
the old record of four hours.

278
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,751
It is not all.

279
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,195
What you want to say?

280
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:55,275
From the entrance to the arena
to the tower there are approximately 10 Km.

281
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:59,371
Wild beasts, velenosi bugs, arduous territories.

282
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:03,475
They have crossed like if not
they had met null of  that.

283
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:06,695
Especially that one with brown hats....

284
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,346
Cos' has this boy?

285
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,287
You have not noticed it?

286
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:19,209
I understand. Incredible E'.

287
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:23,187
What is of incredible?

288
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:26,534
It observes its body.

289
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:36,911
I understand....

290
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,170
 neanche a scratch.

291
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,046
And neanche

292
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:43,658
 one spot of dirt on the dressed ones.

293
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,369
Neanch' I indeed

294
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,454
 no chunin

295
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:52,458
 it would be in a position to arriving
to the tower without a scratch.

296
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,437
Perhaps this fact derives
from some its ability

297
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:59,996
A lot promising seems a boy.

298
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:03,905
Even if it does not appeal to its look to me.

299
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,270
nee kikoe masu ka?
