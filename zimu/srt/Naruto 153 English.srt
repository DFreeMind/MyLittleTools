1
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,931
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:21,527
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:26,368
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:29,639
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,845
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:40,219
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:45,594
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,188
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,567
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,570
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,938
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,407
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:08,280
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,949
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,353
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:19,224
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,490
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:24,032
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,467
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,052
<i>A Lesson Learned!</i>
<i>The Iron Fist of Love</i>

21
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,466
Please don't die...
I'll get you out now.

22
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,947
Hey!

23
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,049
What are you doing there?

24
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,332
Curry of Life Shop

25
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,366
One, two...
One, two...

26
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,609
<i>Hope they're all right.</i>

27
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,118
<i>I'm sure they'll be able</i>
<i>to bring Karashi back.</i>

28
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,213
Definitely, Definitely.

29
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,916
One, two...

30
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:08,659
That's the Katabami Gold Mine...

31
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:12,037
Instead of just getting
Rokusuke and Karashi back,

32
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,271
let's finish the Kurosuki Family
once and for all!

33
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:17,808
Don't get carried away, Naruto.

34
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,379
So, what are we gonna do then?

35
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:23,846
I'm kind of worried about
what Guy Sensei told us.

36
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,111
The boss of the Kurosuki Family
may be

37
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,782
one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist.

38
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,619
Who knows what
they'll do to Rokusuke?

39
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah, but how seriously
can we take Guy Sensei's info?

40
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:40,224
What are you talking about?!
Guy Sensei is always right!

41
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,267
Calm down, Lee.
We should investigate first.

42
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:44,732
Yeah!

43
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:07,553
Sir Raiga, we were able
to capture Rokusuke,

44
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,689
one of the three that
slipped out of the village.

45
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,133
Well done.

46
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:26,738
It seems that they went to ask
for some help from a Ninja village.

47
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,746
Where did you go?!

48
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,683
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,414
Don't bother, rookie.

50
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:34,284
Yes sir!

51
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,895
Rokusuke, I thought we had
a good relationship

52
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:43,261
with everybody in the Gold Mine.

53
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,026
Well, that's...

54
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:53,236
Why is it? I'm so deeply sorry
to hear that you left the village.

55
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,708
I can't remember how things
were in the past,

56
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,303
when everything was going well.

57
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:01,139
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again!

58
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,978
Yeah, I have a good idea.

59
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,984
I'm going to arrange
for your funeral.

60
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:12,390
Please don't! Please let me go!

61
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:16,056
I won't do it again,
so please forgive me!

62
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:19,832
Why? Don't you like funerals?

63
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:23,162
No, I don't wanna die yet!

64
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,800
You know, I really like funerals...

65
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,774
Think about it.

66
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:33,410
When they are alive, humans speak ill
of each other,

67
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,882
they betray each other,
and they hate each other.

68
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,320
But at a funeral,

69
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:42,949
they forget all the hatred
they had for the other.

70
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:47,422
They even remember
the good times they had together.

71
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,997
Right?

72
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,332
You have to be kidding me!
No! Please don't do it.

73
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:53,959
Hey!

74
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,564
Let me go!

75
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,700
It's a done deal then.
Let's have a big funeral for Rokusuke.

76
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,140
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

77
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,367
Come on!

78
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:35,866
Hurry up!

79
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:40,740
Is that gold?
There's nothing shiny about it.

80
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,111
They have to melt
that ore into mercury.

81
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:47,178
After that they evaporate it
and only then does it turn into pure gold.

82
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,290
I don't get it.

83
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,120
Well, there is no need
for you to understand it.

84
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:01,332
Oh!

85
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,504
Huh? What are you doing
Hurry up!

86
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,040
If you don't hurry up,

87
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm gonna ask the boss
to let me hold your funeral!

88
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,946
Please forgive me!

89
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:17,183
I'm getting really mad now.
I won't forgive them!

90
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,647
Calm down, Naruto...

91
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:22,046
We don't know anything
about them yet.

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,751
That's right. We should do
what Neji is telling us.

93
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,054
Yeah but...

94
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:29,753
if we don't do something,
that poor old guy is going to die!

95
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,925
Naruto, leave things to me here.

96
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,528
Wait, Lee!

97
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,400
Hey, hey.
Hurry up and pick them up!

98
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,651
Yeah! Way to go, Lee!

99
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,190
Are you okay, old man?

100
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:02,028
Oh my gosh!
What have you done?!

101
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:04,598
Here. Drink some water.

102
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,794
What are you doing?!

103
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,904
I beg you.
Please punch me, kick me.

104
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,338
Please knock me around

105
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,774
like the way you just did
with those guys.

106
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,706
What are you saying?

107
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,645
If you won't do it,
I'll do it myself!

108
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:22,275
What are you doing?!

109
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:23,648
Stop!

110
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm scared.

111
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,422
Just think what they'll do

112
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,083
if they knew I was
the only one that was safe.

113
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,666
What was that sound?

114
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,296
Did they find us?

115
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:45,770
Oh my, that's the sound
of the funeral bell.

116
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,409
Funeral?

117
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,677
Yeah.

118
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:53,845
Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family
which rules this town,

119
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,350
arranges a funeral for
those who betray him.

120
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:57,612
He buries them alive.

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,879
What? They bury them alive?
That's so cruel!

122
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,349
Yeah but...

123
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:08,920
Raiga always cries sadly
during the funeral.

124
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,892
That's one weird guy.

125
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,359
But...

126
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:17,132
That doesn't seem to be
the sound of the bell for you.

127
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:22,002
Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke
was caught this morning, so...

128
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,002
What?!

129
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:04,315
I'm so happy, I remember
the first day I met that guy.

130
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,354
Yeah? That's nice.

131
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:14,351
Yeah... When I told him we were taking
over the mountain from the magistrate,

132
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,265
he was so relieved to be freed from
the high taxes that he was paying.

133
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:26,940
He was laughing out of pure joy...
He was a really nice guy.

134
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:32,473
I like funerals.
Makes me feel nostalgic.

135
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:36,246
Would you put on
a big funeral for me too?

136
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,545
Fool! I'm not putting on
a funeral for you.

137
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,455
You are <i>not</i> going
to die before me.

138
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,953
I don't have to have a funeral for you
to think of the good times

139
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,859
because you are always a good boy.

140
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,729
Raiga.

141
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:54,333
What is it?

142
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,767
They're coming.
They'll show up anytime now.

143
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:05,446
Yeah... I'm excited to see
what kind of help he sought.

144
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:11,042
Okay! Let's save the guy.

145
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,520
Let's do it, Neji.

146
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,620
Okay.

147
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,457
Byakugan!

148
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:28,063
It's all right. He's still alive.

149
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,732
If we can get rid of
the guys around him,

150
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,137
we can save him.

151
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,237
Okay! Let's get rid
of them quickly!

152
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,106
Yeah!

153
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,912
Okay, let's go!

154
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,031
No! Let me out!

155
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:12,945
An enemy attack!

156
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,349
You...!

157
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,887
Tenten, you take the right!

158
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:24,956
Okay!

159
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,100
Gentle Fist!

160
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,879
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

161
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,844
Na -ru -to...

162
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,149
Uzumaki Barrage!

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,059
That's the way!

164
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:08,561
- Watch out!
- Huh?

165
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,097
There are three more!

166
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,337
Here comes the Leaf Village's
Handsome Devil, Rock Lee!

167
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,147
I found the last one!

168
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,025
You are...

169
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,391
Who is this guy?

170
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:35,458
Well...

171
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,330
This is Karashi.

172
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,828
The one Grandma Sansho
was talking about...

173
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,370
This is Karashi?

174
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:50,541
Karashi, was it your own decision
to join the Kurosuki Family...

175
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,978
just like Grandma Sansho said it was?

176
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,439
So what if it was?

177
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:56,814
What?!

178
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:59,546
Sir Raiga is great!

179
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,516
He dethroned the old evil government
of the Katabami Gold Mine,

180
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,821
and he liberated everybody
from the village!

181
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,958
One, two, one two...

182
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:14,529
One, two, one two...

183
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,731
Umm, Grandma...

184
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,331
Oh my...
You are so greedy!

185
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,110
They are fighting their lives
out there by going into the gold mine...

186
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:27,871
Can't you just wait at least
while I'm cooking the curry?

187
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,381
I don't mind waiting but...
I think something is burning.

188
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:34,453
What?

189
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,590
Oh my, oh my...

190
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,217
Oops...

191
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,255
Yeah, it burned...

192
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:45,726
Karashi, did you know that

193
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:50,670
Grandma Sansho worries about you
everyday while cooking curry?

194
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,640
Naruto, leave things to me here.

195
00:14:55,344 --> 00:15:00,782
Karashi, you saved my life
with your curry of life.

196
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,413
If you can make such
a wonderful curry,

197
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,580
how can you stay with the family of
a man with no respect for life?!

198
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:08,856
Why?

199
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,257
Nobody cares to compliment me
even if I can make that curry.

200
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,393
As a man born in this world,

201
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:19,662
I should gain more power and
try to take over the world!

202
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,995
Instead of sitting around in that store
that no one patronizes anymore.

203
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,472
What? I can't take this anymore!

204
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,448
Lee!

205
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:44,919
Karashi, not only did you and
Grandma Sansho's curry save my life...

206
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,495
But you also taught me that
if you make it from the heart,

207
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,895
just one serving of curry
could save lives,

208
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,132
and that even somebody like me
could do anything just by trying hard.

209
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:04,078
You looked much stronger
and dignified then than you do now.

210
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:20,259
<i>Karashi!</i>

211
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:25,557
<i>I've never seen anybody</i>
<i>who tries this hard.</i>

212
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:30,835
<i>I see. You want to save</i>
<i>this boy too, huh...</i>

213
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:48,478
Please promise me...
Please get cut of the Kurosuki Family!

214
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,554
You're right...

215
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,188
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry!

216
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,659
Oh, I'm so relieved.

217
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,569
Hey! Please get me out of here.

218
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,766
It's dark and I can't breathe.

219
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,467
Oh yeah!

220
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:11,569
We almost forgot
about Rokusuke.

221
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,248
Mmm? You guys...

222
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,687
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's all right now.

223
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,654
I'm sorry. Thinking that maybe

224
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:28,059
I could still save my friend
who got buried alive...

225
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,393
I just couldn't stay still.

226
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,533
Yeah, I understand.

227
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,665
Neji, what is it?

228
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,345
What is this?

229
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,787
This feeling of danger...

230
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,216
Hey Neji, what is it?

231
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,153
We are being watched.
It's probably Raiga.

232
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,397
What?

233
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,228
From the top of that cliff...

234
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,594
Okay. Let's go!

235
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:11,799
Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.

236
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,964
All right.

237
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:23,408
No one's here.

238
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,647
Where did he go?

239
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,822
Mmm? What is that?

240
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,756
This mist...

241
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:47,168
Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!

242
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:53,874
Hidden Mist Jutsu...
A specialty of Mist Village Ninja.

243
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:57,482
So, what Guy Sensei said was true?

244
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,282
Damn, I can't see anything!

245
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,351
Neji, try to find the enemy
with your Byakugan.

246
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,958
I've been trying...!

247
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,093
Uh... Can't see a thing!

248
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,369
That's impossible.
Even Neji' s Byakugan

249
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:23,639
that's supposed to let him
see 360 degrees won't work!

250
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:26,036
What's going on?

251
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,682
There isn't supposed to be
a Jutsu that can break Byakugan!

252
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,263
What do you think, Ranmaru?

253
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:48,764
It's amazing...

254
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:52,637
One of them can see through
the Chakra Network.

255
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,510
He probably has some sort
of Kekkei Genkai power.

256
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,240
He can see us?

257
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,576
It's all right,
my power is superior to his...

258
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,076
So, what are you going to do?

259
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:10,614
Everybody in the Katabami
Gold Mine is depending on me.

260
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,996
I'm the one who has to
keep the peace of this village.

261
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,363
Are you going to hold a funeral?

262
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:24,494
No, even if I hold a funeral,
I have no memories of them.

263
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,107
I'll just get rid of them!

264
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:32,609
Look,
Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!

265
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,751
Wh What is it?!

266
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,098
Lighting! Drop!

267
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,338
What do you think, Ranmaru?

268
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,303
It's great, Raiga!

269
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,202
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

270
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:35,674
<i>And you become speechless</i>

271
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:41,674
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

272
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,913
<i>So you don't answer</i>

273
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,616
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

274
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:55,493
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

275
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:57,997
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

276
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:07,202
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

277
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:16,809
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

278
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:25,987
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

279
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:37,799
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

280
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,319
Naruto Barrage! What?

281
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,685
Leaf Hurricane! Mm?

282
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:56,388
Here I come! Huh?

283
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:57,386
Impossible!

284
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,222
Hey! The enemy disappeared!

285
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,761
I have nobody either!

286
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,260
What? There is no enemy!

287
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,596
Neji! Are you using
your Byakugan correctly?!

288
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:07,760
I am doing it right!

289
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:11,770
It's impossible, but my Byakugan
is picking up Chakra!

290
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,365
Next time: "The Enemy of the Byakugan"
