00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:13,937
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,663
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,267
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:57,949
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:04,923
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:17,562
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,366
<i>Please, Sensei!</i>

12
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:13,787
- What?!
- What?!

13
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:22,595
Whoa, my heart, my heart!

14
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,738
Huh? There's nothing wrong.

15
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,769
Hey, it's you again.

16
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,108
To think you'd transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.

17
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,041
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?

18
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:40,616
Shut up! For your sake,
don't be nosing around needlessly.

19
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:46,450
Hey!

20
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,426
You're Yakumo. Right?

21
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:53,557
I want to ask you something
about Kurenai Sensei!

22
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,634
D-Damn it!

23
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,792
This is... the Academy's hallway.

24
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,189
Sensei, please!

25
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:38,072
<i>Yakumo's Sealed Power</i>

26
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,346
Why am I no good?!

27
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,275
Kurenai Sensei?

28
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:50,822
I want to become a Ninja,
no matter what!

29
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,814
I must become one!

30
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,255
I told you to give up.

31
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:56,584
No!

32
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,724
Then I'll just have to perform
a Sealing Jutsu

33
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,462
and seal your power.

34
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,226
Huh?

35
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:05,228
Huh?!

36
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,102
Kurenai Sensei!

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,605
Why?!

38
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,453
S Sakura. Umm, where am I?!

39
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:33,258
As for me,
what am I doing lying here?!

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,298
Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei
got stabbed

41
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,337
and my heart leapt out
of my chest and...

42
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,567
No, that's not it.
Where's that girl?

43
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,007
Where's Yakumo?

44
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,680
It seems you don't remember at all.

45
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,541
You got caught breaking
into a mountain cottage

46
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,106
under special security!

47
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:53,577
Huh?!

48
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,183
The Anbu Black Ops are in action,

49
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:59,281
so you should be thankful
you're alive!

50
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:01,659
Oh yeah!

51
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:06,757
The dream I just had...
It was strangely real.

52
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,368
No doubt it was the girl
in the mountain cottage!

53
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,503
What're you blabbing about?!

54
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,668
I'll inject you with a stimulant
if you don't knock it off.

55
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,466
I can't be doing stuff like this!

56
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,005
Hold it!

57
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,546
The medicine hasn't worn off, yet!

58
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:36,662
Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!

59
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:39,326
Kurenai's already gone out.

60
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:40,324
What?!

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,465
You've gone to the trouble
of getting up early.

62
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,994
So how about joining me for
an early morning marathon?

63
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,403
This isn't the time for that!

64
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,237
Morning marathons are great!

65
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,574
Marathons purge the sweat
and impurities built up

66
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,841
in your body from a night of sleep.

67
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,814
More importantly,
where did Kurenai Sensei go?!

68
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,145
Come to think of it,

69
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,848
she said something about going
to visit someone...

70
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,780
Something about a student

71
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,189
she took care of in the past
being in poor health...

72
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,189
Huh? She went to see Yakumo!

73
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,787
Then at least join me for
some morning exercise!

74
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,795
Morning exercise purges the sweat
and impurities built up

75
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,201
in your body from a night of sleep...

76
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,715
Kurenai Sensei!

77
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,277
Whoa?!

78
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,291
I have something I want to ask you,
Kurenai Sensei.

79
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:45,521
Naruto, don't stick your nose
into my business any further.

80
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:48,062
Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!

81
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:50,265
I don't know if it was
on account of that,

82
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,861
but I just had a strangely real dream!

83
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:53,898
A dream...?

84
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:54,767
Yeah.

85
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:58,372
You said to Yakumo that you were
going to use a Sealing Jutsu

86
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,412
if she wouldn't give up
becoming a Ninja...

87
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,273
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry...

88
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,851
H-Hey. Wait!

89
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,614
It doesn't concern you...

90
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,018
Yes, it does!

91
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,156
Hinata, Kiba and Shino are
all troubled

92
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,823
because you said you were
going to quit!

93
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,132
Doesn't the fact that
you're quitting Squad Eight

94
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:26,599
have something to do with
that girl Yakumo?!

95
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,945
What you saw wasn't just a dream...

96
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:34,972
What...?!

97
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:43,012
I used a Sealing Jutsu and
took away a student's power!

98
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,718
No way. That couldn't be!

99
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,557
It happened over a year ago...

100
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:54,833
By my own hand,
I crushed the dream of a girl...

101
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:58,935
I tutored individually named Yakumo...

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,001
who was trying to become
a practitioner of Genjutsu.

103
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:03,734
No way!

104
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:08,003
I don't deserve to have
the lives of the Genin

105
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,105
in Squad Eight entrusted to me.

106
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,718
But why?

107
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:17,348
Now, get out of my way!

108
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,524
That's the end of this conversation.

109
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:22,793
No way...
But I still have stuff I want to ask you!

110
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,224
I have no choice.

111
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,430
What's happening?!

112
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,914
They won't come off!

113
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:53,284
Kurenai Sensei, that's just cruel!

114
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,300
We're already surrounded...

115
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,935
Make emergency contact
with the village...

116
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,063
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:12,705
There!

118
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:31,688
What?!

119
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:44,841
We're counting on you!

120
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,474
What?!

121
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,589
Hurry... to the Hokage!

122
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:45,564
Yakumo... Come with us.

123
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,495
Geez, that Naruto.

124
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,795
The least he could do is thank me
for attending to him all night.

125
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:25,706
What?!

126
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,555
Isn't it about tea time?

127
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,889
After you've taken care of
these documents!

128
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,754
Why's there so much work?

129
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,630
It's because you didn't take care
of it lickety split, Lady Tsunade.

130
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,367
It's a carrier pigeon for
emergency contacts!

131
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,364
What?!

132
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,207
It's from the mountain cottage
in Satomi Hill...

133
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,776
Something's happened to Yakumo!

134
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,866
There's a possibility that
a person being protected

135
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,029
by the Village Hidden in Leaves,
Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.

136
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:30,106
Head for the mountain cottage in
Satomi Hill and secure Yakumo.

137
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,012
Yakumo Kurama...

138
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:38,541
As I recall, that's the girl Kurenai
took custody of, right?

139
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:43,646
Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo
of the Kurama Clan head family.

140
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,786
Umm, what's the Kurama Clan?

141
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,424
It's natural that you guys wouldn't know.

142
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,995
They were a distinguished family

143
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,999
that wielded considerable power
in the village,

144
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,035
but they're just a shadow
of what they used to be.

145
00:12:57,603 --> 00:13:01,835
The death of Murakumo
and his wife about a year ago

146
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,898
became the catalyst for that.

147
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,302
I hear that the clan fell apart
after that.

148
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:10,342
Does the kidnapping of the only
daughter of the head family mean

149
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,580
that the Kurama Clan's
Secret Jutsu is being targeted?

150
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,053
Well...

151
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,383
According to the documents

152
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,016
handed down from
the Third Hokage,

153
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,328
it seems her latent powers as
a Genjutsu Ninja

154
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:26,296
are extremely dangerous...

155
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,767
In other words, she would make
for a powerful asset

156
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,896
if those powers can be awakened.

157
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,840
That means it wouldn't
be surprising

158
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,604
if there were guys seeking
that power, huh?

159
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,641
After her parents died,

160
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,438
she was kept under
protective custody in the village.

161
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,613
All right. Leave it to me!

162
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:49,177
I won't allow a girl to cry!

163
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:52,190
Might Guy,
the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil

164
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,283
will rescue her,
no matter what!

165
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,690
Sakura, you go with them as well.

166
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:57,786
- What?!
- Huh?

167
00:13:57,997 --> 00:13:59,589
Once we have her in custody,

168
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,633
we'll need someone to look
after her condition.

169
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,093
Only one with experience as
a Medical Ninja can do this.

170
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:06,934
Y Yes ma'am!

171
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,866
<i>This mission is a chance</i>
<i>to show my master</i>

172
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:14,105
<i>the fruits of my training!</i>

173
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,087
Ouch!

174
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,319
Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root
or something?

175
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:30,886
What's this?!

176
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,363
N -Naruto...!

177
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,933
He fell asleep in a place like this?!

178
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:50,714
Nice, Akamaru!

179
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:54,041
<i>Naruto...</i>

180
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,459
He's... caught in a Genjutsu!

181
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:04,118
- Huh?
- Huh?

182
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:11,094
Release!

183
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,446
What...? Sakura...

184
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:29,648
Salty!

185
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:35,217
What the hell is this?!
I mean, was I asleep again?

186
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,919
What're you babbling about?!

187
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,020
You were caught in a Genjutsu.

188
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,591
Genjutsu...

189
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,338
I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei

190
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,465
who was heading for
the Satomi mountain cottage

191
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,406
and I tried to get her to listen to me.

192
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,243
Satomi mountain cottage,
you say?

193
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:56,579
Then Kurenai went alone?

194
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:58,182
Yeah, probably.

195
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,110
Kurenai's in danger

196
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,655
if she went without being aware
what's happening!

197
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:05,348
Huh?

198
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,062
<i>Something's strange...</i>

199
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,538
<i>Someone's here!</i>

200
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,577
<i>Damn it. Was it a mistake</i>
<i>to come alone...?</i>

201
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:29,904
<i>But I don't have the time</i>
<i>to return to the village...</i>

202
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,582
<i>They're most likely after... Yakumo.</i>

203
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:37,580
What?!

204
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:44,358
Oh no!

205
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:08,914
Sorry, but I mustn't allow you
to interfere with our work.

206
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:13,817
Wha?!

207
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,424
You think you caught me with that?

208
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:18,355
What?!

209
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:21,498
You're the one who's caught!

210
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,735
The enemies are also practitioners
of Genjutsu.

211
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,169
I must not lose...

212
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,644
What's this presence?!

213
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,908
They're both caught in a Genjutsu.

214
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:59,057
Yakumo... Is that you, Yakumo?

215
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,144
So you were safe!

216
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,049
Help me!

217
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,361
It's okay now, Yakumo.

218
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,735
I'll protect you, no matter what.

219
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,333
Kurenai Sensei!

220
00:19:57,889 --> 00:19:58,583
Release!

221
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:07,365
You were hit with
a reverse Genjutsu, eh?

222
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,728
I I'm sorry.

223
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:11,597
Just what I'd expect from
a Jonin...

224
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,898
No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi...

225
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:18,965
Stay alert!

226
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,045
We should consider ourselves

227
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:23,081
as being under suspicion
by the Leaf Village.

228
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:24,343
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

229
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,186
<i>The two who took Yakumo</i>
<i>haven't returned...</i>

230
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,419
<i>I guess somewhat violent action</i>
<i>can't be avoided.</i>

231
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,353
Although w e come from
the same village...

232
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:41,623
we will get Yakumo,
no matter what the cost.

233
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,697
Understood?

234
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:43,662
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

235
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,130
Oh!

236
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:48,530
What is it, Hinata?!

237
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,038
Did you see something?

238
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,243
The mountain cottage is
being attacked by someone.

239
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:59,707
There are four out front and four inside
the mountain cottage?

240
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,043
Are two of the people inside
the mountain cottage

241
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,246
Kurenai and Yakumo?

242
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:04,820
I bet that's it!

243
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:08,990
<i>Kurenai Sensei,</i>
<i>what the hell happened?!</i>

244
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,863
<i>Tell us!</i>

245
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:23,271
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

246
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:29,611
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

247
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:39,421
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

248
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:44,019
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

249
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:48,965
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

250
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:53,835
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

251
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:58,808
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

252
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:03,041
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

253
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:07,518
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

254
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:14,924
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

255
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:18,827
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

256
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:24,096
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

257
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:28,230
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

258
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:33,107
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

259
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:37,805
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

260
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:43,947
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

261
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:51,755
I'm surprised...

262
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:53,795
Who would've thought that

263
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,389
the intruders would turn out
to be you people.

264
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:59,195
But whatever reasons you may have,
I won't let you take Yakumo!

265
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,472
The Third Hokage entrusted
this child to me.

266
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:06,202
Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,

267
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:10,779
I will protect this child with
every ounce of strength I have in my body.

268
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:14,844
Next time: "Kurenai's Top-Secret Mission:
The Promise with the Third Hokage"
