1
00:00:01,295 --> 00:00:03,593
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:06,428
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:12,531
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:28,989
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:34,426
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,123
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:40,634
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,161
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:51,802
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:56,842
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:02,288
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,856
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:19,670
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:01,944
Milady, the skies have
begun to look threatening.

16
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:04,949
We should seek lodging for the night
before we get rained on.

17
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,612
I see. Carry on.

18
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,223
Yes, Milady.

19
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,398
What dense fog?!

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,762
We cannot see what's up ahead.

21
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:26,874
What was that?

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,777
Is something the matter?

23
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,479
Lady Kayo!

24
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:54,827
<i>The Mysterious Curse</i>
<i>of the Haunted House</i>

25
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,173
I hear that it happened while the mistress
of the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,

26
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:04,609
was on her way to visit the household
of her parents in Land of Candy.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,944
Attendants from Land of Candy
went out to meet them,

28
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,210
thinking it odd
that their arrival was delayed,

29
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:13,651
only to find that the palanquin and poles
had been cast away at the mountain pass.

30
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:17,888
I am told that Lady Kayo and
all of her attendants have disappeared.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,659
Then, our task is to search
for the Lady, right?

32
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,064
That is so.

33
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,923
Hinata's Byakugan and Kiba
and Akamaru's keen sense of smell

34
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,935
should prove helpful
in this search mission,

35
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,630
and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.

36
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,539
What are you saying, Grandma?

37
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:36,038
That I have nothing in particular
to recommend me?

38
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:37,539
But isn't that the case?

39
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,076
I think that you have
good points, too, Naruto...

40
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,218
Oh! Leave it to Hinata.

41
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,085
Go ahead and list them up
for Grandma Tsunade!

42
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,559
Come on,
what are my good points?

43
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:57,258
Er... umm...
Let me see...

44
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,932
It shouldn't be that hard!

45
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:05,830
I didn't mean to make it
seem that way... Um... well...

46
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:08,741
Hey there, you two.
Are you done?

47
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:11,368
Say, Grandma, there wouldn't be
anything odd

48
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:12,639
happening in this mission, would there?

49
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:14,615
Something odd?

50
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:18,777
That is to say... might there perhaps...
be ghosts involved?

51
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,620
Ghosts?
Are you afraid of such things?

52
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,015
Well, umm, er... kinda.

53
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,718
There are no such things as ghosts.

54
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,830
Stop talking such nonsense
and get on your way.

55
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,965
Which brings us to the question
of where to, Fifth Hokage?

56
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:35,927
Kubisaki Pass.

57
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:39,536
K Kubisaki Pass?
As in the Broken Neck Pass?

58
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,966
I knew I had a bad premonition.

59
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,010
Fool!

60
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:47,240
A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such
things. Get to business!

61
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,741
You're scarier than any ghost!

62
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:51,910
We're off!

63
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,681
Excuse us.

64
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,752
It's always like this with that one...

65
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,459
Lady Tsunade,
Kubisaki Pass is where

66
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,192
the capital of
the Land of Necks once stood isn't it?

67
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,663
The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,

68
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:11,864
which met its destruction 50 years ago,
must still be there.

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,607
And what of it?

70
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:16,306
Ruined castles may be found
just about anywhere.

71
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:19,874
Have you caught
Naruto's cowardice bug, Shizune?

72
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,646
N -No, that's not it.

73
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,393
Oh, this is the spot.

74
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,524
The Broken Neck Pass.

75
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:43,469
It gives me the creeps
somehow, I tell you.

76
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,736
It's started to rain. Let's hurry.

77
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:54,905
It's really coming down!

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,487
A castle.

79
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,880
I hadn't heard anything
about a castle standing here.

80
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:05,388
Somehow,
I have a bad feeling about this.

81
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,826
See, see?! This mission is starting
to seem creepier and creepier.

82
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:11,763
But this may be a major clue.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,167
Let's go.

84
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,997
Yeah. At this rate,
we'll get soaking wet.

85
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:19,401
H-Hey, don't be in such a hurry!

86
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:24,709
What a magnificent castle.

87
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:28,847
Won't it be sort of rude
to suddenly intrude upon them?

88
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,017
It's almost night.
Maybe we'll be causing them trouble.

89
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,846
Naruto, don't tell me
you really are scared!

90
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:36,156
N-No way, I tell you!

91
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,788
Pull yourself together, Naruto.

92
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,326
Let's go.

93
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,931
The door opened by itself!

94
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,271
Excuse me, is anybody home?

95
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,811
The lights are turned on.

96
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,253
Please let us shelter here
from the rain for a bit!

97
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,155
Hey! Wait! Akamaru!

98
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,256
Excuse us!

99
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,697
Good evening.

100
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,661
Something sure smells good.

101
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,999
It's still warm.

102
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,931
Was someone here
until just a little while ago?

103
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,487
What's that?

104
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,449
That's one scary looking guy.

105
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:45,819
I wonder if he's the master of this castle.

106
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:48,921
If he's the master of this castle,
than that makes him a feudal lord right?

107
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,020
If this is the feudal lord's castle,

108
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:52,656
then the area around here
should be the capital.

109
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,294
But this is right on the country borderline.

110
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:57,730
Hey! Akamaru!

111
00:07:58,572 --> 00:07:59,732
What are you doing?

112
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,833
You shouldn't eat that
without permission.

113
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,350
- Naruto?
- What is it?

114
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,548
Don't startle me like that.

115
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,183
Just now, the painting's eyes moved!

116
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:23,024
You moron. How could a painting move?
You're too much of a scaredy cat.

117
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:26,791
The table's set for seven people.

118
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:28,659
So, what of it?

119
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,803
The Land of Honey party that
went missing also numbered seven.

120
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,972
The Lady and her attendants
may still be in this castle...

121
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,540
Let's split up and search for them.

122
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,408
Wha...?
We gonna split up?

123
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,249
Since we're all here together,
why don't we search together?

124
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:46,577
What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?

125
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:51,756
Naruto, stop talking like a kid.
This is a mission!

126
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:56,056
You don't have to scold me so much!
I know that!

127
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,496
Hey! Wait a minute!

128
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,908
I'm just not cut out for this kind of stuff.

129
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:12,078
This is scarier than going to the bathroom
in the middle of the night!

130
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,974
This is creepy!

131
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,731
No!

132
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,700
Not again!

133
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:41,703
Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!

134
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,704
I'm too scared alone, after all!

135
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,281
Do you sense it, too? I'm sure this is
the scent of a human being.

136
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,526
It's here.

137
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,800
There's no one here.

138
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,134
<i>I'll eat you up.</i>

139
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:12,771
Who's that?
Is someone there?

140
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,276
The ceiling...

141
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:20,180
Take that, you.

142
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,388
Look at all these books!

143
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,205
The History of Neck Castle...

144
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,300
This was written a full fifty years ago!

145
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:54,812
"The enemy forces
have already surrounded the castle.

146
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,374
"Our people were brutally
slaughtered and

147
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,784
"there're only few of the soldiers
left in castle.

148
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:05,447
"It seems certain that
I would not live to see nightfall either.

149
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,325
"But my thirst for vengeance
remains in the castle,

150
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:11,230
"and I vow with this castle
to consume every last man,

151
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,466
"every human setting foot
within these walls...

152
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,759
"Signed, Gosa Kubisaki."

153
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:18,534
Consume?

154
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,237
<i>I'll eat you...</i>

155
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:27,536
What is this?

156
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:37,849
Gosa Kubisaki!

157
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:05,910
Crap!

158
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:27,865
Hinata! Hey!

159
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,072
Hinata! Pull yourself together!

160
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,240
Naruto...

161
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,358
Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?

162
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,458
Kiba, Akamaru!

163
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:53,756
A castle that fell fifty years ago?

164
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,498
What nonsense!

165
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,266
That is how the scroll is dated.

166
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,008
It says that everyone who enters this castle
will be eaten alive.

167
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,237
True, we have been swallowed whole!

168
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:08,911
Naruto!

169
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,381
Are you okay? Hey!

170
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,451
That hurt!

171
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,581
There he is!

172
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,620
I I'm sorry!

173
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,693
What is this?

174
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,959
This isn't the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.

175
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,126
I wonder if this belonged
to an enemy soldier...

176
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,862
There's some more over there.
They are different armors.

177
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,608
Those armors bear
the crest of the Kubisaki Clan.

178
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:41,111
Let's hurry up and get out of here!

179
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,622
That's the same armor as in the painting!

180
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:54,791
Could it be...
that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?

181
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,597
Gosa Kubisaki?

182
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:02,266
What's going on?

183
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:06,900
He's melting!

184
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:09,974
What is this?

185
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:12,542
Something smells really sour.

186
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,410
There is something
strange about this castle.

187
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:17,408
Hinata!

188
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:17,950
Yeah.

189
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:22,184
Byakugan!

190
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,987
The whole wall is covered
with a flow of Chakra.

191
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,188
Why?

192
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,758
It's moving!

193
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,568
This wall seems to be alive!

194
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:42,540
What if...

195
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:44,273
Gentle Fist!

196
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:56,122
A Are you all right, Hinata?

197
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,218
Uh huh.

198
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,957
I've seen something very similar to this
somewhere before.

199
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,456
The giant toad summoned
by the Pervy Sage...

200
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,394
from inside its stomach!

201
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:05,724
Inside its stomach?!

202
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:10,061
Then, I wonder if, by chance,
this smell could be... gastric juices?!

203
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,935
Gosa Kubisaki invoked
the Summoning d utsu

204
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,667
before the fall of the castle.

205
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,403
But the thing he summoned...

206
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:20,275
was big enough
to swallow the entire castle whole.

207
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:24,013
From the time we entered the castle,
we, too, have been gobbled up!

208
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:30,855
But, why would this thing go to the trouble
of transforming to a castle to eat us?

209
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,015
I don't know.

210
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:35,086
What was that?

211
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,191
Oh!

212
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,696
H Help!

213
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:48,874
Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?

214
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:50,867
She's embedded in the wall.

215
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,441
We are from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

216
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,776
We have come to help you.

217
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,042
Here, I'll help you out now.

218
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,118
It's no use.

219
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,918
Please hang on!

220
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:10,457
Oh no! This thing is rounding up
all the humans inside here

221
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,658
and returning to its original form.

222
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,568
At this rate, we're in danger too!

223
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,763
Naruto, Hinata,
we've got to get out of here!

224
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,738
Man Beast Clone!

225
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:26,512
Fang over Fang!

226
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,977
<i>I am the castle.</i>

227
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:40,358
<i>And by order of my master Gosa,</i>
<i>I am to eat all who set foot within.</i>

228
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:52,967
Naruto!

229
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,398
Ouch...

230
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,076
<i>I'll eat you.</i>

231
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:04,850
How can w e get out of its stomach?!

232
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:06,376
I don't know.

233
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,552
If this creature was Summoned,

234
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,618
then there should be
a scroll for the contract.

235
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:15,191
If we tear up the scroll, then this creature
should return to the world it came from.

236
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,022
Is that so?

237
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,794
- Hinata!
- Right!

238
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:22,863
Byakugan!

239
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:30,705
Found it.

240
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,944
It's up above.
Probably in the castle tower.

241
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:36,339
How are we supposed to
get up there in this situation?!

242
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,489
The wall's Chakra have
begun to stabilize again.

243
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,222
Who's that?

244
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,197
Gosa Kubisaki!

245
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,601
I won't be fooled again.

246
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:04,232
That, too, is just a phantom
created by the Summoning.

247
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,306
Wait!

248
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,475
He looks different from the one before.

249
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:26,831
Wh What's he doing?

250
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,995
He seems to want us to follow him.

251
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,395
Huh? He disappeared!

252
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,196
Naruto, over there.

253
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:01,928
Oh, it's the scroll!

254
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:08,207
It's starting to act up again.
Hurry, Naruto!

255
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:08,930
Right!

256
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:17,307
This is...

257
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,510
It's the true form
of the Summoned animal.

258
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,919
The concentration of acid is increasing.

259
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,585
Hey, let's hurry and wind things up!

260
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,120
Wait a minute.

261
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,827
What if, when this summoned animal
goes back to where it came from,

262
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:33,661
it takes us with it, too?

263
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,596
We'll just have to take our chances.
We gotta do this!

264
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:39,069
Right.

265
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:43,971
Did that do it?

266
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:45,610
What the?!

267
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:48,539
Naruto!

268
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:49,507
Naruto!

269
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:54,845
Over there, Naruto.

270
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,813
It should be possible
to tear the wall at that spot.

271
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,882
Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!

272
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,855
Rasengan!

273
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:22,344
Naruto!

274
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,395
The lord of this castle must have died

275
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:40,558
resenting the people
who seized the castle from him.

276
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,930
But, he also led us
to where the scroll was hidden...

277
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,831
Then, does that mean that
he decided to let go of his grudge?

278
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,267
Surely that must be the case.

279
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:52,912
What's more, he must have felt sorry for

280
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,914
the Summoned animal that
nobly served him for fifty years,

281
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,974
and wanted to release it.

282
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,053
I see.

283
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:04,856
Then maybe he was waiting
for someone

284
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:07,392
to release the Summoned animal
from its spell.

285
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:10,954
And now, it has finally been able to
return to its own world.

286
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:43,994
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

287
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,498
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

288
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:51,003
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

289
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:54,133
<i>Suggestively</i>

290
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:58,940
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

291
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:05,550
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

292
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:12,114
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

293
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:17,152
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

294
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,327
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

295
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,192
How did it go, Bushy Brow?

296
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,096
Hush. He doesn't look himself.

297
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,858
He sure looks gloomy.

298
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:58,802
The results were bad.
I'd say considerably.

299
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,100
Huh? "Considerably"?

300
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,367
It can't be helped.
It must have been considerable.

301
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,375
Then... could it be that Bushy Brow is...?

302
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:05,706
Yes... I'm sorry but...

303
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:10,715
Then he's considerably...
considerably...?!

304
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:15,186
Next time: "The Third Super-Beast!"
