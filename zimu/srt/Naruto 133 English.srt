1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,410
The cry of the tears! You are my friend!

2
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,460
It is really Naruto?

3
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,460
Which is this force?

4
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,550
And which was this will chakra red presently?

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,220
Is this a monster?

6
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,850
But be to you what with the Juste?

7
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,810
Your friend!

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,440
This is why I said that 
I will not let myself go towards Orochimaru!

9
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,030
This is why I said that 
I will break you the arms and the legs if I owed it!

10
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,960
Katon Goukakyuu No Jutsu!

11
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,960
[note: Fireball]

12
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,380
You finally taken again ace your spirits? Dumb!

13
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,800
If not, I will continue to strike you until you donot can 
to move more and will trail you at the house, Sasuke!

14
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,810
Close it!

15
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,700
What you know about me, 
whereas you had neither brothers nor parents?

16
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,830
You are alone since the beginning!

17
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,570
Then what can you know well!? Hein!?

18
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,540
We suffer because of our bonds…

19
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Do you know only what that made lose them!?

20
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,830
It is true that I do not know anything about the parents nor the brothers.

21
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,540
But…

22
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,670
Today it is me which levels! Eat!

23
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,590
Oh that yes!

24
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,390
When I am with Iruka-Sensei I wonder whether…

25
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,550
Itadakimasu!

26
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,550
[note: Says itself by starting a meal]

27
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,060
A ninja should eat above all!

28
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,610
He! He! Do not eat too either.

29
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,570
… If it is like having a father…

30
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,700
… And when I am with you…

31
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,830
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

32
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,160
What do you want stunned?

33
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,460
I will not lose against you!

34
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,040
Always cause.

35
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,550
Was Héhé, how it?

36
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,420
Release me.

37
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,050
… If it is like having a brother…

38
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,180
Why Naruto?

39
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,940
Why be gone so far for me?

40
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,820
Because it was the first bond which I wove…

41
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,510
This is why I will stop you!

42
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,680
It is Naruto too late.

43
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,850
Much too late…

44
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,320
More no return is possible for me.

45
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,420
Approaches! Naruto!

46
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,880
If it is like that, then I will break these bonds!

47
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,260
To break?

48
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,440
Then why to have put your stringcourse?

49
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,400
I recognize it.

50
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,480
You are strong.

51
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,700
It is because you know the same pain as me, that caused by loneliness.

52
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,820
And this pain returns to us more extremely.

53
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,240
By breaking these bonds…

54
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,370
I will obtain a capacity much more powerful.

55
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,960
Now we fight equal.

56
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,920
But, you will not be able to touch me.

57
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,090
Ca did not change since time.

58
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,140
No matter what I say, it is useless…

59
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,270
Sasuke!

60
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,820
Trève of chatterings.

61
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,990
From now, we will fight!

62
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,700
Approaches!

63
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,080
I see it!

64
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,520
These same movements which were invisible for me presently, I see them!

65
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,530
I see them!

66
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,040
Its movements are completely different!

67
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,050
But it does not matter!

68
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,090
I cannot lose here!

69
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
Shit!

70
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,100
Is my body as powerful as when it was under the influence of the seal?

71
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,320
With the power which it releases when it moves…

72
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,360
… The image of its next movement appears to me very clearly!

73
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,000
As a long time as I will have this sight…

74
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,750
… I will be able to preserve my will chakra.

75
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,880
The cursed seal consumes too much much.

76
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,590
If I can see as well…

77
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,850
I can predict the movements of Naruto.

78
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,180
And to use it with my advantage.

79
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,080
They are not good…

80
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,290
It anticipates my movements perfectly.

81
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,670
Shit!

82
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,770
Finally here you is.

83
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,180
You are sure that it is well by there?

84
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,400
We would make better dispatch us.

85
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,270
I have a very bad presentiment.

86
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,120
Sasuke!

87
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,100
Katon, Ryuuka No Jutsu!

88
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,100
[note: Fire of the Dragon]

89
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,690
Incredible…

90
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,480
Close it, Naruto.

91
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,820
It is already too late, Naruto!

92
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,980
You are so weak, kid…

93
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,410
You should be grateful…

94
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,450
… Towards me.

95
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,620
And towards that which sealed me…

96
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,170
Hokage Yondaime!

97
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,360
What is it still?

98
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,900
What was it?

99
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,860
Even if I can predict his movements…

100
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,280
… Its bulge in different directions will chakra.

101
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,740
As if its will chakra thought by itself…

102
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,580
I cannot follow it.

103
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,710
This will chakra red…

104
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,670
… Ca is not one will chakra normal.

105
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Then really have you after Naruto.

106
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,260
We want to capture it for our group, Akatsuki.

107
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,810
It is an order of our chief.

108
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,520
I see…

109
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,270
Then you have special capacities.

110
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,440
Now I include/understand!

111
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,370
Katon, Goukakyuu No Jutsu!

112
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,370
[note: Fireball]

113
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,810
Its will chakra protects it?

114
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,860
The calm one…

115
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,860
If I keep my distances, I could nothing make.

116
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,830
Shit…

117
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,960
This dumb!

118
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,050
I hardly could dodge them.

119
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,000
Provided that I arrive in time.

120
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,760
It would be said that I do not have the choice.

121
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,140
Eh well…

122
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,640
Since I started to use this capacity…

123
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,310
… I did not know what could arrive to me.

124
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,280
But I the choice, isn't this does not have Naruto?

125
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,040
Very well, you are special.

126
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,760
But you see,

127
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,760
I am special than you!

128
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,310
Sasuke…

129
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,750
Shit, that hurt…

130
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,210
And as if that were not enough, I do not feel my left hand…

131
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,340
It would be said that I cannot use this capacity too a long time.

132
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,310
But I will not give up!

133
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,930
The next blow will be the last!

134
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,890
Next episode

135
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,890
Conclusion, rain of tears.
