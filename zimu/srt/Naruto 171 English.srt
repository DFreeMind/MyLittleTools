1
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:21,571
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:26,381
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,013
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:36,219
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:46,137
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:55,508
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,483 --> 00:01:06,290
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:15,766
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:20,896
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>Infiltration. The Set Up!</i>

12
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,637
How is she?

13
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,785
I don't know why
she suddenly collapsed...

14
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:08,345
I see.

15
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,753
The collection ships depart
in the morning.

16
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,323
We should get back to the inn.

17
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:17,122
But then,
what will happen to Isaribi?

18
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,260
Who cares?
She's the Demon of the Ocean!

19
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,827
But...

20
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:25,032
Naruto, what in the world happened
with you and that girl?

21
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:30,107
Aw c'mon! I told you
a little while ago, she saved me!

22
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,637
What happened?

23
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:09,238
Sorry, my hand slipped.

24
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,181
I see.

25
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,716
I'll clean this up right away.

26
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:19,822
Anko.

27
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:20,887
Yes?

28
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:25,824
The studies here,
the Hokage knows about them.

29
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,625
I understand.

30
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:42,141
So, you're saying that this girl
named Isaribi saved you?

31
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:45,714
Yeah, I owe my life to her.

32
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:50,916
Even if that's so, there's no doubt
that this girl named Isaribi

33
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,221
was one of the people
who attacked us.

34
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:58,188
Our mission is to protect
the government's money

35
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,856
and catch the Demon of the Ocean.

36
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,929
That's right, and no matter
how you look at it,

37
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,405
there's no doubt that
she's the Demon of the Ocean!

38
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:08,272
Yeah, but I think there's some reason
for all that.

39
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,772
I'm going to follow her and!

40
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:11,207
You're talking nonsense.

41
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:14,142
Besides, even if we were to follow her,
we've got no idea where she is.

42
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,771
No, I have one.

43
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,411
Really, Shino?

44
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,841
It's something I heard.

45
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,518
It seems there's one island
in this country

46
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,579
that played a central role in a series
of spiriting away incidents.

47
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,183
Where is it?!

48
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:29,054
A deserted island where
the Demon of the Ocean lives,

49
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,186
Demon Island.

50
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:31,588
Demon Island?

51
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,195
Sensei, are you doing okay?

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,661
Yes, more importantly,

53
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,671
there's something I want to tell you
about the Demon of the O cean.

54
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,571
The true identity of this thing called
the Demon of the Ocean

55
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:45,543
is a human whose flesh
has been altered.

56
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:46,503
What?!

57
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,302
What did you say?

58
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,325
Don't muck things up like that again.

59
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:10,598
Yes sir.

60
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:45,264
<i>She's out, the monster!</i>

61
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,164
<i>What the... ?

62
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,569
- <i>Get out of here.</i>
- <i>You're bad luck.</i>

63
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,938
<i>Take this!</i>

64
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:53,944
<i>She's the one who was spirited away.</i>

65
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:56,406
<i>And why would she be</i>
<i>the only one who came back?</i>

66
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:13,130
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,294
A spiriting away that occurred
ten years ago in the Land of Sea,

68
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,861
but that was not the working
of a demon.

69
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:23,273
Orochimaru kidnapped humans
to use as live subjects

70
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,572
for his research at the time.

71
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,868
Orochimaru...

72
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,845
Is Orochimaru mixed up
in this current matter?

73
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:36,485
Wait a minute.
Orochimaru and tests!

74
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:38,285
Why are you suddenly
saying such things?

75
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:42,990
I have to explain it to you from
when Orochimaru left the village.

76
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,863
Over ten years ago,

77
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:51,493
Orochimaru's desire to satisfy his own
inquiring mind and further his power

78
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,771
was such that he gradually
exceeded the scope of a Shinobi

79
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:59,278
and in the end, got involved in developing
what are called Forbidden Jutsu.

80
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:03,776
<i>How unfortunate.</i>

81
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:09,621
Naturally, this soon became
known to the village.

82
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,156
<i>After Orochimaru!</i>

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,818
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

84
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:23,368
But Orochimaru, who traveled
in and out of country on missions...

85
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:27,864
had several other private facilities
outside of the Leaf Village...

86
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:32,072
So one of those is on Demon Island?

87
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,803
So, the people who disappeared?

88
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,212
They were used for
human experiments.

89
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:38,943
What?

90
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,081
Damn Orochimaru!
What does he think people are?

91
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:44,783
So, what are we going to do?

92
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,489
It's obvious, isn't it?
We get into their hideout!

93
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:50,295
And we have to get
Isaribi back!

94
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:52,860
It's settled.

95
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,766
We'll continue and hit
the Demon of the Ocean's hideout.

96
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:07,268
Sensei, how long have you known
about Demon Island?

97
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:11,674
It's because Orochimaru
was the Jonin in charge of me.

98
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:12,510
Huh?

99
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,155
Tell me when we gethclose
to the island.

100
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:23,225
<i>The pain is gradually getting stronger.</i>

101
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,059
Somebody's coming.

102
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,497
What shall we do?

103
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,100
Do as you please.

104
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,199
Yes.

105
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:40,544
<i>The arrogance...</i>
<i>One day I'll pay him back!</i>

106
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,454
This way.

107
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,682
Hurry!

108
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:03,863
How is it, Shino?

109
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,129
No problem.

110
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,532
Okay!

111
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,578
So, a collection ship
is on the move, huh?

112
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,851
Just the right time.

113
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:24,289
Good work, I was right to send you
back to Mother Island.

114
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,983
What's wrong? You're pale.

115
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:32,822
When will I return to normal?

116
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,764
Like you said, I've gathered
information about the ships

117
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:39,862
from the market
and the village, even the attacks.

118
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,239
So...

119
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:44,037
What are you bringing up, Isaribi?

120
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:49,679
You can't possibly have forgotten
your role as a prototype.

121
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:54,418
As a converted body,
your cooperation in generating data...

122
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:58,085
That was one
of the conditions of the promise.

123
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,686
Don't worry, we'll soon be done
getting data from you.

124
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:07,722
I'll keep the promise...
as long as I don't change my mind.

125
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,199
You understand, right?

126
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:10,430
Yes.

127
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:15,269
Well, if you understand,
go keep our guests company.

128
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:16,532
I understand...

129
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:22,138
You're vicious, too.

130
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,812
There's no sign of'em.

131
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,632
What is this?

132
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,695
Birds, no fish?

133
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,279
Don't move!

134
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:00,417
Too bad, isn't it?

135
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:03,081
Don't mess with Shinobi
from the Leaf Village.

136
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,251
You, little...!

137
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:23,198
Well, well,
aren't these cute kitties?

138
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,488
Is everyone okay?

139
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:39,717
Yep.

140
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:49,625
As always, you people
are addicted to peace.

141
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,937
You're from last evening!

142
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,763
Your face looks familiar.

143
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,572
The Chunin Exams,
if I remember correctly.

144
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,076
That's right...

145
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,213
As I recall, Sasuke's adversary!

146
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,051
The guy who was with
that Kabuto?!

147
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,552
You are correct...

148
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,127
Of course,
I haven't seen him since then.

149
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:21,961
You used a strange Jutsu
to suck up other's Chakras.

150
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:25,499
You're the guy who sucked up
all of Sasuke's strength.

151
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:30,740
Well, all of you, come at me.
I'm different than I was then.

152
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:34,140
Okay, I'll finish you off right now!

153
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,872
Wait, Naruto!

154
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,004
Shino?

155
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:41,418
You go ahead.
Seems like I'm the opponent for him.

156
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:42,479
Huh?

157
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:46,884
His Jutsu is not suited for
your style of close combat.

158
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:50,188
We can't have all three of us stay here.

159
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,129
All right.

160
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,455
- We're counting on you, Shino!
- Be careful!

161
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,233
Wait!

162
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:01,769
Parasitic Insects, eh?

163
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,997
<i>Found'im!</i>

164
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:41,142
Who?

165
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:49,716
Welcome, or should I say,
haven't seen you in a while?

166
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,449
It's you, Amachi.

167
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,526
I'm surprised!

168
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,125
I can't believe you've come back
after something like that happened...

169
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:02,601
Like what?

170
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,034
You don't remember?

171
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,432
Sorry, but I have no business
with you...

172
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,264
Where is Orochimaru?

173
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,636
Orochimaru?

174
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,704
Don't play dumb.
He's here, isn't he?

175
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,483
A Curse Mark responds even
though the operator isn't around...

176
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,518
Stuff like that happens huh?

177
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:25,246
True, Orochimaru was here...

178
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,691
But that was over half a month ago.

179
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,193
No way.

180
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,393
It doesn't matter if you don't
believe me.

181
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,130
So the pain I felt so far...

182
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,227
has been the influence of Orochimaru's
presence here half a month ago?

183
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,368
Wait a minute.

184
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:43,936
Sensei!

185
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,107
You two!

186
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,537
Oh my, you brought Genin.

187
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:50,878
Anko, you're all grown up...

188
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,347
Who is that?

189
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:56,084
Amachi... a Medical Ninja
who partnered with Orochimaru,

190
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,180
and was running
various experiments here.

191
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:03,820
Orochimaru's not here.
This whole incident was all his doing.

192
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,229
Him?!

193
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,198
Hey you! How dare you run
those ridiculous tests!

194
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,037
Ridiculous? This is no joke,
I've devoted my life to this research.

195
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,234
What was that?!

196
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:21,907
Look! This one has the physical ability
to adapt to water.

197
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,478
She combines the ability
to breathe underwater

198
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,314
and the muscle strength
to move freely and quickly.

199
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,879
It's been a dream of mine
for many years,

200
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:32,185
to form a Ninja corps
for underwater combat.

201
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:33,519
This is the first step.

202
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:36,119
A Ninja corps for underwater combat?

203
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,831
That's right, a military corps able
to move freely underwater

204
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,230
that the common person
definitely could not imitate.

205
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,992
When that happens,
we can divide land and land

206
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,766
and completely control
marine shipping routes!

207
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,802
Wonderful, is it not?

208
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,309
With this strength,
I'll stand on top of the world.

209
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:57,941
And I'll make Orochimaru regret
abandoning this research.

210
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,684
People are not your tools!

211
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:04,018
Oh my, you're so young,

212
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,354
you don't understand the greatness
of this research...

213
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,255
Well, you're average guinea pigs
who don't know any better,

214
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,855
so I don't think I want you to understand.

215
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:14,931
Bastard!

216
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,672
That's good, Isaribi.

217
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,443
Out of the way, Isaribi!

218
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:26,943
No!

219
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:37,348
What's wrong? You can't fight
by just running around in circles.

220
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:47,858
Damn it!

221
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,835
Why are you protecting that guy?

222
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:56,038
That guy did this to you, Isaribi!

223
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:56,904
Yeah, but...!

224
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:00,067
But it can't be helped.

225
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,146
This is the only person who can
return my body back to normal.

226
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,250
He promised.

227
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:07,911
Look.

228
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,857
Isaribi...

229
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:18,463
People are judged based solely
on their appearance.

230
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:22,700
People don't dare come near me
just from being covered in bandages...

231
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:26,066
A monster with these scales
would be out of the question.

232
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,172
I want to return to my former body,
I want to be a human!

233
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,175
For that reason,
I decided I'd do anything!

234
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:36,976
You're a human being even now, Isaribi!

235
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:37,674
Huh?!

236
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,679
And yet you join with those guys
to attack and sink ships.

237
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:46,114
Isn't that far more like something
a monster would do?!

238
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:47,954
Stop it, shut up!

239
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:50,318
I I...

240
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,655
I don't want to hear it!
Shut up, shut up!

241
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:56,794
Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?

242
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:03,535
No... l-I'm the same as you!

243
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,103
You're lying!

244
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:08,969
What are you talking about?
You're a normal human.

245
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:12,079
I want to be like you too!

246
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:21,285
Don't cry Isaribi...
I'll properly return you to normal.

247
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:24,993
Watch out!

248
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:35,499
A bulls eye letter bomb.

249
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,975
Thanks to Isaribi doing a good job
of attracting your attention.

250
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,113
S Sensei...

251
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:45,740
I'll leave the rest to you.

252
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:46,780
Okay.

253
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,484
Let's go, Isaribi.

254
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:51,079
Wait!

255
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,626
Don't go, Isaribi!

256
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,458
Damn it!

257
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,833
We'd better take care of
this right away.

258
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,804
Give it up... It's over.

259
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:10,874
We'll make you a guinea pig
for Amachi, too.

260
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,170
Insect clone?!

261
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,245
We're the same
Chakra eating colleagues, after all.

262
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:20,376
It won't be easy to finish a fight.

263
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:28,322
He disappeared?

264
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,928
What is he thinking?

265
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:36,932
There you go!

266
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:38,900
Naruto!

267
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,266
I'm going to strangle you
to death like this.

268
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:54,650
What?!

269
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,990
Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.

270
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,704
All right, you did it, Ino!

271
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:17,432
Damn it!
Let me go, let me go!

272
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,275
That's dirty of you!

273
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,103
What are you talking about?

274
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:23,238
There are no such things as
being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.

275
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,607
And you call yourself a Ninja?

276
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,007
Shut up!

277
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,149
What?

278
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:36,726
This place is collapsing.

279
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,888
They're planning to take care
of us along with the building.

280
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:41,291
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

281
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:44,459
Hurry, the entrance is
already useless.

282
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,901
I thought this place would
be traced soon.

283
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,541
It's an old building,

284
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:55,876
but a damn good tomb
for the likes of them.

285
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,651
One person didn't make it in time?

286
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:05,088
Oh well, doesn't have much of an influence
on attacking a collection ship.

287
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:11,057
Damn! Where's the exit?!

288
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,217
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

289
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,018
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

290
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,624
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

291
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,627
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

292
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,689
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

293
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,267
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

294
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,527
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

295
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,403
<i>The images.</i>

296
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:02,413
<i>It probably will not end</i>

297
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,809
<i>It probably will not end</i>

298
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,658
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

299
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,684
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

300
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,729
<i>Running freely</i>

301
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,359
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

302
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,460
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

303
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:29,439
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

304
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:36,044
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

305
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,316
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

306
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

307
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,694
Well, where's the exit, Shino?!

308
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:53,594
How should I know?

309
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,859
Then, what do we do, Ino?!

310
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:57,060
We just have to stop complaining
and run!

311
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,898
But I don't see an exit at all!

312
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,733
It seems the exit has collapsed.

313
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:01,738
- What?!
- What?!

314
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:03,568
Are we going to be buried alive?!

315
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:04,700
- No!
- Since it's come to this...

316
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,006
- I'll use my Rasengan!
- What're you doing?

317
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:09,444
- How can you be calm?!
- Oh, shut up!

318
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:11,812
You guys step back a little!

319
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,416
Next time: "Despair: A Fractured Heart."
