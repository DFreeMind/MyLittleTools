Sasuke!

22
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,376
Why?

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,421
Why you are scappando via?

24
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,216

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,673
E' faster than before!

27
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,307
The medicine that has taken…

28
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,978
it will have been made with some special ingredient?

29
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,904
Six… truly Bravo…

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,032
When I move, I feel myself indeed strange…

31
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,754
Thing…? Cos ì  to the unexpected one?

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,844
It will be indeed sleeping?

33
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,730
Six falled to us!

34
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,361
It seemed same sleeping

35
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,906
but I did not sleep at all!

36
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,324
This is what it is called

37
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,409
the plan of one shinobi.

38
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,411
Gai-sensei!

39
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,873
Ce I have made it!

40
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,753
Gai-sensei!

41
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,630
I… am....

42
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,106
Six falled to us.

43
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,650
..ancora!

44
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,447
If tasks that I am the type of person who would sleep of the sort in place

45
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,909
you are mistaking of large!

46
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,994
I…

47
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,914
are…

48
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,958
cos…

49
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,501
Why I find myself

50
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,839
in a place like this?

51
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,680
huh?

52
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,765
why?

53
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,142
why?

54
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,698
Sake?

55
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:26,118
Drunk E'?

56
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,995
In this case…

57
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,997
you will feel the pain soon

58
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,916
for like sending to you ò  in the oltretomba.

59
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,948
Eternal damnation.

60
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,826
I do not have enough chakra!

61
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,203
At this rate…

62
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,644
Better not to remain still in water

63
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,854
with this wound…

64
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,751
Why.

65
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,753
..non I succeed to hit it?

66
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,675
Just when I was in the better part of my sleep…

67
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,263
Me you are truly seccando!
You take this!

68
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,686
Ehi

69
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,563
it goes via from here!

70
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,694
That type

71
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,529
of movements they are those?

72
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,157
As it knows

73
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,993
As it will know, the Kenpou is a style in which more it is drunk

74
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:18,373
and more he is become strong.

75
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,958
I know.

76
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,835
To the restaurant

77
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,962
exchanges ò  mine sake for water

78
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,299
and of it single drop has drunk one…

79
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:31,386
What? What you want?

80
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,349
Gai-sensei… I feel myself…

81
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:49,404
to the Neji end and I am resolutions to fermarlo..

82
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,617
You could not stop it alone?

83
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:57,704
If you had fought normally s ì,

84
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:02,876
but I could not hurt my preferred student.

85
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,503
I suspected

86
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:08,549
All this for one drop of sake…

87
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,053
If an entire bottle of sake had to drink…

88
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,598
Its force will be inconceivable?

89
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,977
But still it has not been resumed of all!

90
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,272
I do not know how much its body can resist…

91
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,408
A drunk combatant?

92
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,743
it is before the time that of it I see one.

93
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,204
If not attacks you.

94
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:44,793
..lo to make ò  I!

95
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,255
Its style of attack is too much spigoloso, as usual.

96
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,347
It makes badly…

97
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,018
it is all guilt yours!

98
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,198
I.

99
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,532
are…

100
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,660
… in the spring of the giovinezza!

101
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,292
Unforeseeable E'…

102
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,753
And he is fast!

103
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,184
Tsubaki not Never!

104
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,316
Eccolo!

105
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,488
I do not succeed to preview its movements.

106
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,575
For he to deliver an attack…

107
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,203
And then this taijutsu is rather powerful.

108
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,539
I do not have other choice.

109
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:00,220
My ability is that one to manipulate my boneses.

110
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,309
You have felt from the marmocchio of the cloni.

111
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,520
To put ò  soon fine to your drunkeness

112
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,189
I am not

113
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,066
drunk!

114
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,070
After that you sveglier ò  from your state you trance.

115
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,741
They are not drunk!

116
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,537
I am under-age!

117
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,082
to the boys drink is not allowed sake!

118
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,432
Incredible, it does not find?

119
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,102
This is my innata ability.

120
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,376
Calm.

121
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,171
It thinks to a plan…

122
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,090
I must pull outside

123
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,843
all the possibilities!

124
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,357
with those wounds

125
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:39,653
will not have gone a lot far away, not?

126
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,872
I have caught up my limit.

127
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,957
I cannot move.

128
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,465
Eternal damnation

129
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,509
It has nearly caught up me!

130
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,554
and…

131
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,535
It makes the head badly me…

132
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,663
And this cut…

133
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,209
I suppose pits drunk after all.

134
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,754
That aspect!

135
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,216
It seems that you are not drunker.

136
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,511
This is my innata ability.

137
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,680
Innata ability…?

138
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,184
My innata ability

139
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:56,355
the cellular structure of my boneses consists in manipulating.

140
00:14:56,355 --> 00:15:02,110
As you succeed to kick, I am in a position to creating boneses.

141
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,074
there are approximately two hundred boneses in your body,

142
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:11,954
but I am not limited to that number.

143
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:19,670
However…

144
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,421
A bone is also always a bone!

145
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,799
Once broken, it is ended!

146
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,766
that resistance!

147
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:37,521
They are truly human boneses!

148
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,065
In this case!

149
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,152
Karamatsu not Never!

150
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,598
They are to the limit…

151
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,600
It lacks little…

152
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,269
bastard…

153
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,647
Time makes, when arriv ò  Asuma…

154
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,828
Asuma!

155
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,666
To think that every time can come that is in danger....

156
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,171
This of sure will not happen!

157
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,383
E' useless to think next to things that they will not happen!

158
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,928
Calm....

159
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,066
The odore is going via.

160
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,945
They are but…

161
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,656
You creeds?

162
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,743
Like devil…

163
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,121
Cos ì  is true…

164
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,125
My jacket…

165
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:08,839
From the moment that you have used it, you would not have never recognized your same odore.

166
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,135
Cos ì  you have used it in order to hide your odore?

167
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:17,389
You know well as they work smells to it,
ce not to be astonished if I have not felt your odore.

168
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,393
If you will still divide yourselves

169
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,853
in order to fight to me

170
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:27,024
it will be hard.

171
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,942
Eternal damnation.

172
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,207
Aspetta.

173
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,708
Of hour in ahead

174
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,668
it is mean it.

175
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,298
I must try to resist more to along possible.

176
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,343
My task is to slow down it.

177
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,427
In some way they are successful

178
00:18:55,427 --> 00:19:00,432
to schivare the attacks it gets worse.

179
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,768
But my enemy is not cos ì  weak person

180
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,938
I must use my techniques

181
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,650
Arrival!

182
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,363
Hardly they have been operated, are not to the maximum of my force.

183
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:20,619
But I can perlomeno open the first door.

184
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,290
First door

185
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,503
release!

186
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,506
Omote Renge!

187
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,098
It has used its boneses in order to stop my soccer!

188
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,892
