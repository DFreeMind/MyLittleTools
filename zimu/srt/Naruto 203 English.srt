00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:14,122
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:33,875
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:39,747
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:45,847
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:51,452
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:58,134
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:17,747
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:24,157
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:29,359
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:02,997
Sure enough, I just can't get
into training by myself.

12
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,037
As for the Pervy Sage...

13
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,479
I wonder what he's doing and where?

14
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:24,082
And what happened to him
watching my training?! Damn it!

15
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,030
What's she doing?

16
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:57,314
Wow, are you painting a picture?

17
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:04,919
Huh?!

18
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,829
There's nothing like rain clouds
in the sky.

19
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:23,572
Wha?

20
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:47,896
The Hokage's house!

21
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,942
Hurry! Get a move on.

22
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:03,911
Water, water, water!

23
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:04,814
Right away!

24
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:06,453
- Water Style!
- Water Style!

25
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,148
- Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
- Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!

26
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:16,432
Whoa! You idiots.
Not me, up on the roof!

27
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:17,993
We're very sorry!

28
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,640
Right, keep it up.

29
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:24,298
Yes, ma'am!

30
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,788
<i>As I thought, the thing I had feared</i>
<i>has happened...</i>

31
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:44,485
<i>Kurenai's Decision.</i>
<i>Squad 8 Left Behind</i>

32
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,568
There she is.

33
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:55,202
Hey! Wait up!

34
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,515
Giving us trouble.

35
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,383
Let's hurry up and take her back.

36
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:13,514
Right.

37
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:14,848
Hey, wait!

38
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,019
What're you guys doing?!

39
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:22,393
Anbu Black Ops?!

40
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:26,166
Naruto Uzumaki,
leave this place immediately.

41
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:27,194
Huh?!

42
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,836
As for her, what'd she do?

43
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,707
It doesn't concern you.

44
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:36,971
Listen up. Don't breathe a word
of what you saw here.

45
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,942
Knock it off! Just a minute!

46
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,211
Don't get in our way!

47
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,215
Oh! They vanished...

48
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,261
Damn it! What's going on?!

49
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:57,191
Oh, important documents are soaked.

50
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,126
This will have to be dried in the sun.

51
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,867
I'll take them outside.

52
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:01,930
Thanks.

53
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:06,737
'Morning.

54
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,567
Oh, Kurenai Sensei.

55
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,068
Is the Fifth Hokage in?

56
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,009
Yes.

57
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:19,418
So? Is there no change to your sentiment
about pulling out of Squad 8?

58
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:20,289
No.

59
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,735
Think about it carefully.

60
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,465
Kiba, Shino, Hinata...

61
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,033
You're the one who recommended
those guys lacking in experience

62
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,575
for the Chunin Exam.

63
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,901
You don't care about them?

64
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:45,706
But I must not leave that
problem unresolved.

65
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:47,477
It's my responsibility, so...

66
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,555
That incident was no fault of yours.

67
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:04,498
If the Anbu Black Ops are involved,
then is she a considerably bad person?

68
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,095
Or was she involved in some kind
of significant incident?

69
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,469
What did you say?!

70
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,508
Calm down, Kiba.

71
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:15,139
Kiba, Hinata?

72
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,045
Hey, Shino. Say that again!

73
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,011
Very well. I said it'd be futile.

74
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:25,513
How dare you say something like that...!

75
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,220
Cut it out!

76
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,190
Naruto.

77
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:33,756
Calm down. What the hell's wrong?

78
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:38,631
We in Squad 8 were left high
and dry by Kurenai Sensei.

79
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,361
Huh? What do you mean?

80
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:44,697
You see, Sensei spoke to us
directly about it.

81
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:50,073
<i>My duty is completed.</i>

82
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:54,306
<i>You will probably be provided with</i>
<i>another Jonin in charge eventually.</i>

83
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:57,516
<i>Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.</i>

84
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:58,920
<i>Sensei...</i>

85
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,790
<i>It's written in stone.</i>

86
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:04,961
<i>Our relationship is just that of</i>
<i>commander and subordinate.</i>

87
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:09,230
<i>It's just the team formation changing</i>
<i>as circumstances demand.</i>

88
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:13,395
And that was that.
She didn't even give us a reason.

89
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:17,063
That was that?
Are you guys going to accept that?

90
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:21,301
Hell no! That's why I'm saying we should
march into the Hokage's office and

91
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:26,406
protest why she is removin
Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!

92
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,409
Then this Shino says...

93
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:30,313
I'm saying it's futile.

94
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:35,285
It's because this might be something
she herself decided on.

95
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,524
Pig-headed jerk!

96
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,320
Hinata, what do you think?

97
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,792
I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay
as our Jonin in charge...

98
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:45,994
But...

99
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,368
But what?!

100
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,700
Kurenai Sensei might have some kind
of reason of her own...

101
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:54,368
Umm...

102
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,313
So you're the same as Shino, huh?

103
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,572
No... Kiba!

104
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,417
Just stop fighting already.
I'll do something about this.

105
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:07,213
Naruto, you're not even on this team.

106
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:08,422
What're you going to do?

107
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,154
Leave it to me.

108
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:13,859
I won't let Kurenai Sensei quit,
no matter what.

109
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:25,934
I blurted out that they can leave it to me,
but I don't know.

110
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:27,300
Hm?

111
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,274
Kurenai Sensei.

112
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:33,448
What's she doing?

113
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:37,884
All right, I should ask her directly.

114
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:43,884
Umm, Sensei.

115
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:46,559
Naruto.

116
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,059
I heard from Kiba and the others.

117
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,292
What?

118
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,768
Don't give up being in charge of Squad 8.

119
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,939
They're really depressed.

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,005
That's why you went to
the trouble of coming?

121
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:01,634
Yeah. It seems they really revere you.

122
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,308
I don't know what you heard
from those kids,

123
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:06,610
but I can't do that.

124
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:09,079
I don't deserve to.

125
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,251
Deserve?

126
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,990
Please tell them all for me.
Tell them I'm never coming back.

127
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:17,992
Sensei.

128
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,231
Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.

129
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:28,502
Since it's come to this,
I guess I'll try Grandma Tsunade directly.

130
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:41,112
Naruto.

131
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,447
Sakura!

132
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,418
What is it?

133
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:48,617
Kurenai Sensei says she's going
to quit Squad 8,

134
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,420
so I'm going to try asking
Grandma Tsunade directly.

135
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:54,096
I think that'd be useless... Probably.

136
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,721
It'll be okay.

137
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,959
As for me, I know the place where
she keeps her alcohol hidden,

138
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:01,766
so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune...

139
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,468
What I meant was that she must have
some good reason for quitting.

140
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,602
What? What? By any chance,
do you know something, Sakura?

141
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:09,269
Huh?

142
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:13,116
You know something, right? Tell me.

143
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,510
No, don't know anything.

144
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,651
Come on, tell me!

145
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,779
You're a pest.

146
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:22,119
Would I ever do something like eavesdrop
on someone's important talk?

147
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:24,917
What? You eavesdropped?

148
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,527
Yikes!

149
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:30,397
You idiot. Don't talk so loud!

150
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,472
Yakumo?

151
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,866
Yeah. If I remember correctly,
that's what she said.

152
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:46,041
<i>I am at fault for letting Yakumo</i>
<i>become like that.</i>

153
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,981
No, I'd say instead that she was
fine up until now

154
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:51,316
because I put her in your custody...

155
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:53,951
Shizune, how're the
nursing arrangements?

156
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,226
A three man team consisting of

157
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,285
two Medical Ninja and
one Anbu Black Ops member

158
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:03,129
are keeping a 24 hour watch over her
in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.

159
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,862
Even so, you can't rest easy?

160
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:07,194
No.

161
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,073
<i>I want to take responsibility</i>
<i>in my own way.</i>

162
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,772
Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning...

163
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:18,741
The conditions are spot on.

164
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,983
What was the girl's name again?

165
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,081
Yakumo.

166
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,987
Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.

167
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,419
Hey, Naruto.
Don't tell anyone I said anything!

168
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:32,492
Yeah, I know.

169
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:40,631
<i>If that girl is Yakumo,</i>

170
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,969
<i>then she might know something</i>
<i>about Kurenai Sensei.</i>

171
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,034
Lee, you are not stepping in
deep enough.

172
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:16,364
Right.

173
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,076
<i>Kurenai Yuhi.</i>

174
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,079
I make this request with full confidence

175
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,814
that you are the best practitioner
of Genjutsu in this village.

176
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:44,030
Could you take charge of that girl?

177
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:46,732
Who's this girl?

178
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,399
Yakumo Kurama.

179
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:53,167
You know about
the Kurama Clan, don't you?

180
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:54,438
Yes.

181
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,913
At one time, they were a clan excelling
in Genjutsu

182
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:59,778
and were a power in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

183
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,715
in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.

184
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:05,583
But they haven't been blessed
in recent years with talent,

185
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:08,648
their force has weakened and

186
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:14,186
they have not been able to
turn out Jonin -class Shinobi.

187
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,359
Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama...

188
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:21,233
Yes... She's the only daughter
of the Murakumo of the head family.

189
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:26,205
She has health issues and is
not enrolled in the Academy.

190
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,411
Then you want me to take charge of her

191
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:30,173
and train her to be
a practitioner of Genjutsu?

192
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:31,109
No.

193
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:36,142
There's no doubt Yakumo's latent
Genjutsu powers are excellent.

194
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,444
So much so that those in the clan

195
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:41,821
put their dreams of rebuilding
the family on her.

196
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,818
Was there some kind of problem?

197
00:14:46,863 --> 00:14:49,161
This is just between us.

198
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,460
Yes.

199
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:57,571
Yakumo's parents, Murakumo Kurama
and his wife died, but...

200
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,949
You okay? Don't push yourself too hard.

201
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,078
I'm okay. I'm fine.

202
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:13,319
I'm just a bit out of breath.

203
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:16,817
Listen to me, Yakumo.

204
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:20,152
A Shinobi is not your only path.

205
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:21,123
Huh?

206
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:25,428
You're a girl and you should
have many other ways to live.

207
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,095
I want to become a Ninja!

208
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,774
I heard there's a student named Rock Lee
who can't use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu

209
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,711
striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.

210
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,578
I may not have much physical strength,

211
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:45,010
but I could become a Ninja if I were to
use that power, right?

212
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,714
A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.

213
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,289
I'm not a teacher like Guy.

214
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:54,825
Unfortunately, I cannot train you.

215
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,667
All right, that's all for today.

216
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:05,098
Thank you very much.

217
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:08,142
Take a bath and get a good rest.

218
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,969
Right. Good-bye.

219
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,151
Lee has improved again, huh?

220
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:23,454
I heard.
It seems you're quitting Squad 8.

221
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,318
I have no choice.

222
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,592
Those who develop under me
end up not developing.

223
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,490
It's not like that.

224
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:33,096
Although they're no match for my team,

225
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:37,064
the growth of the Genin in
your team is striking.

226
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,674
If that's the case,
it's not because of my help.

227
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,445
It's the results of their own efforts.

228
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,139
Hey, Kurenai.

229
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,611
What do you think it is that we can do?

230
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:58,122
As you say, Lee growing to that extent
is due to his own efforts.

231
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:03,393
All I did for him was to believe in him.

232
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,669
We believe in our pupils even
at the cost of our lives.

233
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:10,696
We just need to believe in them
with all our power,

234
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,969
and embrace them with all our power.

235
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,637
It's not a difficult thing in the least.

236
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,408
Guy, I envy you...

237
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,918
I couldn't even do something that simple.

238
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,756
Hey, Kurenai.

239
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,192
<i>Believe in yourself!</i>

240
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,032
<i>From where and how are Kurenai Sensei</i>

241
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,072
<i>and that girl from</i>
<i>this morning connected?</i>

242
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:49,872
<i>It would seem to be worth looking into.</i>

243
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,118
That must be
the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.

244
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:08,061
Satomi Hill Cottage

245
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:18,438
The east trap?

246
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:19,672
So it seems.

247
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:21,508
An intruder?

248
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:22,604
Yes.

249
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:27,745
Kurenai.

250
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:33,084
Good work on your 24 hour guard.
I came to visit Yakumo.

251
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:34,817
This late at night?

252
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,291
Yakumo is resting inside.

253
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:43,058
Could you guys step away for a bit?
I want to talk to her alone.

254
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,090
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,697
Don't be long.

256
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,559
I'll be done in ten minutes.

257
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:49,900
Fine.

258
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,581
Nothing but creepy paintings.

259
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,606
<i>Please, Sensei!</i>

260
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:18,956
- What?!
- What?!

261
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:28,163
Whoa, my heart, my heart!

262
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,774
Huh? There's nothing wrong.

263
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:34,939
Hey, it's you again?!

264
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,313
To think you'd transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.

265
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:41,211
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?

266
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:45,650
Shut up! For your sake,
don't be nosing around needlessly.

267
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,054
Hey.

268
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,663
You're Yakumo. Right?

269
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:58,626
I want to ask you something
about Kurenai Sensei!

270
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:04,796
Damn it.

271
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:23,456
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

272
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:29,795
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

273
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:39,605
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

274
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:44,204
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

275
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,149
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

276
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:54,020
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

277
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,993
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

278
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:03,226
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

279
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,702
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

280
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:15,108
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

281
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:19,012
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

282
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:24,281
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

283
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:28,415
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

284
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:33,292
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

285
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,990
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

286
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:44,131
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

287
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:52,781
Why am I sleeping in a place like this?

288
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,646
It's because you trespassed
into the cottage

289
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:55,877
under special security, remember?!

290
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:56,611
Oh, right.

291
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,447
Geez, really...

292
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,683
Just be grateful you still have your life,
the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.

293
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:01,416
The Anbu Black Ops?

294
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,356
That's right, I have no time for this!

295
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:04,757
Hey Naruto, where are you going?

296
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:09,924
Sorry Sakura, I have to ask
Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!

297
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,591
Oh, hey wait! Naruto!

298
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:14,962
Next time: "Yakumo's Sealed Power"
