1
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,353
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:26,383
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:29,022
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:31,623
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,228
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:46,146
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:55,517
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,492 --> 00:01:06,299
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:15,775
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:20,906
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:46,032
<i>The Dark Creeping Clouds</i>

12
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,642
<i>Come...come...come...</i>

13
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,154
The villagers are welcoming us.

14
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:02,315
Everyone seems to be safe.

15
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:06,323
It seems like the Kurosuki Family
ran away in fear.

16
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:22,410
Hey...

17
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,337
Here they come!

18
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:27,405
Naruto! Don't come...

19
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:29,982
If you value your life,
be quiet.

20
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,641
Karashi...

21
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,479
I heard that you were deeply sorry
for your actions...!

22
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:38,620
How could I shamelessly
run back to the curry house?!

23
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:41,390
Now!

24
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:11,357
Did you see that?!

25
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:16,087
Although Master Raiga is not around,
the Kurosuki Family is eternal!

26
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,591
Hey... what are you looking for?

27
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,904
Isn't it obvious? The brats!

28
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,098
Are you referring to us?

29
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:26,770
What?!

30
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,950
What you crushed were our forms

31
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:39,044
made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.

32
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,050
Take formation!

33
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,953
Ninja Art: Black Tornado!

34
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:53,199
Wha?

35
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:41,007
Those were also made by

36
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,108
the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu!

37
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,779
We saw through everything!

38
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,047
Here I go.

39
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,947
Leaf Hurricane!

40
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:21,450
Disperse!

41
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,093
Byakugan!

42
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,172
2 palms! 4 palms!

43
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,006
8 palms!

44
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,075
16 palms!

45
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:48,842
32 palms!

46
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,015
8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

47
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,422
Here I come!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

48
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,030
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

49
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,972
Huh?! Oww...

50
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:15,200
It's already over...

51
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,171
What?! Not fair!

52
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,607
Man! You could've saved
some for me!

53
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:24,144
Just when I thought
I'd try the new Jutsu!

54
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,626
Gosh, you never learn, do you!

55
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:35,395
Karashi, are you prepared?

56
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:37,492
I was just kidding!

57
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,166
How dare you torment us!

58
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,200
You really think
we'll let this slide as a joke?

59
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,940
I couldn't help it! If I didn't listen,

60
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,476
I would have gotten killed
by the Kurosuki family.

61
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,707
In place of the Kurosuki family,

62
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,304
I'll crack your head
with this hammer!

63
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah! Yeah!

64
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,950
I'm sorry...

65
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,381
Please move, Lee!

66
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,981
Please hit me until
you guys are satisfied.

67
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,488
Why you?

68
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:08,560
It's partly my responsibility

69
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,896
that the once kind-hearted Karashi
went and joined a gang.

70
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,196
Yours?

71
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:16,834
Because of me,

72
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,169
he got the impression
that power is everything.

73
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,268
Right, that's right!

74
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,809
Though I knew that it's a bad thing,
I just had to...

75
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,173
You be quiet!

76
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,278
Karashi is still inexperienced.

77
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,784
But he has skills to make curry
that can save people's lives.

78
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:36,850
Please give Karashi the opportunity
to make amends by making curry.

79
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:43,164
If Karashi goes astray again,
then I will...!

80
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,167
Punish him with my fists!

81
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,535
Everyone, what do you think

82
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,304
about letting L ee and Grandma Sansho
take care of this situation...

83
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:02,307
After all, he was just
an underling of the Kurosuki family.

84
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,751
It's not like he directly
attacked us or anything...

85
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:10,716
Let's have Lee educate him harshly...

86
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:12,818
In that case...

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,565
Thank you very much!

88
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,666
Th Thank you...

89
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,732
And with this, our mission is complete.

90
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,463
No, not yet...

91
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:27,039
Huh?

92
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:47,458
Are you all right?

93
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,455
What's the point of being all right?

94
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,294
I can't live alone.

95
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,699
Don't say that!

96
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:58,671
Why don't we just
leave this weakling!

97
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:01,305
Everyone has to live alone!

98
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,137
But don't you need friends
who can help you and stuff...?

99
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:09,579
I'm talking about some basics!
I hate people who are indecisive!

100
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:13,287
I was frail
from the time I was born.

101
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,985
That shabby cabin was
the entire world for me.

102
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,095
I have no memory of my parents...

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,630
I survived only by
the small amount of food

104
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:31,570
that the villagers sometimes
brought me...

105
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:40,003
But even someone like me
had a power that no one else did.

106
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:04,835
Here you go.

107
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,337
Thank you...

108
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:11,474
Is your leg okay?
The one you cut with the scythe?

109
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,110
D-Did I tell you that story?!

110
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,847
No... I kind of found out...

111
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:22,950
How? No one else besides me
came today or yesterday, right?

112
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,819
No, I just saw it from here...

113
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:29,254
Scary!

114
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:33,768
As time went by everyone began
to fear me since I had the power

115
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:37,066
to know what was happening outside
even from my room.

116
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,334
Did you know?!

117
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:44,510
I heard that Ranmaru has
the ability to see everything...

118
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,509
Were we being spied on every day?

119
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,809
Get out of the village!

120
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,553
You monster!

121
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:57,951
And so I had no more visitors...

122
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,024
All I could do was to wait to die.

123
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,623
That's when Raiga saved me...

124
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,272
I see. What a bitter past.

125
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,239
Yes, it is.

126
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:16,966
Hmm...

127
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:22,339
Raigan took me out to
the unknown world.

128
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,182
Ranmaru, try opening your eyes...

129
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:38,662
This is the outside world where
we'll be living from now on... okay?

130
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:40,058
Okay...

131
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:48,402
If Raiga isn't here,
it's the same as losing my body.

132
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,637
Perhaps Raiga became known

133
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:54,739
as one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist

134
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:57,876
because he was able
to borrow your power.

135
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,054
It seems like you two
helped each other to live...

136
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:02,345
Yes.

137
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:04,558
That's not true!

138
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,956
You were being used for
Raiga's evil deeds!

139
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:12,327
I might have been... used...

140
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:19,864
But good or bad doesn't matter to me.
I'm just a sense organ...

141
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:24,008
Then that won't mean
that you're really living!

142
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:25,078
Huh?

143
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:29,577
See, you have to do your best
to live from now on!

144
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:34,014
Firstly, eat the curry of life
and cheer up!

145
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,653
That's right!
You will get nourishment.

146
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:40,628
That will hurt the body instead,
wouldn't it?

147
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,093
Naruto, you can't eat it either, right?

148
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,325
Actually, the more I eat it,

149
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,599
the more energized my body feels...

150
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:54,031
That curry saved my life, you know!

151
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,773
Until the day you're able
to walk alone,

152
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,782
I will become your body!

153
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:02,482
Okay?

154
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,649
I have one favor to ask...

155
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:07,411
Huh?

156
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:26,367
Byakugan!

157
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:41,088
As I expected...
I can no longer see life in Raiga.

158
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,746
Can you see, Ranmaru?

159
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:45,417
Yes.

160
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:52,757
Is this okay?

161
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:53,658
Yes...

162
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,604
Let's go... Mission is complete.

163
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:08,947
Hey!

164
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:13,512
What?

165
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:14,619
That is!

166
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:20,056
One, two, one, two.

167
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:21,820
Grandma Sansho!

168
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:27,027
What's all this ruckus?!
Dust will go into the curry.

169
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,197
L-Lee and the others came back!

170
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:32,703
K-Karashi is with them!

171
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,840
Is it worth the ruckus?

172
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,605
Grandma, aren't you happy?

173
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,475
One, two... One, two...

174
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,651
Your snot will go in!

175
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:50,653
Grandma Sansho! I'm back!

176
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,255
Karashi is here too!

177
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:06,099
M Mom, sorry!
Please forgive me!

178
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,567
Please forgive him...

179
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:11,002
He says he'll devote himself
from now on,

180
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,947
and train to take over
the Curry of Life Shop, so please...

181
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,820
First you gotta eat...

182
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:23,656
Huh...

183
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,858
Wow, it looks good!

184
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,624
If you're not going to eat, I will!

185
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:34,034
I've prepared some for each of you...

186
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:38,365
Oh my, that's a very pale child.

187
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,703
Yeah, can you prepare
some for him too?

188
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,305
Especially mild...

189
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,271
I prefer mild too...

190
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:47,973
Oh my...

191
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,523
Mom... thanks for the food!

192
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:03,393
It's a punishment times 300 curry...

193
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,002
It's spicy, it's spicy...

194
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,865
But it's good! It's good, Mom!

195
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,042
Here, I have some for everybody!

196
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:29,316
It's okay, it's mild.

197
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:37,029
By the way, you were part of

198
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:39,396
the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist with Raiga, right?

199
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,563
Do you know a guy
named Zabuza?

200
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,433
Zabuza... you say?

201
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,430
Uh then...

202
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,733
How about a guy with this huge sword
wrapped with something like a bandage

203
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,005
and has fish eyes?

204
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,873
Oh... that's Kisame...

205
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:55,876
Yeah Kisame!

206
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:59,316
So, do you know what
he's up to right now?

207
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:02,879
No... I heard that he slipped out
from the Mist Village.

208
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,491
I know his face, but I don't know
anything beyond that.

209
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,194
I see...

210
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:14,662
Should I ask Grandma to
make you something else?

211
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:19,303
No, I don't need it...
I don't want to eat anything.

212
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:27,678
Thank you for your help...

213
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,506
Thank you very much.

214
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,381
Make a good village with everyone!

215
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,883
Um... where is Lee?

216
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:42,156
His mission still isn't complete.

217
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:54,132
Please wait, Lee... I'm gonna die!

218
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,406
Okay, let's take a break here!

219
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,338
Let's do 300 push ups.

220
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:02,080
What?!

221
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:12,215
One, two... One, two...

222
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,487
300... all right.

223
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,497
It looks like...
there's going to be a storm.

224
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,538
Even if a real storm comes,

225
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,803
it should be fine if we reinforce it
with these big trees!

226
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,908
Oh my, thanks for doing this.

227
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,410
No, it's our thanks for the curry.

228
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:35,742
Uh uuh.

229
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,646
But compared to you guys,
my Karashi is...

230
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,253
Tenten? I'm worried about
Karashi and Ranmaru

231
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,259
whom we left behind
at the curry shop.

232
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,555
We're okay,
so could you check on them there?

233
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,464
Karashi?!

234
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:04,169
Hey...

235
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,906
Is the Boss really still alive?

236
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:10,013
That Neji person didn't seem
to sense it then...

237
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,117
But I know.

238
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,477
Raigan.

239
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:40,506
Oh...

240
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:47,921
You were everything to me!

241
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:50,420
I was only waiting to die...

242
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,356
when you told me that
we'll live on together!

243
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:12,076
To me, being with you, was living...

244
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:16,810
I won't hold a funeral for you either.

245
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:21,884
Even if it costs me my life,
I won't let you die!

246
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:35,065
Ranmaru!

247
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:42,101
Did you die, Ranmaru?!

248
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:01,719
Karashi?

249
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:41,428
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

250
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:53,006
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

251
00:21:53,748 --> 00:22:04,317
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

252
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:16,502
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

253
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:27,946
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

254
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:39,491
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

255
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:45,259
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

256
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:54,006
What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!

257
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,633
Then we gotta go save her
right away!

258
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,234
Please calm down! Naruto!

259
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,211
Tenten can't be that clumsy.

260
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,874
Huh? But that's what Karashi said.

261
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:04,611
Unfortunately, this might be
some kind of trap.

262
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,118
What? Trap?

263
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:07,688
Karashi...

264
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,149
Well, didn't they get annihilated?

265
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,290
