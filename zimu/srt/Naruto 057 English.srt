2
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,211
Where the fuck is this?!

3
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,612
I was saved.

4
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:52,660
Incredible!

5
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,626
It seems a little too huge.

6
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,079
That's right...

7
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,280
Is this...

8
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,646
a frog, right?

9
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:25,319
Let's see...

10
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,390
No Tail!

11
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:31,984
This is...

12
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,357
not something like this...

13
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,256
or something like that.

14
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,219
It is a true

15
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,032
real frog!

16
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,798
Jump! Fly! Dive! Gama Oyabun Appears!!

17
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,295
This time I see...

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,891
he was able to pull Kyubi's chakura with his own will.

19
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,852
But,

20
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,183
I can't say it's stable.

21
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:02,175
He used too much chakra.

22
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:06,191
And of them all, he summoned him...

23
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,568
I did it!

24
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,847
You little punk!

25
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,743
You punk!

26
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,257
On whose head do you think you are sitting on?!

27
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,931
This is the head of Gamabunta-sama...

28
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:32,890
aka Gama Oyabun! This fool!

29
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,282
Be quiet!

30
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,033
What's up with him?

31
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,166
He's so powerful.

32
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,874
It's been a long time and I want to enjoy the air of the...

33
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,418
outside world, but a wierd kid is making noise on my head.

34
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,343
Hey, Jiraiya!

35
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,526
Where's Jiraiya?!

36
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:06,141
What the fuck do you want from me?!

37
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,574
This is not good.

38
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:13,533
Even I can't deal with Gamabunta.

39
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,766
Jiraiya! Hurry up and show yourself, asshole!

40
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:22,726
It's gonna be a big hassle if Gama finds me.

41
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,742
I'd better get away from here quickly.

42
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,465
Hey, you punk.

43
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:28,625
Y..yes!

44
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,118
Where's Jiraiya?

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,218
Jiraiya? Who?

46
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:38,641
The perverted middle aged man who call himself Gama Sennin!

47
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,111
Where's Jiraiya?!

48
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,680
Scary...

49
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:48,597
If you obey what I say without arguing...

50
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:51,006
I might think of making you my subordinate.

51
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,060
Answer me already!

52
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,368
Yes sir!

53
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:59,031
Ero Sennin is on top of this cliff, Gama
Oyabin! (oyabin = oyabun + naruto's own twist)

54
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,701
At the top eh?

55
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:04,723
Ah... May I ask you one question, please?

56
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:05,879
What?

57
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:09,601
What do you want from the Ero Sennin?

58
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:13,425
That's what I wanna ask him, that Ero Oyaji! (perverted oldman)

59
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:18,823
What's he thinking summoning me at place like this!

60
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,198
Ah... but...

61
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:22,236
What?

62
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:26,789
It's me who summoned Gama Oyabin...

63
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,413
I thought I needed a little help because I fell off the cliff.

64
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,188
Yeeeessss!

65
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:47,576
You punk, I was wondering when you were going to start talking.

66
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:54,672
It's impossible for a little kid like you to summon me.

67
00:05:54,673 --> 00:06:00,058
It's true! It's really true that I summoned you!

68
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,659
This fucking frog!

69
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,157
Just because I've been modest to you,

70
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,018
you're saying whatever you feel like!

71
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:21,764
Because I summoned you, I'm your master! Got it?!

72
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:28,474
What? Who do you think you're talking to, huh?!

73
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,573
A kid who can't drink a cup with sake...

74
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:35,037
is telling Gamabunta-sama that you're his master??

75
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:39,197
You! Shut the fuck up!

76
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,386
I guess they came up on the surface.

77
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:25,064
Wow... Huge...

78
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:31,383
Hey kid!

79
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:35,032
By yielding one hundred steps, no ten thousand steps to you,

80
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,585
and even if you really did summon me,

81
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:46,059
I won't accept you, who easily
fell off from my back, as my master.

82
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:52,498
Anyway... it's been a long time
since coming to the outside world...

83
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,027
If Jiraiya doesn't have anything to do with
me, I guess I'm gonna hang around a while.

84
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,336
Hey, Wait!

85
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,354
Go home and sleep.

86
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,510
It looks like you won't even be fit for my subordinate.

87
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,750
Shit!

88
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:29,479
What're you doing, punk?!

89
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,161
If you accept that I summoned you by me
not falling off from your back, then...

90
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:38,671
I won't get off from here for a whole day even you make me.

91
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,446
What?

92
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,959
And, I'll make you accept that I'm your master!

93
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:47,879
This punk!

94
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:51,548
You grow vain just because I've been nice to ya.

95
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:55,381
Get Off!

96
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,057
Stick with chakra.

97
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't have enough chakra!

98
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,527
Listen carefully, you, Gama Oyabin!

99
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,074
My name is Uzumaki Naruto.

100
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:16,809
Remember me as a future Hokage!

101
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,541
Who cares!!!

102
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:29,037
This is getting very interesting.

103
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:41,614
Sorry Naruto, but I am going back to my "work".

104
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,238
Gathering material!

105
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:15,427
Let's eat!

106
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:19,499
Those guys going to Korean BBQ again.

107
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,987
A reward for training seriously, eh?

108
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:27,338
I thought we were told not to lose sight of Gaara.

109
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,834
Don't worry. Even he ...

110
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,294
won't do anything funny in full daylight.

111
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:40,449
By the way, that Shikamaru is the one who match
up with you at first round, if I remember right.

112
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:43,365
Don't you need to plan something for the battle?

113
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:48,498
I won't lose to a guy at that level... Besides...

114
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,146
Unfortunately...

115
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:57,195
If we took this exam a year earlier,
we could've been Chunin easily.

116
00:10:58,808 --> 00:10:59,519
Don't say that.

117
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:06,645
What did you just say?

118
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:13,765
The Sand village will send three
of you to take this Chunin exam.

119
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:17,894
But it's not for making you pass the chunin exam.

120
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:23,686
It's to crush Konoha village by
taking advantage of the Chunin exam.

121
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,137
Why?

122
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:29,709
Don't we have an alliance treaty between Konoha and Sand?

123
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,470
The alliance treaty is the problem.

124
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,721
What do you mean?

125
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:40,214
I don't think you gennins know much, but...

126
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:44,956
Upon concluding the treaty, that
idiot Daiymo of Kaze country...

127
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:50,304
forcibly pushed forward a military reduction
plan on us, the hidden Sand village.

128
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:54,599
He asked Konoha to do requests, which
should've been brought to us. In addition,

129
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,085
he cut the budget for the village and
the number of shinobi's in a large scale.

130
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:05,758
When a head is stupid, the ones
who suffer is us, the arms and legs.

131
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:12,584
Our village had no other choice but bring up the quality
of each shinobi to keep the same level of military power.

132
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:19,727
That's why a shinobi like you were created, Gaara.

133
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:25,765
Now, the Kaze country is in a very
dangerous situation for its security

134
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:32,908
But that Daimyo and his aids don't understand it.

135
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:38,776
Kazekage sama, who fear the declining
of militar power of Hidden Sand,

136
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:43,866
decided to crash Konoha in cooperate with Hidden Sound

137
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,401
At the same time of recovering the dignitiy of Sand,

138
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:53,279
it's to let the stupid daimyo learn the
importance of security control of this country.

139
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:03,048
If we wait any longer, the Sand will completly
lose the military power to go against Konoha.

140
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,439
There's no other time than now.

141
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,094
This mission is all depnds on your work, Gaara.

142
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:14,699
yes.

143
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,870
Once the plan is carried out,
it's going to be a war with Konoha.

144
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,462
It's gonna be a war again?

145
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:28,583
Breaking the aliance treaty, which was
created with so much sacrifices, and ...

146
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:33,081
again so many people will die.

147
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,851
Hey, Temari

148
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:38,804
Everything is Kazekage sama's will.

149
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:41,191
Kazegage sama's...

150
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:44,507
After all, Shinobi are just a tool for a quarrel.

151
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:51,586
It turned out that the alliance treaty
was just to threat our existance.

152
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:58,428
This is super A rank mission. Do it with care.

153
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,920
Yes sir.

154
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,639
A day seem to be very long when doing nothing.

155
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,552
thats true...

156
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:39,949
Man, this is a tenacious kid.

157
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:07,027
Oh man... Naruto seems to be struggling.

158
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:15,493
He should've used up almost all
of his chakra to summon Gamabunta.

159
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:19,627
Look! Look! It's beautiful. It's a rainbow!  Wonderful!

160
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:24,059
Yes, yes. It's wonderful.

161
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,076
Kaze

162
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,976
Thank you, Baki.

163
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:42,136
As planned, all three safely moved
foward to the final exams, Kazekage sama.

164
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,431
There's no problems about the agreement with Sound, right?

165
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,657
Yes.

166
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:54,803
This is the action plan of the Sound.

167
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,720
You have anything else?

168
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,384
No.

169
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,467
What is it? Tell me.

170
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:16,401
Yes.

171
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:21,417
I would like you to have forces close
to the border pretending to be maneuvers.

172
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:23,198
Only four of us are...

173
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,577
Konoha isn't stupid.

174
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,510
Their Anbu's are moving around.

175
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:32,759
If we do such thing, our plan will be clearly leaked out.

176
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,482
But with the current war potential...

177
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,382
That's why I chose Gaara and the others to go.

178
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:44,920
The recovery of the Hidden Sound village's
dignity is decided by your teams work.

179
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,737
Now, go.

180
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,067
Yes.

181
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:00,528
Just a little bit longer...

182
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,327
If I don't fall off from here until the sun completely sets,

183
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,936
I'm your master!

184
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:11,679
Who cares! You started to say that. Not me.

185
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:14,126
I will never fall off!

186
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,996
Naruto should've already exceeded his limit a long time ago.

187
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,768
It's not a surprise if he fall off soon.

188
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:37,564
It's ok to ignore what the kid says, but it
irritates me a little bit to be underestimated.

189
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,350
I guess I'm gonna settle this already.

190
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:45,216
Kid, what was your name?

191
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:48,515
Naruto! Uzumaki Naruto!

192
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,474
Uzumaki Naruto, eh?

193
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,958
Naruto, don't hold a gridge against me even if you die!

194
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:11,585
Gamabunta is getting a bit stubborn now.

195
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,330
This isn't good.

196
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,805
No! The place where the young girl's have fun...!

197
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,854
Just a bit longer... I won't fall off!

198
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,200
What?

199
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:40,760
Naruto channeled more chakra from that condition.

200
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:55,308
I'm gonna fall!

201
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:21,574
See, Gama Oyabin! I'm still on your back!

202
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,671
I won!

203
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,808
Damnit! He'll die if he falls like that!

204
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,397
What a shame! It was just a little bit longer.

205
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:59,725
I didn't think he would stick to Gamabunta this long.

206
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:23,594
Jiraiya... it's not neccesary...

207
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:28,846
I know that this boy summoned me with his own power.

208
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:34,933
Anyways, this is the first one to
sit on my head since the Fourth.

209
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,454
Indeed, he must be emtpy.

210
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:47,282
I can share my energy, but it's best to take him there.

211
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,085
What?

212
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:38,610
The deserted hospital room.

213
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:40,999
An uninvited visitor.

214
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,485
The vision of childhood days.

215
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,703
A daydream that keeps coming back.

216
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:49,773
When the forbidden door is opened...

217
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,074
He appears.

218
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,928
Next episode. Steal up Evil hand! Hospital room Targeted

219
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,485
Who's the next victim?
