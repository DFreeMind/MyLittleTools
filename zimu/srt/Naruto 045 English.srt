2
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,051
I...

3
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,124
to become Hokage...

4
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,873
can't lose here.

5
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:48,055
You will be Hokage even though you're weaker then me?

6
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,566
I will become Hokage for you!

7
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,310
Transform!

8
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,375
No way... it can't be true!

9
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,616
You can't even do the transform
after three years in the academy!

10
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:11,582
You guys... just wait.

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:16,325
I will become a real Hokage someday!

12
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,919
No way! You become the Hokage?!

13
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:29,043
You don't truly believe you can become Hokage do you?

14
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:31,102
Don't talk so big!

15
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:34,566
You are wrong Kiba-kun.

16
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:57,700
If you fight with me for the Hokage name...

17
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:02,886
...you will be a loser!

18
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:09,306
Hinata's Red Face! Spectators Surprised by Naruto's Final Hand

19
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:22,174
You're annoying saying the same thing over and over again.

20
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:33,689
That's fine... I will make you unable
to stand up. Let's go Akamaru!

21
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,739
I don't get beat by the same hand twice.

22
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:40,077
Take this!

23
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,073
Shit!

24
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:21,114
Even though I've seen this
attack before I can't keep dodging it.

25
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:24,234
What should I do? What should I do!

26
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:39,005
You look like your about to lose.

27
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:45,478
This is easy. Even if there are
3 or 4 of you I can still beat you!

28
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:52,004
You never stop talking! I'm going to finish
you next attack. Let's go Akamaru!

29
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,327
Shit! I need to counter-attack somehow!

30
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,841
Even if counter-attack, I need to
get to Kiba. But which one is which one?

31
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:30,304
What are you going to do Naruto?

32
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:33,310
Naruto-Kun!

33
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,952
ahh! I get it!

34
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:43,917
Transform!

35
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:49,190
I got you!

36
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:58,986
Ahh, I see.

37
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,529
Look closer.

38
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,005
Good! Good idea Naruto!

39
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,065
Naruto-Kun!

40
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:29,065
So if you transform into Kiba the real Kiba
won't know the difference between Naruto & Akamaru.

41
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,651
So he can't attack without thinking.

42
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:36,794
But Naruto-kun can attack either one!

43
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,574
Naruto stopped Kiba's attack. Good thinking.

44
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,377
Ahh I see...

45
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:55,785
...but, I will tell you one thing. I was
surprised but your transformation doesn't work on me.

46
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:02,120
Just because...

47
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,680
... I can smell.

48
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:13,377
Don't under-estimate our sense of smell Naruto!

49
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,610
Kiba can make his sense of smell 10,000 times stronger
by gathering his chakura into his nose.

50
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:28,344
Of course he can tell people apart by smell.

51
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,607
I win!

52
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:33,580
What?!

53
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:42,693
What's going on? Kiba's nose couldn't tell which was Naruto?

54
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:51,188
Shit! What's going on here?!

55
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,930
So this one is Naruto!

56
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,310
What?!

57
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:14,081
That's a pranksters idea.

58
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:15,992
He was fooled.

59
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:33,632
Naruto! Amazing!

60
00:08:56,396 --> 00:09:01,623
The Naruto who transformed into Kiba was attacked
by the real Kiba because of the smell.

61
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:08,856
But Naruto transformed into Akamaru quickly
instead of returning to his real form.

62
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,584
It looked like Akamaru was beaten and his transformation ended.

63
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:21,045
Was Naruto that smart?

64
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,753
It that so?

65
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:33,435
Use your jutsu's after you think.
Otherwise it will be used against you, stupid ass!

66
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,187
Hehe, that's exactly what I told him before.

67
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:46,482
It's a waste of time arguing with him.
Don't fight at Naruto's pace. Calm down.

68
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,570
Calm down!

69
00:09:55,166 --> 00:10:00,970
In fact he can't catch up with my speed. I'm at the advantage.

70
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:10,137
If I look closely at Naruto's movement, I can
get behind him for sure with Shikyaku-no-jutsu.

71
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:16,633
There's no need to worry... if I
calm down, I can win this match for sure.

72
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:22,808
I can see the enemy has already calmed down...
so, what're you going to do, Naruto?

73
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:30,005
Huh... so you're finally in mood for real fight, Kiba?

74
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:37,773
Well then...I will finish this with my super new technique!

75
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:50,765
So, you're finally in mood for a real fight, Kiba?
Then, I will finish this with my super new technique!

76
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:51,885
What?

77
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,441
A new technique?

78
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:58,264
When did you develop that?

79
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:02,307
Still hiding your new technique!  Amazing!!

80
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,751
A new technique?  That must be a bluff!

81
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,543
Try it on, if you think it's a bluff!

82
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:17,427
Damn it... this is same as before...
Don't get caught in his pace... Calm down!

83
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:19,180
Here I come!

84
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,962
Don't know what kind of technique it is...

85
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,107
I won't let you use it!!!

86
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:32,579
Now!

87
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,273
Giju-ninpo
Shikyaku-no-jutsu! (4-legs no jutsu)

88
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,420
Fast!

89
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,164
What are you stopping for?!

90
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:53,588
Naruto!

91
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,565
Hmm... I knew he's just at that level.

92
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:13,428
Stand up! Naruto!

93
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:19,850
Shit... there's no time to channel my Chakura!

94
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,586
Hey, what're you doing, Naruto!

95
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:33,490
Faaaast!

96
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,227
Impossible... there's no time to do it.

97
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,043
Too much difference in their skills...

98
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,522
I guess it's not possible for Naruto...

99
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,037
Shit...

100
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,302
Take this!

101
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,001
What?

102
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,385
This...

103
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:25,527
I will become Hokage...

104
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,120
I can't lose here like this!

105
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,225
Shut up! You can't even catch up with my speed at all!

106
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,451
It's like this when I fight with my real power!

107
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:22,578
Now you understand! To a great man like me, you're are just...

108
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,377
What?

109
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,739
I...

110
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,996
won't lose... Never!

111
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,369
Naruto is going all the way...

112
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,130
If I was Kiba, I'd get annoyed already

113
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:21,100
I don't care who wins anymore...
I just want them to finish up already

114
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,462
Naruto-kun... Do your best!

115
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,252
Naruto! Finish up with your new technique or whatever!

116
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,748
Naruto-kun! Do your best!

117
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,884
I have to stop Kiba's movement somehow...

118
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:47,203
Huh! Your attack doesn't mean shit to me!

119
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:50,299
I recognize only your spirit to fight

120
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,898
He's weak now... I'll finish with the next attack

121
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:58,975
I will show my new technique no matter what!

122
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,399
I won't let you!

123
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:02,872
You're slow!

124
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,031
Take this!

125
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,230
Oops?!

126
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:27,590
The fast movement and strong sense of smell...
Giju-ninpo became the opponent's best hand

127
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,524
Right now, Kiba's sense of smell is
10,000 time stronger than normal

128
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:43,571
Well... that fart must be an
accident. But that's the most unpredictable Ninja.

129
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:47,425
Naruto! It's the chance to finish now!

130
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,617
Oh man... I clinched too much!

131
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:54,881
But! It's time to show off my new technique!

132
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,636
Shadow-Replication no jutsu!

133
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,456
Alright! I'll give you back the pain you gave me at once!

134
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:23,250
U!

135
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,858
Zu! Ma! Ki!

136
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,301
Naruto Rendan!

137
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:02,578
A new technique, eh?

138
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:10,215
He saw the Sasuke's technique earlier...

139
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,437
Shishi-Rendan!

140
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,765
And... the name is also a complete copy.

141
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,366
The winner is... Uzumaki Naruto

142
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:51,559
Yeeees! Good! Alright!

143
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,384
THAT Naruto beat Kiba!

144
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,601
This is a big surprise.

145
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:17,624
I've been ... surely... getting stronger!

146
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,792
Hehehe... Easy! Easy!

147
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:32,598
Wha... what should I do? what should I do?

148
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:44,838
Huh? Oh Hinata? Did you say something?

149
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,513
What's this?

150
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,984
It's a cream medicine.

151
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:11,975
Why for me?

152
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,613
Just take it... Naruto

153
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:30,078
Thank you! You're a good person, Hinata!

154
00:20:34,535 --> 00:21:02,405
Kiba. Don't be ashamed... This
kid was a really strong opponent.
