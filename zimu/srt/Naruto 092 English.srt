Episode #92
Or Not!
The answer of Tsunade

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,410
It is  useless.

37
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,400
Merda. I go…

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,530
You are the only one to being able to recover the arms of Orochimaru-sama.

39
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,830
Why we do not make an agreement?

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,160
Your brother and the man who you loved…

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,350
I can bring back them while still alive.

42
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,890
With a "Kinjustu" that I have developed.

43
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,890
[ Technical Forbidden ]

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,380
You would not want to be of new with they, Tsunade?

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,130
You stop yourselves! Not listened to theirs menzogne!

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,340
Their dreams.... Your dreams. You have forgotten your dreams?

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,530
The village has to you chosen, Tsunade…

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,040
So that it becomes the Fifth Hokage di Konoha.

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,880
In the past the Hokage has always protect Konoha and its inhabitants.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,100
For preservare the things and the village as they were. It was their dream.

51
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,460
They put their life in game for this dream.

52
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,190
You are not held to answer to me immediately.

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,590
However,

54
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,170
We would want your answer between one week.

55
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,550
In order to realize this prohibited technique, there is need of a sacrifice.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,750
You will have to prepare two bodies when it is the moment.

57
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,140
You approach yourselves!

58
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,700
Fairies your game!

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,160
Then, than what you bet?

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,380
Someone? Gone! Played!

61
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,240
I ask myself which it will be its decision.

62
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,280
If it is of agreement with what we have proposed to it, your arms will be recovered, Orochimaru-sama.

63
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,080
Cos ì  we will be able to destroy Konoha.

64
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,940
And Tsunade-sama will be able to find again the persons whom it loves.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,010
But.... If it refuses…

66
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,940
In this case, we will have impossessarci of she with the force in order to recover my arms.

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,490
It will not be easy.

68
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,350
Sai that…

69
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,630
Not there is no reason to preoccuparsi.

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,900
They are the solo to know its force and its weaknesses.

71
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,250
It will accept our conditions, sure.

72
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,970
Well, in this third exercise, you will have to be remembered of all the one which you have learned.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,250
It uses 100% of your power.

74
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:03,380
Like with the football, you make a symbol, and imagines yours chakra focusing to you on that point.

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,710
Still and still in my head, I know it!

76
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,570
But arrival always not to extract correctly the totality of mine chakra.

77
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,670
That technique is useless.... What hopes to make?

78
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,680
It cannot  be serious.

79
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,720
This is because this child says that she dreams to become Hokage and other stupidities.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,770
Tomorrow?

81
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,590
E' be a pleasure.

82
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,720
The old man will return!

83
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,830
You want to still meet Orochimaru?

84
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,450
If it has hesitated to rispodermi…

85
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,370
reason must is to us one.

86
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,640
I ask myself what it has made during one week.

87
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,550
Naruto is not returned, is alarming.

88
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,400
Perhaps I must have an other argument with Tsunade.

89
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,390
Useless…

90
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,960
I do not have… the time....  I will not be able  to make it in time.

91
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,300
This is…

92
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,980
Which thing is happened, Naruto-kun? You are well?

93
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,420
Which thing is?

94
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,800
There is the full moon, you know?

95
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,700
And if a glass were gone to drink?

96
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,790
Tomorrow it is the end of the promised week to Naruto.

97
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,190
I ask myself if Naruto is improved.

98
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,570
Who  can  say it…

99
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,210
Perhaps I would have to order some other thing.

100
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,830
Of the ravanelli, please.

101
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,660
Endured.

102
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,190
Getlteman…

103
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,310
Oh! These have the delicious air.

104
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,040
Tsunade-sama!

105
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,750
Naruto-kun is…

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,690
Its state is critical.

107
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,680
Its right hand has been burnt from the chakra.

108
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,600
In these conditions, it will not be waked up before tomorrow.

109
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,010
Jiraiya had reason. I would not have never had to make this bet stupid.

110
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,030
All and two.... What we go to earn to us to work hardly cos  ì?

111
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,370
That  seems cos ì  stupid.

112
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,790
Tomorrow…

113
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,440
Tomorrow, gone ve I do not pray any!

114
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,190
Why you do not answer?

115
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,460
Tsunade-sama, you answer to me, ve I pray some!

116
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,120
If gone …

117
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,990
Which thing you will make?

118
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,830
Even if I must sacrifice my life, I will stop  to you.

119
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,110
Shizune! To who creeds to speak!?

120
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,020
Getlteman, is morning.

121
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,580
Returned to house.

122
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,430
Cabbage…

123
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,430
Ehi, getlteman, you wake up yourselves!

124
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,840
Ehi! Which thing you have?

125
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,630
If it dulled an unexpected, we would be in the troubles.

126
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,410
Which thing you want that make?

127
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,890
You kill it …

128
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,560
the girl who accompanies Tsunade.

129
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,990
I have the impression that you do not have confidence of me entire.

130
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,340
Since I have confidence in you…

131
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,460
You can be awake on Sasuke-kun?

132
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,020
Much good…

133
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,980
Kabuto, if you want to stop to me,

134
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,860
You must kill Sasuke-kun immediately.

135
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,180
You cannot kill to me, this you know it?

136
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,690
Ehi. Ehi!

137
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,520
Naruto-kun?

138
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,480
Cabbage! Which hours are now?

139
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,810
Not! Which day is?

140
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,210
It is  luned ì....  But…

141
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,440
Which thing is?

142
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,610
You are well?

143
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,400
You would have had to sleep two days at least…

144
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,410
For how much me memories, import the wound little,

145
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,970
A night of sleep is sufficient so that recoveries.

146
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,520
I see. This would be Kyuubi?

147
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,630
It does not import to me, dov' has gone the old woman?

148
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
It is  the day of our bet today.

149
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,370
And on purpose of that technique?

150
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,910
It is not still to point! But…

151
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,160
When the moment will come,  I will use  an other method in order to make it.

152
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,360
I would not have to remain here without to make nothing.

153
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,120
Naruto-kun, remains here.

154
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,600
You are…

155
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,920
Which thing? Eh?

156
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,930
It waits for, Shizune.

157
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,530
Cursed Tsunade.... it has put of the drug in mine sakè…

158
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,860
I cannot concentrate mine correctly chakra,

159
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,630
And my body partially is paralyzed .

160
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,430
I cannot launch correctly not even a Kunai.

161
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,980
Which thing would have made if it had hit to me?

162
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,900
It is  pietoso!

163
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,400
In spite of all continuing to boast you of being a great Ninja…

164
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,330
You are made to fregare with one technical perversa, Ero-senin!

165
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,670
You close the spout!

166
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,030
Even if it is old, is always a specialist doctor.

167
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,940
E' the only person who  can  paralyze a Ninja with the medicine.

168
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,610
In this state, not even a person as me  she can  make nothing…

169
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,970
Jiraiya-sama, as felt?

170
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,080
Better than what you thought.

171
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,850
They are perhaps to a third party of my normal state.

172
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,460
I would not have never thought that Jiraiya-sama was here…

173
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,390
Me I would not be waited for…

174
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,850
I would have to return now.

175
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,220
And in more, Naruto-kun…

176
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,040
us six also you.

177
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,760
Ehi, Shizune!

178
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,260
S ì!

179
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,470
Which type of conversation you have had with Orochimaru?

180
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,870
Only come E' in order to speak?

181
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,900
Orochimaru?

182
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,300
I wanted to believe in Tsunade-sama.

183
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,900
This is the reason for which I did not want to speak of.

184
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,260
But…

185
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,040
We do not have time! Seguitemi, ve I pray some!

186
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,210
I will explain  you  road making!

187
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,940
Much good!

188
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,460
I come anch'!

189
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,920
Which it is your answer?

190
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,240
Which thing?

191
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,410
For this kind of things, the answer would have to be "not!"

192
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,260
Thus it does not go well…

193
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,740
It only lives for its memories…

194
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,810
The worse one that it could succeed, is that Tsunade is made to kill.

195
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,550
Merda!

196
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,030
I will recover  your arms.

197
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,240
But, you warning not to touch the village, if not…

198
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,760
Why not?

199
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,470
Now…

200
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,840
As soon as its arms will be recovered, Konoha will attack.

201
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,410
We must stop it immediately.

202
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,420
Otherwise, the situation will become still more dangerous.

203
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,730
Not jokes!

204
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,030
You are l ì,  not is no need of preoccuparsi.

205
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,010
Which thing means all this?

206
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,350
Six come in order to betray to me?

207
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,540
Tsunade!

208
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,800
The Believe your promised, it' s too hard to give me courage…

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,420

224

Allways, the feel it. The precious Time with you…

225
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,730
One would say that Tsunade has refused the agreement.

226
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,490
Ero-Sennin! Large outbreak has been one!

227
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,550
Cabbage, has been truly strong!

228
