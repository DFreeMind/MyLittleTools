00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,742
Brother.

49
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:45,999
After the school… you could help me to improve my technique with the Shuriken?

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,252

51
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,630
Task is better than it asks it our father…

I say that six more Bravo is with the technique with the Shuriken you… and also it task like he.

53
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,183
He always deals to me like if pits one scocciatura.

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,529
Ouch.

55
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,575
It pardons To Me, Sasuke.

56
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,618
Even the next time.

57
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,511
Today I do not have time to dedicate to you.

58
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,974
You always repeat: "It pardons Sasuke To Me "…

59
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,101
… and you hit to me on the forehead.

60
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,895
It never does not dedicate attention to me…

61
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,189
Not even today.

62
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,867
Father.

63
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:06,079
Why my brother does not dedicate never a po' to me of attention?

64
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,462
Changed E'… lately.

65
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:18,425
It more does not succeed… to interact with the others.

66
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,011
Why?

67
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,347
I do not know it.

68
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,683
I do not understand it, that they are its father.

69
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,727
Not more…

70
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,397
Here, Sasuke. Your lunch.

71
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,985
If you want to train to you with the Shuriken, when lathes to house I to you can help.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,780
I do not have to study…

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,031
I must train to me.

74
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,702

75
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,752
Sasuke-chan, you are going to school?

76
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,172

00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,640
… and it has become Chuunin to 10 years, true?

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,686
It has learned to use the Sharingan when it had 8 years.

81
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,063
Incredible.

82
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,608

83
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,318

84
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,530
On purpose… Sasuke-chan, how many years you have?

85
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,038
I have the same age… of my brother when it has been graduated… unfortunately…

86
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,415

87

113
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,539

Mangekyou Sharingan. (Technical of the Sharingan Kaleidoscope)

126
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,579
My legs…

127
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,386
Enough!

128
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,971

00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,932
It does not make to see all this me!

130
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,352

131
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,895
Why just you, brother?

132
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,106
Not…

133
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,858
Not…

134
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,324
Uncle, Aunt…

135
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,290
Father, Mother…

136
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,125
Stopped, brother!

137
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,461
Those are Papà and Mamma.

138
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,674
Why…

139
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,762
Why…

140
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,680
… just you.

141
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,897
In order to understand… that one of which they are able.

142
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:56,068
That one of which six able one?

143
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,612
Only for this?

144
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:07,120
Therefore you have killed all how many, only for this reason?

145
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,543
I find one valid reason.

146
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,421
Eternal damnation…

147
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,844
Not to say stronzate!

148
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,751
I have fear…

149
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,420
I have fear!

150
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,730
Not to kill to me!

151
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,663
Not to kill to me…

152
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,043
Not task… that of it it is worth the pain.

153
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,088
Stupid fratellino.

154
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,762
If you have intention to kill to me… he hates to me… you curse to me…

155
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:51,767
Above all… You survive in this atrocious world.

156
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:56,480
You run, you run. It grabs hold of you to your life.

157
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,920
We go outside.

158
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,966
These boys… are not normal…

159
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,514
Mhhh.

160
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,765
Itachi-saint.

161
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,560
It would be unpleasant if it succeeded to escape to us…

162
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,565
I could avoid it amputandogli one now leg.

163
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,108
What is saying?

164
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:48,740

165
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,880

Sasuke.

167
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,848
Uchiha Itachi.

168
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,268
Uchiha Itachi.

169
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,151
Just like Sasuke, a Uchiha…

170
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,909

00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:51,303
I have felt to say that the entire Uchiha clan had been exterminated…

175
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,181
… from you.

176
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,184
Uchiha Itachi!

177
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,811
We are to the yield of the accounts.

178
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,612
I must kill a man at all costs.

179
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,909
That man…

180
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,578
Until that…

181
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,665

00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,128
… I cannot die.

184
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,800
This is the person who tried Sasuke…

185
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,052
… what it wants to kill!

186
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,696
As you have said to me…

187
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,574
I have hated to you and cursed…

188
00:17:53,574 --> 00:18:02,207
And in order to succeed to kill to you, I am…

189
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,043
…  they are…

190
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,587
… survivor!

191
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,463
Sasuke!

192
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,387
Chidori?

193
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,890
Hour I will kill  to you!

194
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,900
You die!

195
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,678
What devil has happened?

196
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,890
It has avoided easy the technique of Sasuke…

197
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,644
It goes well…

198
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,649
I must make something!

199
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,695
Its Chakra is forming one barrier.

200
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,657
Hour I understand.

201
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,076
This is the Chakra of the Kyubi.

202
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,245
Not to break off.

203
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,957
Sasuke!

204
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,542
Eternal damnation!

205
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,710
Kuchyose not Jutsu! (Technical of Evocation)

206
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,670
Too much slow.

207
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:36,093
Huh. I do not perceive more the Chakra.

208
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,094
Eternal damnation

209
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,136
Eternal damnation.

210
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,638
Why?

211
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:46,436
My Samehada… nutre of Chakra! It chews!

212
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,444
Not task that you will use more your techniques after that  I will have made  pieces.

213
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,449
What you prefer you before cut… to an arm or one leg?

214
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,874
Why does not exit any neanche a po '?

215
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,542
Useless.

216
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,310
What?

217
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,448
Task that you two.... do not know to me very well.

218
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,284
The great Jiraya…

219
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,828
… when woman has an appointment with one…

220
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,498
… sottinteso that she succeeds in sedurla quickly.

221
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,586
They are not the type that is made to spool from one beautiful woman.

222
00:20:53,587 --> 00:21:01,470
When you arrive to my age.... the women impazziranno.... for your fascination.

223
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:13,899

Sasuke!

252
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,527
Naruto, not to intromettere to you.

253
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,236
But…

254
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,487
But Sasuke…

255
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,530
Naruto…

256
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,449
The only thing that you can make…

257
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:50,454
E' to observe the battle carefully, and not distrarti neanche for a moment.

258
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,497
This is its battle.

259
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:57,628
It means very for he… is all that one for which hour has fought sin'.

260
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:58,378
