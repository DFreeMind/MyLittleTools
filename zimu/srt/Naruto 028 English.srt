39
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:21,191

If you move I kill you!

62
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:52,312
Now they give the coil to me!

63
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,567
Sasuke-kun!

64
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:59,738
Bastard

65
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,461
You will not go far away!

66
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:05,827
Always six in Naruto delay!

67
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,038
I must use the chakra in order to hit it!

68
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:16,212
Bastard

69
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,091
What?

70
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,435
Sasuke-kun!

71
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:27,237
Not distrarti Sakura!

72
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,933
They could it are to us of others!

73
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,933
If it lowers the guard it risks the life!

74
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,540
That misfortune!

75
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,399
I have mistaken to attack them
alone in order to pick them of surprise.

76
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,574
Scappato E'.

77
00:05:54,548 --> 00:06:00,384
If we had ourselves to be separated, not reliable to you
of nobody, neanche of one of we

78
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:05,175
The enemy could use the Henge like little ago.

79
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,010
What we must make?

80
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,721
We will use one order word.

81
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,692
Word of order?

82
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,119
Ascoltate.

83
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,362
If the word will not correspond

84
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:19,040
 you will have considers it like an enemy

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,149
 and fatevi not to trick from the appearances.

86
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:25,618
You listen to me carefully,
repeating   only once.

87
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,084
The melodia of the ninja, "Ninki".

88
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,454
When ce we ask it we answer cos 

89
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,798
"the shinobi it is found to its comfort
in the confusion of the enemy."

90
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:36,800
It must hide and remain in Hush.

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,471
The shinobi it must know the opportune time

92
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,475
 of when the enemy is tired and disattento."

93
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:44,985
This is all.

94
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,971
Okey!

95
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:51,012
You can repeat it of new?

96
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,776
I had said, only once.

97
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,778
You do not succeed memorizzar it?

98
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:58,781
Six stupid?

99
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,326
I memorizzato it to the moment.

100
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,879
Naturally memorizzato all!

101
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,550
I thought you asked to repeat it
an other time in the case that....

102
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,387
Terr   I it parchment.

103
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:14,161
It waits for, Sasuke

104
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,795
What?

105
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,349
Other enemies!?

106
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:42,444
You gone boys to amuse to you laggi.

107
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:45,736
I instead me occuper   of they.

108
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:58,886
Sakura

109
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:00,302
Sasuke-kun!

110
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:01,389
You are behind!

111
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,473
Before the coded phrase.

112
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,961
The melodia of the ninja, "Ninki"!

113
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,896
"the shinobi it is found to its comfort
in the confusion of the enemy."

114
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,442
It must hide and remain in Hush.

115
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,694
The shinobi it must know the opportune time

116
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,615
 of when the enemy is tired and disattento."

117
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,601
Good.

118
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,826
Hey, boys goes all good?

119
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,913
Naruto, a moment!

120
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:27,206
The coded phrase.

121
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,291
Oky

122
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,169
"the shinobi it is found to its comfort
in the confusion of the enemy.".

123
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,840
It must hide and remain in Hush.

124
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,342
The shinobi it must know the opportune time

125
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:41,661
 of when the enemy is tired and disattento."

126
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,522
What takes to you?

127
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:52,566
Stavolta is one that succeeds
also to schivare my attacks!

128
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,278
But what you are saying, Sasuke-kun!?

129
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,989
Naruto has said the word
of order correctly!

130
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,809
This is the point.

131
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:07,775
Naruto would not never succeed
_ to memorizzare one phrase cos   long.

132
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:15,570
According to you what would have answered Naruto?

133
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,829
"You excuse to me I have forgotten It!"

134
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:23,056
In more the movements with which
my attack has schivato.

135
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:26,089
 they are evidently different
from those of Naruto.

136
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:31,127
It reveals your true aspect, impostore!

137
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,848
Not you six fact to trick.

138
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:49,533
But if you knew that she would have forgotten it

139
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:53,620
 why you have not used one short phrase?

140
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,211
I knew that someone was listening
the conversation from underground.

141
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:04,373
For this I have chosen that word of order.

142
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,719
Capisco

143
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:11,306
No fatigue or disattenzione, eh?

144
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:15,175
Six more wide awake than how much you thought.

145
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,232
It makes me to rabbrividire!

146
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:24,430
And then dov' it is Naruto?

147
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,444
U ugh devil

148
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:37,166
They are rolled end here, and

149
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,208
What?

150
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,166
Where they are ended Sakura-chan
and that bastard of Sasuke?

151
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,048
C what

152
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:48,540
Enormous E'!

153
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:53,503
I have not never seen a snake cos   large!

154
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,474
I haul!

155
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:08,425
They are in trap

156
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:27,717
Been trying the parchment
of the "earth". Just?

157
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:31,873
you boys instead have that one of the sky

158
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,689
Hour has beginning

159
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,440
 the battle to the last blood

160
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,858
 for the coil.

161
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,809
Illusory Genjutsu!?(arte)

162
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,068
Not

163
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:42,254
 it was only the projection
of its fury omicida.

164
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,367
Incredible!

165
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,161
I have seen the dead women in face simply
watching it in the eyes.

166
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,753
Who devil is!

167
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,800
S Sakura

168
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,283

169
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,982
 to scappare far away!

170
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:16,581
Otherwise

171
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,651
 we will come all....

172
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,608

173
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:27,829
Sputa me outside!

174
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:31,623
Sputa me!

175
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,545
Damned!

176
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,916
It is put badly.

177
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:40,169
I must think next to something!

178
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,512
Oh, my ball of rice for breakfast!

179
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,655
It has melted

180
00:13:56,655 --> 00:14:01,108
If it has melted the rice cos   in a hurry, then....

181
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,631
Not!

182
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:09,661
You pull to me you pull to me fuoriii!

00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,756
More not succeeded to move to you?

184
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,847
It wants to kill to us!

Still a small effort

189
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,906
Please you move!

190
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,886
What creeds to make

191
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,079
What you mean to make with that one?

192
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,088

193
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,131

196

I only hoped that you would have to me
fact to amuse more.

00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,570
Much evil.

198
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:47,550

199
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,472
Iruka-Sensei

200
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:57,392
 Hokage Grandfather

201
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,069
 Konohamaru

202
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,275
 Kakashi-Sensei

203
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,035
 Sakura-chan.

204
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,950
Sasuke

205
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,190
 I have made many sciocchezze with he.

206
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,851
We hate always an other

207
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:31,757
 but we have worked with against
Zabuza in order to save Kakashi-Sensei.

208
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,986
During the training with the chakra in the forest

Sasuke-kun

217
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,834

You cannot lower
the guard neanche a moment.

236
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:22,654
A preda she would have to scappare
with all its forces

237
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:26,707
 in front of the predator.

238
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,226
