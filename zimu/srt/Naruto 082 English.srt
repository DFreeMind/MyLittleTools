00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,150
In order which reason devil you have caught up to us?

39
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,446
Beh, before I had asked you two to follow them…

40
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,741
But I was being bored…

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,708
What makes in this rinnegato village a ninja us like you?

42
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,424

What!

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,371
Why I would have to follow in one search mission to you, Erosennin?
(Pervertito Hermit)

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,000
Not, normal search mission will not be one.

47
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,671
There is a woman to which I want to turn some questions,
therefore I must find it at all costs.

48
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,716
I do not have time to lose with your sciocchezze from pervertito.

49
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,885
I must train to me !!

50
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,470
To train to you?

51
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,138
Kakashi-sensei…

52
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,433
It must teach many things to me, the Chidori as an example…

53
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,646
In truth it is a pessimo teaching, Kakashi-sensei.

54
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,148
Well, uhm…

55
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,569
Creed that you will not be able to never padroneggiare that technique…

56
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,486
Eh!

57
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,238
Other important thing…

58
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,284
… the woman of which I spoke to you is truly
a lot sexy. You do not want to know it?

59
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,869
For nothing!

60
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:27,165
They are not a boy who makes itself to convince a lot
easy from a EroSennin like you!

61
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,376
However.... NOT !!

62
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,213
Then I do not have other choice.>.

63
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,467
That sin… I know one technical the much most powerful one of the Chidori.

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,097
Task that  I will carry  Sasuke with me.

65
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,017
I have changed idea!  I will come!

66
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,812
I go to prepare the suitcases!

67
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,857
EroSennin, waits for to me here!

68
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:58,238
Eh… E' truly a likeable child.

69
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,796
Its eyes are still the same ones once, in fact…

70
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,091
… she is the true heir of the Sharingan.

71
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,512
This is worse the situation in which we could ourselves be found.

72
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,850
That beautiful surprise. I am not astonished
that you have copied my Jutsu.(Tecnica)

73
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:31,688
Beyond to Itachi-saint other exists qualcun that has the same look…

74
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,651
Its name is.... the Ninja Kakashi Copy.

75
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,445
The surprise is also mine.

76
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,074
The two men suspiciones to the store of dolciumi…

77
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,327
… they are themselves demonstrates to you to be Uchiha Itachi…

78
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,456
… and from the village of the Fog, Hoshigaki Kisame, the searched one.

79
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,628
Well, well… You know also my name. They are honored.

80
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,758
If not me mistake… you six one of the 7 shinobi-katana of the village of the Fog…

81
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,636
… and that large katana must be the Samehada (Skin Squalo).

82
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,892
I have felt to say that six met to you with that child of Yabuza.

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,894
.>.

84
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,027
Task that we will have of that to amuse to us…

85
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,113
Stopped, Kisame!

86
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,119
If you had to meet to you against of he…

87
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,579
… you would remain hurt sure.

88
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:34,126
Moreover, if we lose still other time, others ninja will arrive.

89
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,085
But…

90
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,504
Not to lose sight our objective…

91
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,841
… we have not come in order makes other enemies here us.

92
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,386
Then you say which to us are your scopes.

93
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,607
We have come to try something that it interests to us.

94
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,234
To try.>.?

95
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,718
What been exactly trying?

96
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,767
You are careful, I have said that only Kisame does not have to be struck.

97
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,189
Ninpou: Suiton Suijinheki!
(Ninja Art: Water wall)

98
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,407
That incredible speed…

99
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,117
My eyes do not succeed to follow it.

100
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,538
It has used the shuriken in the right hand like decoy…

101
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,957
… for distrarmi from its Suiton (Water Attack)
that it aimed at my legs.

102
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,376
Much good, Kakashi-saint…

103
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,463
Your intuito one is impressive.... not creeds?

104
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,299
Kage Bushin! (Cloni d' Ombra)

105
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,009
The speed of its Jutsu is incredible!

106
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,430
It was a Mizu Bushin! (Clone d' Acqua)

107
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:16,562
It seems that ninja the copy has learned from ours
village much Suiton not Jutsu. (Technical of Water)

108
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,357
Nice (Well), Kakashi.

109
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,817
You are Down, Kurenai!

110
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,112
This is a Kage Bushin.

111
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,575
Kakashi! Kurenai!

112
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,369
It has made to explode the Kage Bushin?

113
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,333
Technical new tecniche..nuove!!!

114
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,256
Sakura-chan finally innamorerà of me.

115
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:49,052
Kakashi-sensei and Sasuke will be surprises also they.

116
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,230
Kakashi !

117
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,571
Not to lower your guard.

118
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,657
This man has become a commander ANBU when he had still 13 years.

119
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,785
I did not think was much fort.

120
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,456
Not. It has not still shown its true power.

121
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,003
Although do not make part of the Uchiha clan…

122
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,756
You possess the Sharingan and its powers…

123
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:32,054
But you will not be able to never take advantage of its true power inasmuch as a not six Uchiha.

124
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,140
Exactly. It has made center easy.

125
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,229
Why creeds that the Uchiha clan is feared and considered the best one?

126
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,772
The answer is…

127
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,817
Sharingan.

128
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,655
I will show  you  the real power of this Kekkei Genkai.
(To be able inherited with the blood)

129
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,576
It cannot  be… is put badly.

130
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,120
You two! It in the eyes does not watch to you!

131
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,251
You two! It in the eyes does not watch to you!

132
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,677
For no reason you open the eyes, if you made it would be fine yours.

133
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,306
Of hour in then, only someone that has the Sharingan  can  face it.

134
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,268
Even if you possess the Sharingan…

135
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:23,105
…  to my Mangekyou Sharingan you will be able to resist very little.
(Sharingan Kaleidoscope)

136
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,773
In fact…

137
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,778
The Sharingan has one special DouJutsu…
(Technical with the eyes)

138
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,198
The Genjutsu Tsukuyomi is one its prerogative.
(illusory Art of the God of the Moon)

139
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:38,120
In order to strike to me, there is need of someone that possesses
my same Kekkei Genkai Sharingan.

140
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,461
Sasuke?

141
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,150
Without the Kekkei Genkai how much you will be able to resist to me?

142
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,461
This is… a Genjutsu? (illusory Art)

143
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,379
In the world of the Tsukuyomi…

144
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,300
I control space and the time…

145
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,722
… and even the mass of the objects.

146
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:46,146
Beginning from now, you will be subordinate to 72 hours of tortures.

147
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,666
This is....

148
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,168
In the world of the Tsukuyomi…

149
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,171
I control space and the time…

150
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,594
… and even the mass of the objects.

151
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,306
It calm to you…

152
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,934
E' only a Genjutsu.

153
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,313
Not to underrate this world only why creeds illusion is one.

154
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,738
These suffering are real for your spirit.

155
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,245
These suffering are real even if come from a Genjutsu.

156
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:55,799
For how much time your spirit will succeed sopportar it?

157
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:35,547
59 minuteren and 59 second ones lack still 71 hours.

158
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,843
This is…

159
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,725
This is only…

160
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,741
What succeeds arrived Kakashi?E' the moment to open our eyes?

161
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,371
N-Non still…

162
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,706
What has happened?

163
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,793
Six collapsed down without warning hardly he have ended to speak !

164
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,634
Three entire days in that illusion… The Genjutsu is lasted
less than a second in the real world.

165
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,639
But… Why it has not killed to me?

166
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,474
It would have been easy for he.

167
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:15,647
Oh! That Jutsu only serves to stremare the spirit of the enemy…

168
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,986
But for Itachi-saint it would be dangerous to use to along those eyes.

169
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,661
What you are trying… è Sasuke, is not true?

170
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:36,585
We are not trying the inheritance of the Fourth Hokage.

171
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,714
These two… what want?

172
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,934
Naruto?

173
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,685
E' a lot that is not looked at to us.

174
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,482
How many years are that lathes not to visit the village?

175
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,822
Kakashi.

176
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,702
I  of Naruto will take to cure.

177
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:18,919
The task of star behind Naruto you
it has been given from the Third party…

178
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,174
perhaps… but to the state they of the things puts into effect
your level is not enough high.

179
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,260
About what you are speaking?

180
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:34,935
I have controlled the acts of Orochimaru
sin from when it has left the village.

181
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,398
E' clearly that sooner or later it will try
to return in this village.

182
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,736
But this is not the main problem that plagues to me…

183
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,406
That is?

184
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,201
Entered E' to make part of one organization…

185
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,537
Organization?

186
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,291
Which type of organization is?

187
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,378
I do not know the details…

188
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:05,591
Nine shinobi they have formed one small organization
Akatsuki call (Red Moon).

189
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:12,222
Until they have not arranged nothing of worrisome now....
They have continued to collect information.

190
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,891
But the real problem is the members…

191
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,312
Many of they are sly criminals signal to you
in the Bingo Book. (Book of Searches to you).

192
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:22,858
Of they it would only make to become one
mission of S class much difficult one.

193
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,279
To the inside of the organization… there is also Itachi.

194
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:33,202
E' difficult to believe those nine is not
I hand on nothing of dangerous.

195
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:37,956
You must have understood where I want to arrive with my speech…

196
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,423
However Orochimaru has left of recent the organization.

197
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:54,264
From that moment… the members are puttinges in travel in groups
of two learning Jutsu and trying something other.

198
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,769
Tasks are trying Kyubi?
(the vixen to Nine Tails)

199
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,272
E' the more reasonable hypothesis….

200
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,860
After all it is the Youma that possesses the more imposing Chakra.
(Stirpe di Mythical Demoni)

201
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,697
Kakashi…

202
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,991
Naruto must be prepared.....

203
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,286
They will find sooner or later.

204
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,666
This is its destiny.

205
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,672
Of hour in then occupied only of Sasuke.

206
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,467
It must learn to use R-al.meglio its Sharingan.

207
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:35,556
I will take  Naruto with me and I will guide  it  personally.

208
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:46,525
Been trying… Naruto and its Kyubi?

209
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:54,032
You have made the first movement… but you know that
we were to acquaintance of your arrival.

210
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,496
The name of the organization is Akatsuki, is not true?

211
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,500
Akatsuki?

212
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:09,256
Kisame, occupied of Kakashi-saint.
These persons must disappear.

213
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:16,180
Konoha Gouriki Senpou!
(Powerful cyclone of the leaf of Konoha)

214
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,274
Who devil six?

215
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,070
They are the noble green flower of Konoha…

216
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,822
Maito Gai!

217
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,201
I thought pits one wild beast!
(NdT the Kanji of the flower and the beast is similar)

218
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,911
The thing is made interesting.

219
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,246
Not to underrate it.

220
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,999
As I thought… Itachi.

221
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,177
It watches as they have reduced Kakashi…

222
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,721
Not to watch in the eyes of Itachi, Gai.

223
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,348
You will come caught in its Jutsu.

224
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,975
I know very well.

225
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,561
Considering that I trained myself with Kakashi…

226
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,523
They are accustomed to fight an adversary who uses the Sharingan.

227
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,818
You two… open the eyes.

228
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,112
But…

229
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:18,867
When you fight against a Sharingan, you must
to only avoid to watch it in the eyes.

230
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:23,580
The better trick is to concentrate the look
on its feet, in order to foretell the movements.

231
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,751
To think to us well, your reasoning is corrected…

232
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,672
But you the six only one who succeed to make one similar what.

233
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:38,136
Well. I must teach an other trick to you in order to understand
the movements of the enemy solo from its feet…

234
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,639
But we do not have time in this moment enough.

235
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,724
In order now, we think the enemy!

236
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:44,977
What we make?

237
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,813
Kurenai, you Kakashi door in hospital.

238
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,899
Asuma, you cover to me.

239
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,733
He goes well.

240
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,865
In order now, until that they will not arrive
he reinforces ANBU that I have called…

241
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,576
… we will hold them to we attend… two.

242
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,162
Interesting… Six truly kind one.

243
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,291
Kisame. We withdraw ourselves.

244
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,253
We have not come in order to begin one here war.

245
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,381
Ill-fatedly… ogni ulterior effort would not have sense.

246
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,257
Ce we go some.

247
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,470
I was in order to begin to amuse to me…

248
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,890
… it does not have sense however.

249
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,695
Ready!

250
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,290
