1
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,738
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,579
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:29,850
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,055
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:40,430
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:45,804
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:49,399
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,778
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,781
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,849 --> 00:01:00,149
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,617
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:08,491
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,232
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:14,564
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:19,435
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:21,701
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:24,242
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,677
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:47,294
<i>Deep Cover?!</i>
<i>A Super S Rank Mission</i>

21
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,144
It could be that way...

22
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:13,354
Sure enough, Ichiraku ramen is
the best for getting energized!

23
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,092
One more, Pops!

24
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:18,093
Coming right up!

25
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:23,526
Huh?

26
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,905
One more, you said, eh...?

27
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:32,604
Just when I thought you'd snuck out of
your hospital room

28
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,442
and were doing some training...

29
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,479
You guys want some, too?

30
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,488
Pop, here's the tab.

31
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,416
Thanks for your business!

32
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,988
Jeez, I'm fine!

33
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:55,364
Naruto, even if it looks like you've healed
on the surface, you're still battered.

34
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:02,265
It's not like that!
I have to train and get stronger!

35
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:05,402
Yeah yeah,
after you've healed completely.

36
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:10,139
Damn it! I have to keep my promise
to Sakura without further delay!

37
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:20,421
<i>Sakura... You're so pathetic.</i>

38
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,860
<i>Naruto...This is a...</i>
<i>once in a lifetime request...</i>

39
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:33,470
<i>Please bring...</i>
<i>please bring Sasuke back.</i>

40
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:43,942
<i>I couldn't do it!</i>
<i>I wasn't able to stop Sasuke!</i>

41
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:52,350
<i>At this point, the only person who</i>
<i>would be able to stop Sasuke...</i>

42
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,893
<i>who would be able to save him...</i>

43
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:58,862
<i>Is you...Naruto...</i>

44
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:09,271
<i>All I did...was cry...</i>
<i>All I did was totally rely on Naruto.</i>

45
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,868
<i>I didn't do anything myself.</i>

46
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:19,007
<i>Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke</i>
<i>even if it meant his life...</i>

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,197
<i>What can I do for Sasuke now... ?

48
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,202
<i>I just have to put my life on the line</i>
<i>and do it!</i>

49
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,010
It's futile. The ropes are made
of a maiden's black hair.

50
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,144
And the knot is a Shinobi
reverse butterfly knot.

51
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:58,583
It won't be easily untied.

52
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,060
Give me a break.

53
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:06,894
I have to start training as soon as possible
and get stronger.

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,967
Then do as the Medical Corps says
and rest quietly.

55
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:15,032
Come in.

56
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:20,841
Oh...

57
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,509
Sorry, Sakura...

58
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,776
I'd like to get moving immediately
if possible, but...

59
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:35,653
He has astonishing recuperative power,
but overdoing it is a big no no.

60
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,889
I'm okay!

61
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:40,127
Be a little more patient!

62
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:59,111
Just wait a little longer!
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

63
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:01,819
No...

64
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:04,254
It's okay...

65
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,985
Up until now,
I was totally reliant on you...

66
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,491
and I did nothing, so...

67
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,464
What's the matter, Sakura...?

68
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:13,926
Did something happen?!

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,296
No... I'm was relieved
to see you doing well.

70
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,320
This time, <i>I'll</i> do my best.

71
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,542
Sakura...?

72
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,301
I heard you snuck out of the hospital.

73
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,010
Do you want to train that badly?

74
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,748
Pervy Sage...? My... apple!

75
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:08,420
Well well, things look
like they're going smoothly.

76
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,452
Don't you worry.
I'll train you hard right away.

77
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:14,752
Umm... about the training.

78
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,355
I was wondering if you could
wait a little while longer.

79
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,360
Hmm?

80
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:20,830
I'm not saying I don't want to train.

81
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:26,328
But I remembered some
odds and ends I need to take care of.

82
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:27,904
Oh?

83
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,102
Odds and ends, huh?

84
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,443
Come on. Please?

85
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,253
Come in!

86
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:56,059
Oh, I've been spotted, huh?

87
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:58,493
I'm guessing, you want to peep?

88
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:02,098
No matter how long you wait,
I won't show anything.

89
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,836
Wh Who'd peep at an old lady?!

90
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:09,279
N -No, I take that back!

91
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:15,512
Actually, I've come to make
an earnest request to you as the Hokage.

92
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,253
Talk.

93
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,400
<i>This time, I'll do my best.</i>

94
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,741
It couldn't be that Sakura's going to...

95
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,988
<i>This might be...my last look...</i>

96
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:32,559
Sakura...

97
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:36,535
How did you?

98
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,705
I know what you're thinking!

99
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:49,314
That there'd be nothing
I could do even if I were to go...!

100
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,613
But I hate myself just standing here
doing nothing!

101
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:59,149
Always being a hindrance to
and taking advantage of everyone...

102
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,652
Not being able to do
one single thing respectably...

103
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:04,923
It's useless to stop me!

104
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,432
I won't stop you...

105
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,964
You should do it until you're satisfied.

106
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:14,966
But... I'm going, too.

107
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,472
But...

108
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,044
It's become just the two of us...

109
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,938
But we're a three-man squad, right?

110
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:27,850
Yeah.

111
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,614
You guys...

112
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,749
Oops! Pervy Sage?

113
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:41,890
<i>This person...is Jiraiya,</i>
<i>one of the legendary Sannin?</i>

114
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,833
If you, without permission,

115
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:47,668
go out past the border of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

116
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,609
you know at least that you'll be sent
to prison as Rogue Ninja, right?

117
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,675
It's no use stopping us!

118
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:57,939
I won't stop you.

119
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,747
You've been given a mission
by Lady Hokage.

120
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,359
You're to investigate and report
on the Land of Rice Paddies

121
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:11,021
where the Village Hidden in Sound is
and where Sasuke has been taken away.

122
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:15,159
The mission is set to be carried out
in a group of three.

123
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:20,097
As of now, you will work under me.
You got a problem?!

124
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:36,919
<i>It seems they're the biggest of fools.</i>

125
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,655
They won't stop even if you tried.

126
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:46,589
At this rate,
we'll lose two important subordinates!

127
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,335
You'll recognize it as a special mission

128
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:55,362
with the goal of investigating
the Village Hidden in Sound, right?

129
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:00,506
I have no choice, huh...?

130
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,873
But I have a condition.

131
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:08,744
Bring the two back alive. Got it?

132
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:12,724
Sure, even if it costs my life.

133
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:20,091
<i>It's too dangerous of a mission even</i>
<i>with that Jiraiya going with them...</i>

134
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,074
<i>Sasuke...</i>

135
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:59,596
That's the Land of Rice Paddies where
the Village Hidden in the Sound is.

136
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,432
It's that Orochimaru's headquarters.

137
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,677
Take sufficient caution and proceed.

138
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:12,814
It's kind of anticlimactic...

139
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:17,350
Here I thought a bunch of
Orochimaru's followers would greet us!

140
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,156
Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?

141
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:23,819
It seems to be a peaceful,
quiet and nice land, but...

142
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:28,626
No, we still haven't entered
Village Hidden in the Sound.

143
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,696
This is the Land of Rice Paddies.

144
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,859
Land of Rice Paddies?

145
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:34,131
It's a small land that's nothing special.

146
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:38,438
The feudal lord was a foolish lord who
hungered for powerful military strength

147
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,674
in order to make the land
disproportionately larger.

148
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:47,951
And then Orochimaru probably won favor
with some fast talking...

149
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:53,220
Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn't
thinking about making the land stronger.

150
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:58,730
He just had an ambition to make himself
stronger and to carry out revenge...

151
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:03,492
That's why there's nothing in this area
that points to his presence.

152
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,066
Really? And so, Pervy Sage...!

153
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,470
Don't call me Pervy Sage!

154
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,501
That's right...
He's one of the legendary Sannin, so...

155
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,544
He's just a lady loving
perverted Pervy Sage!

156
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,805
What?!

157
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:23,788
More importantly,
where's the Village Hidden in the Sound?

158
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,547
Beats me... I don't know...

159
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,523
What?!

160
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:31,895
We don't know where it is,
so we're going to investigate, right?

161
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,727
You've got a point, but...

162
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,499
But how do we find it?

163
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,232
There can't be a place where
people are without food and ladies.

164
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,837
People gather where
there's food and girls!

165
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,107
- Where people gather, there's news.
- There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.

166
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,308
He's planning to sow his wild oats
under the guise of a special mission.

167
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,682
First off, finding a traveler's town with
lots of hot ladies is the top priority!

168
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,379
Every land should have a traveler's town.

169
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,653
Lodging

170
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:10,193
This is a traveler's town... right?

171
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:13,063
Looks like nobody's living here anymore.

172
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,900
No, I feel the presence of people...

173
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,309
And the smell of face powder!

174
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,980
- Naruto, take it out.
- Take what out?

175
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,616
Don't act as you don't know!

176
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:29,210
In anything one does,
a war chest is necessary, right?

177
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,723
What! Are you after my wallet? Man!

178
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:40,989
What?! This shouldn't be it!
Try jumping!

179
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:41,862
Huh?!

180
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,898
No! Stop!

181
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:53,267
One, two, three... Is this all you got?

182
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,710
That's all of it, really!

183
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,850
- Here...
- Huh?

184
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,180
It's not much, but please use it.

185
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,882
No! Sakura, there's no need for
you to give that to him!

186
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:08,452
But, it's money for
gathering information, right?

187
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,961
Right-right. This should be enough.

188
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:18,533
You guys go on ahead to the outskirts
of the post station and wait!

189
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,529
Wh Why?

190
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:24,233
It's too dangerous ahead from here.
It's a mission for adults.

191
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,904
Hmm, the smell of
face powder's from here.

192
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,407
Welcome...

193
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,512
A long came a sucker just begging
to be parted from his money.

194
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,280
We should be able to pulverize him.

195
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,794
Food and Drink! And young women!

196
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,261
Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,

197
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:30,240
he's just going to sow his oats without
gathering any information, anyway.

198
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,808
Sow his oats...?

199
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:35,342
Y Yeah...
I don't really know about it, but...

200
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,780
You know, make out blah blah blah...

201
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:41,182
It's fine!
If I can be of at least some help...

202
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,479
I'm always a hindrance
who can't do anything, so...

203
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,419
It's not like that!

204
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:50,155
In the first place,
if you hadn't taken the action...

205
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:54,657
I'd still be tied to the bed!

206
00:17:58,003 --> 00:17:59,834
Brothel

207
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,538
Even in different lands,
there are young women everywhere.

208
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,171
So? Why don't we move to
the room in the back?

209
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,807
I want to talk more relaxed.

210
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,908
Nice, nice.

211
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:16,317
Then first, settle up the tab
for here, okay?

212
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,149
What, am I already drunk
on this cheap drink...?

213
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,659
Aren't there like three too many zeros?

214
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:25,354
You like to joke, do you?

215
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,244
If you value your life,
leave all you've got on you here.

216
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,780
I see how it is.

217
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:54,621
Master Jiraiya's late.

218
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:57,757
I'm sick of waiting.

219
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,390
Naruto!

220
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,265
Who's there?!

221
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:27,625
Who're you?!
Are you one of Orochimaru's followers?!

222
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,157
<i>What? Was I wrong?!</i>

223
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:31,885
<i>Damn it.</i>

224
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,664
That kid had erased his presence
until he'd gotten that close.

225
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:39,092
I won't let him get away!

226
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,603
Don't move!

227
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:42,697
Wh Why?!

228
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:43,905
Makibishi Spikes!

229
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,010
Naruto!

230
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:51,182
Wh What?!

231
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:07,058
- Hold it! You jerk!
- We won't let you get away!

232
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:08,797
Naruto, what's that?!

233
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:12,336
Pervy Sage? What did you do?!

234
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,965
I'll tell you later!
Anyway, let's get out of here!

235
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,404
Why?!

236
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,942
Companions of the person just now?

237
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:22,172
If they're Orochimaru's followers,
with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I'II...

238
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:25,182
No, no! Don't get the wrong idea!

239
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:29,016
They're just bodyguards from a rip off bar!

240
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,851
R-Rip-off bar?!

241
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:36,192
First and foremost, this mission has
to be carried out in strict secrecy!

242
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:39,196
There'd be no point if you were
to use Ninja Art and stand out!

243
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,894
You! Carry the bags!

244
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:46,802
The one who's totally standing out
is you, Pervy Sage!

245
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,865
You have a point.

246
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:55,640
<i>This is wrong!</i>
<i>Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!</i>

247
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:28,573
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

248
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:34,950
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

249
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:45,521
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

250
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:55,297
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth</i>

251
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:02,036
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

252
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:11,346
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

253
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:23,059
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

254
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:33,502
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

255
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:46,255
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

256
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,362
Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.

257
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:55,333
Well, you guys wait here.

258
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,300
Huh? Why?!

259
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:58,359
Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!

260
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:00,871
It's too much for you youngsters.

261
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:01,802
Pervy Sage...

262
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:06,640
I myself should be the only sacrifice!
See ya, Naruto.

263
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:09,110
Blah -blah -blah, trying to look good...

264
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:12,742
Your scheme to go into
a weird shop again is totally obvious!

265
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:16,417
