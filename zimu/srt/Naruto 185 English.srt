1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:03,392
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:06,227
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,329
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:28,787
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:34,225
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:36,922
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,432
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,960
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:56,641
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,716 --> 00:01:02,086
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:07,491
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,654
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:19,468
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:33,206
Oh!

16
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:36,412
Sorry, sorry.

17
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,946
Was that some eagle poop
just now?

18
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,185
Nothing there, huh?

19
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,314
Well, I worked up a sweat,

20
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:47,689
so I guess I'll go home
and take a shower.

21
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:07,268
<i>A Legend from the Hidden Leaf.</i>
<i>The Onbaa!</i>

22
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:12,742
I worked up
a good sweat today too.

23
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,661
What's the deal, Akamaru?

24
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:31,627
He says you smell bad, Naruto.

25
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,738
Are you making sure
to take a bath?

26
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,131
Don't be saying rude things!

27
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,335
No, you seriously stink.

28
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:39,506
Come to think of it...

29
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,103
The poop from the eagle
a moment ago might...

30
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,379
Sakura.

31
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,178
Oh, I found a slacker
who can't get a mission!

32
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,514
That's just...
I'm not that much a slacker!

33
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,850
So it seems. You must've done
some reckless training.

34
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:55,022
It's ripped.

35
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:58,859
Huh? You're right. I didn't notice!

36
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,395
It can't be helped.

37
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,401
Bring it to me later.
I'll sew it up for you.

38
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,767
Really?! Really?! Really?!

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,804
Sakura, you're such a nice person.

40
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,114
It's the first time in my life...
you've been this nice to me!

41
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,909
H-Hey, Naruto. You're eaggerating.

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,912
Naruto!

43
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,621
Wh What're you doing, Sakura?!

44
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,926
You touched my breast
just now, didn't you?!

45
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,233
I didn't do anything like that!

46
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:43,839
Then, what're those hairy hands
sticking out from your armpit?!

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,845
What's... that?

48
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:50,309
Huh? Huh?!

49
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,278
Wh What's this?!

50
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:54,681
Your back.

51
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:55,612
Huh?

52
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,357
Wh What in the world is this?!

53
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,958
It's a huge poop!

54
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,864
Idiot! That's some kind of creature!

55
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:09,392
Is it a caterpillar?!

56
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,266
What?! Get it off.

57
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,998
No, this is an animal.

58
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,099
Let go!

59
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,145
Give me a break.

60
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:38,529
You guys, have you ever heard
of the legend of Onbaa?

61
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:39,954
Onbaa?

62
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,930
I've never heard of it!

63
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,933
Shizune! You don't know?

64
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:50,108
Nope. Is that legend something like
an old tale or something?

65
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:52,811
That's what I thought, but...

66
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:58,974
Long ago when I was young,
I heard about a legend...

67
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,177
A legend about a dangerous,
hairy, bear like creature called Onbaa

68
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:05,088
who lived deep in the mountains
near the village...

69
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,556
One day, that idiot Jiraiya
eagerly went into the forest

70
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,620
saying he was going to investigate
the Onbaa

71
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,722
for his summer vacation
independent research.

72
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,432
The Pervy Sage?

73
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:16,793
Yes...

74
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,332
<i>Are you an idiot?</i>

75
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,475
<i>Do you seriously think</i>
<i>there's an Onbaa?</i>

76
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,473
<i>Well, you'll get yours when</i>
<i>you see my independent research!</i>

77
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:29,612
<i>Who would?</i>

78
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:33,217
<i>Even if there were an Onbaa,</i>
<i>it wouldn't deal with you...</i>

79
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,984
<i>You said it! Flat chested girl!</i>

80
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,545
<i>Who's flat chested?!</i>

81
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,791
<i>No way is there such a thing</i>
<i>as an Onbaa!</i>

82
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,053
<i>You wanna bet on that?</i>

83
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,821
<i>Yeah! I'll bet!</i>

84
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,360
<i>Then, I'll bet on Jiraiya.</i>

85
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:46,489
<i>Huh?!</i>

86
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,798
<i>Then, I'm off to wrestle</i>
<i>with an Onbaa!</i>

87
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:57,675
And? Did the Pervy Sage
meet an Onbaa?

88
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,540
When he came back three days later,

89
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,340
he said he won with
a force out move...

90
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:03,840
which most likely was a lie.

91
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:10,914
Oh! Here it is.

92
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,053
Huh? What's this?

93
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,123
What lousy writing!

94
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,367
You're one to talk, Naruto.

95
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:27,238
Let's see... The Onbaa is big.
It is nine feet tall.

96
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,835
The Onbaa is scary.

97
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,804
No one is a match for it
when it gets mad.

98
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,807
But I beat it at wrestling.

99
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:35,739
What's this?

100
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,317
The Onbaa's child likes
being carried piggyback.

101
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,142
They grow up on the parent's back.

102
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,115
What?!

103
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,389
What Jiraiya wrote is bogus,
tracing the legend as is, but...

104
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,159
So there was an Onbaa...

105
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,624
Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,

106
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,666
it stays piggyback on my back
and won't get off.

107
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,466
What should I do?

108
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,300
According to legend,
the child Onbaa considers

109
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:04,609
the first thing it sees after birth
as its parent

110
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,105
and clings to the back
of that person.

111
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,838
It seems they grow that way,
piggybacked on the parent,

112
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:10,940
until they become an adult.

113
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:15,015
It seems until then,
they never leave the parent's back.

114
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:19,187
Then, there's no other way
but to wait until it grows up.

115
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,352
You say that, but when it grows up...

116
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,328
it'll turn into a scary
nine foot tall monster, right?

117
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,396
What's up with
that straightforward reaction?

118
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:35,204
Well, it's a legend,
so it'll probably get off eventually...

119
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,538
Don't be so irresponsible!

120
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,408
H-Hang in there, Naruto...

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,911
We'll be cheering you on
from behind the scenes.

122
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,484
Come up close rather than
behind the scene, damn it!

123
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,221
What is it?

124
00:08:58,598 --> 00:08:59,530
I won't lose, you know!

125
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,599
This isn't a weight, man!

126
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,912
What is it, Hinata?

127
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,656
Naruto... I heard a strange rumor.

128
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:30,858
A strange rumor... you say?

129
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:35,294
That you... umm... had a child.

130
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,794
Oh. You mean this?

131
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,172
Huh?! Hinata!

132
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,909
Hey! You okay?! Hinata!

133
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,710
Hinata, Hinata!

134
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,679
Hinata?!

135
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,469
What's the deal?
You're sure an extravagant guy...

136
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:20,968
Oh!

137
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:33,253
Am I going to have to take a bath
every time he pees on me?

138
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,660
Ichiraku Ramen

139
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,896
You know, we don't allow pets.

140
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,331
The Leaf Village public health
department is strict, you see.

141
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,971
I missed dinner because of him.

142
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,603
Overlook it just for today.

143
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,072
But now that I look closer,
he's cute, isn't he?

144
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:57,975
So, what's his name?

145
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:04,051
He's saying it himself,
so I guess Onbu is okay.

146
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:05,791
Onbu, huh...?

147
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,935
Doesn't he want to eat
some Naruto fish cake?

148
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:25,367
Here.

149
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,715
Old man!
Give me a whole roll of Naruto!

150
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:32,743
Coming right up!

151
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:07,012
Ever since you clung to my back,

152
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:09,145
I've been getting nothing
but odd jobs like this.

153
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,419
Well, I guess it can't be helped...

154
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,689
<i>He's gotten big...! And so quickly...</i>

155
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:22,996
<i>This is bad!</i>

156
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:38,441
Naruto Uzumaki,
you are assigned a mission

157
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:41,543
for the removal of the mountain bandits
from Yamabuki Pass!

158
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,119
Removal? Hey old lady...

159
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,914
Onbu's gotten big,

160
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,686
so you intend to get rid
of the troublemaker, right?

161
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,455
N -No, it's not like that.

162
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:54,660
I was thinking you've had
some eye opening growth recently, so.

163
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,830
Then, what about the other members?

164
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:57,926
No...

165
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,338
Since you've shown
such remarkable growth,

166
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,931
a solo infiltration should be fine.

167
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,309
Sure enough,
it's getting rid of the troublemaker!

168
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,423
This is also fate...
Okay now, back to work.

169
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:36,897
Thanks, mister!

170
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,879
N -Naruto, Naruto.

171
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:54,617
Things are fun when
you're around, Onbu!

172
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,296
That Grandma Tsunade.

173
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:02,758
Don't think you were able to
get rid of the troublemaker so easily.

174
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,035
I'll beat the mountain bandits
and finish up this mission lickety split

175
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:09,402
and the two of us will return
to the Leaf Village with pride!

176
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,530
Right, Onbu?!

177
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:21,382
Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!

178
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,055
Who're you, creep?!

179
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,320
Who're you?!

180
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:28,491
What do you want?!

181
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,526
I'm Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!

182
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:32,794
Prepare yourselves!

183
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,026
- Say what?!
- Get him!

184
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:38,364
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

185
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,972
Onbu!

186
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,078
Even knowing it's a clone...

187
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,077
I won't forgive those who hurt Onbu!

188
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:06,996
Heh! How was that?!

189
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,962
Die!

190
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,030
Onbu! You saved me!

191
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:23,047
Onbu... I owe you my life.

192
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,816
Let's get back to the village quick
and surprise everyone!

193
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:40,194
Onbu! No way will I believe that
you're a dangerous creature!

194
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:45,600
We'll go as the Onbu Naruto team
succeeding the Kiba Akamaru team!

195
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:52,773
What was that?

196
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,811
It's okay...

197
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,013
You've got me with you.

198
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,092
Onbu?! No, it's huge!

199
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,474
Could it be... you're after Onbu?

200
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,271
Are you Onbu's mom?!

201
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:30,212
W W W Wait! I didn't steal him!

202
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:32,977
Onbu! Say something, will you?!

203
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:37,780
Y You idiot, Onbu!

204
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,590
No, y - you've got the wrong idea!

205
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,093
Onbu, it's your mom.

206
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,291
It's not my intention!

207
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,831
Damn it! I had a rough time of it.

208
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,262
<i>If you're a mother,</i>

209
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,359
<i>then take better care</i>
<i>of your child, really!</i>

210
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:30,941
It's okay! I'll return Onbu to you!
So rest easy.

211
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:32,737
Huh? My body got light.

212
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:45,155
Huh? Onbu? You got so big!

213
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,054
Huh, wha?
What's the matter, Onbu?!

214
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,366
What's the deal?!

215
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:20,252
W W W Wait... Onbu, it's me!
Can't you tell?!

216
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,854
We were getting along
so well just a moment ago!

217
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,030
Please remember me!

218
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,099
It's me! Naruto U zu ma ki!

219
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:31,791
Oh, yeah! Naruto!

220
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,136
Naruto! Naruto!

221
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:35,662
Onbu, look at this!

222
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:40,270
Remember!
Remember this spiral!

223
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,678
Naruto, Naruto!

224
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:53,489
You remember my back you clung to
the whole time, don't you?

225
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,231
Have I... had it?

226
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:21,644
Onbu...

227
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,883
I'm tired...

228
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,668
This feels kind of good...

229
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,832
It's like I'm being carried piggyback.

230
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:49,778
Onbu...

231
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:11,732
Onbu!

232
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,032
Live in good health with your mom.

233
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:23,711
All right!

234
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:31,720
My sides... are splitting!

235
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,727
Onbaa is now no longer a legend.

236
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:41,157
They're thriving in the village forest
and seriously proliferating.

237
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,958
The stupid eagles carried them in, so.

238
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:50,671
Naruto! How'd you tear it off you?!
Tell me!

239
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:54,968
Who knows?
All I did was wrestle with Onbu.

240
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,709
Don't be so mean!

241
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:58,946
At this rate,
the village will be crushed.

242
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,120
Tell me! Naruto!

243
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,027
Don't look at me.

244
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,713
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

245
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,385
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

246
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:51,993
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

247
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:58,873
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

248
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:03,972
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

249
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:10,954
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

250
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:17,860
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

251
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:24,630
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

252
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:31,404
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

253
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:38,081
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

254
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:45,115
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

255
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,356
Shino and I have been
sent to a certain village to deal with

256
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,661
a dispute over a family head
who passed away.

257
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,593
An old woman suddenly appears
on the road and says this to us.

258
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,897
"Even dead men laugh
in Motoyoshi Village."

259
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:05,136
They were mysterious words.
I never imagined it at this time.

260
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:08,069
To think I would see with
my own eyes,

261
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,512
a sight in this villagertoo frightening
to even talk about...

262
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,572
Next: "Laughing Shino"

263
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,885
I can't even go to the bathroom
alone at night.
