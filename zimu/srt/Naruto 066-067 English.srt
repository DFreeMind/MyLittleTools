You have made us to wait for cos ì  a lot, and that sense
it has that spectacular entrance cos  ì!

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,620
Not to try to make feint of nothing,
six dannatamente in delay!

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,550
Diglielo, Naruto.

28
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,790
Left that glielo it says once for all, ok?

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,480
Sakura indeed was preoccupied for you!

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Sasuke!

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,030
Me it does not seem preoccupied more than a lot,
indeed he seems happy now.

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,830
Sasuke, has been the more spectacular entrance! Che figata!

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,010
I thought pits scappato perche '
you had fear to fight against of me.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,480
It seems that it is putting to you to cry.

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,610
not… but that you say…

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,470

I feel myself raised....

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,250
Welcome, Sasuke.

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,770
Naruto, the six type of person who will not never be able
to be the protagonist of one history.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,050
You are zitto!!! That the special one of Naruto begins!

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,110
Name?

44
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,340
Uchiha Sasuke.

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,610
An important hour....
The wild force of Sasuke

46
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,330
Finally it has beginning....

47
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,280
The rules are the same ones of the preliminary matters.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,790
The crash will go ahead until when
one of you dies or it is withdrawn.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,750
If the superiority of one of the two
challengers are crushing,  will stop  the crash…

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,160
But  I  will be alone to take this decision.

51
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,100
The man who  recalled  one storm!!
The Taijutsu di Sasuke Sopracciglione Style!

52
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,260
Hey Gai…

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,970
Ehi, Lee, as you feel yourself?

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,720
kakashi…

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Master Kakashi!

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,440
Oh, excuse excuse.

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,750
You must have been in thought.

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,610
Me dispiace not to before have you of put to the current.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,700
( Now Sakura Will drive crazy.)

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
It does not have more importance....

61
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,420
( I do not succeed to see it from here…)

62
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,410
( Sasuke…)

63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,650
Master Kakashi

64
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,600
Was one spot on the neck of Sasuke, just?

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,060
That thing.>.

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,400
Not preoccupartene more.

67
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,050
( Spot? )

68
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,120
Just cos ì.

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,500
( One)

70
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,410
(Two)

71
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,600
(Three )

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,450
( Four )

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,750
( Five…)

74
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,550
( Six )

75
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,360
( Seven )

76
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,820
( Eight )

77
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,030
Eight members of the special square in this enormous stage.

78
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,960
Two platoons are not sufficient in order to cover this area.

79
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,720
Cos' will have in mind the Hokage?

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,010
Be', until when we do not know as muoverà the enemy…

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,570
e' obliged to distribute the members of the special square
around the more critical areas in this village.

82
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,340
It is in order to begin.

83
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,260
We cannot lower the guard, but we will have
lend attention also to this encounter.

84
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,200
Kakashi, now we will see to that type of
training you have it subordinate....

85
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,730
Inasmuch as they are your eternal one avails again.

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,820
You have said something?

87
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,340
Just typical E' of you this, Kakashi!

88
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,860
Perche' continuous to answer to me cos ì!

89
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,920
Challenging, to the center.

90
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,800
Begun!

91
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,850
( This must be the sand about which Kakashi spoke  )

92
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,570
It does not make me to drive crazy…

93
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,380
Mother…

94
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,010
( But about what she is speaking )

95
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,240
Before… prima… ti I have made to taste disgustoso blood…

96
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,710
Me dispiace

97
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,870
But… this time…

98
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,370
it will have a better sapore.

99
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,000
It has begun to speak now already.

100
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,880
It is not a good sign.

101
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,990
I have not never seen Gaara
to become cos ì before an encounter.

102
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,830
It will want to say that the adversary is strong…

103
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,270
It seems that it has been calmed.

104
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,670
You come.

105
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,880
Hey,

106
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,950
Memories cos' have said to you yesterday?

107
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,390
To the end it had said…

108
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,190
" I will kill  to You  once for all, boys  "

109
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,810
" You must only wait for  "

110
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,520
You memories?

111
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,640
But it has not made it.

112
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,590
And to say that it had also an optimal opportunity.

113
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,580
We were not its objective.

114
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,320
" Fatemi to feel…"

115
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,370
It does not take to us neanche in consideration.

116
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,760
The only boy who  can  excite it is…

117
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,160
Sasuke!

118
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,510
" I only fight for same me and love alone same me  "

119
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,970
"From when task that the others only exist
in order it makes to feel alive....."me

120
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,390
" For me the world is wonderful  "

121
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,640
( Naruto.>.)

122
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,010
We begin!

123
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,260
The sand shield has become one sand copy.

124
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,430
( fast E'…)

125
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
( one moves just like....)

126
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,460
( fast E' )

127
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,520
( It has the same natural speed of Lee  )

128
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,730
( Moreover )

129
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,940
( it turns to It round using… il my style
of combat body to body )

130
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,250
That one must be the sand armor, eh?

131
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,410
Facts under.

132
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,820
Ringrazio, member of the special square.

133
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,110
They have said that Hinata to me
it will be on condition that cares well.

134
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,800
Sure....

135
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,040
Mh? You know?

136
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,340
But that you say?

137
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,080
It makes part of the special square.

138
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,290
", it is not what we have met to the examination…"

139
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,690
What you want to say?

140
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,690
Here what meant…

141
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,770
Facts under.

142
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,010
If you do not want to come, then  I  will come.

143
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,040
Fast E'…

144
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,220
What is that it does not go?

145
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,540
E' all here what you know to make?

146
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,510
( incredible E'....)

147
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,030
I will tear  you  of back that armor.

148
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,270
( one is muovendo to the same speed
of Lee when it removes the weights…)

149
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,860
( its movements are equal to those of Lee…)

150
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,770
( and its speed is various from before. )

151
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,330
( Sasuke....)

152
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,770
( a Six undoubtedly incredible genius.)

153
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,880
( Me many years are intentional in order to acquire that speed…)

154
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,520
( and.... and you have it acquired in a single month.)

155
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:15,520
( But it seems that consumptions a bag
of stamina in order to maintain that speed )

156
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,620
( What you are planning, Gaara? )

157
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,370
( the sand armor consumes too much chakra. )

158
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,120
( it will still not last to along. )

159
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,500
To that type of training you have it subordinate?

160
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,610
Com' can become cos ì  in a single month?

161
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,420
Sasuke has copied the style
body to body of Lee with the Sharingan.

162
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,180
Ecco perche' during the training
of the combat body to body....

163
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,160
I have made in Sasuke way focused all movements of Lee.

164
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,170
Sasuke knew Lee…

165
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,590
Ecco perche' has been in a position to acquiring of the movements.

166
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,740
Useless to dirsi, we have met a bag of difficulty.

167
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,480
( But…)

168
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,790
( Only with that one… solo with the combat body to body
it will not succeed to defeat the ninja of the sand. )

169
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,580
( Kakashi has observed the crash between
the abominable Gaara and the adorabile Lee. )

170
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,860
( Someone that neanche Lee could defeat…)

171
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,710
(  he cannot  be struck simply acquiring
one style body to body. )

172
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,660
( It would have to know it.)

173
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,180
( But then…)

174
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,670
( Perche' has made it to acquire only that style? )

175
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,130
" Perche' I exist and alive? "

176
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,820
" I have need to try it finche alive  "

177
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,140
" Or it would be like being died. "

178
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,100
" But about what it is speaking? "

179
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,760
" This is the conclusion to which they have arrived…"

180
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,660
" I exist in order to kill all the others except me."

181
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,050
" To the end I have found comfort in the fear of
to be able to be assassinated in every moment  "

182
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,920
Shikamaru…

183
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,580
We go from master Kakashi.

184
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,380
What you have intention to make?

185
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,680
Hey!

186
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,800
Fargli to interrupt the encounter.

187
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,580
( But Gaara…)

188
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,810
( it will not want to use that technique? )

189
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,620
( its sand is using all in order to defend itself)

190
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,900
( I did not think could vary the density of
sand until rendering it cos ì  hard)

191
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,730
This dev' to be what
the others call "defended absolute ".

192
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,440
All the sand has envelopped its body.>.

193
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,790
( It will be difficult to pull down )

194
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,560
( That it will make Sasuke, now? )

195
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,290
Master Kakashi!

196
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,300
Naruto!

197
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,250
That there is?

198
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,240
Master, it I pray firm this endured encounter!!

199
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,060
He…

200
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,020
Totally various E' from we.

201
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,490
It is not normal!

202
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,460
Naruto!

203
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,170
But about what you are speaking?

204
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,500
It only lives for being able
to kill persons. In any case…

205
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,680
To this point, Sasuke is in order to be killed!

206
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,130
( Not there is more no doubt. E' just that technique. )

207
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,820
( This is not a good)

208
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,780
( Gaara has lost completely sight the plan…!)

209
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,720
( Eternal damnation…!)

210
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,650
Master Kakashi!

211
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,710
Master, it I pray firm this endured encounter!

212
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,150
What?

213
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,310
Not to worry to you.

214
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,940
We are arrives in delay for one reason to you.

215
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,290
I was not for nothing in delay!
Definitive Movement - Chidori!!

216
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,610
( the third eye. )

217
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,430
( Not there is more no doubt. E' just that technique. )

218
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,650
Gaara....

219
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,770
( Nothing to make )

220
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,540
( completely it has been closed in if same…)

221
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,500
( I do not know what you are escogitando, but....)

222
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,200
( But this is the moment that I waited for. )

223
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,770
( For this movement I have need of time )

224
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,470
Hey, something does not go?

225
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,730
Not

226
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,170
It must have been my imagination.

227
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,710
Sbrighiamoci.

228
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
Master.

229
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,730
What you wanted to say with "we have come
in delay for a reason "?

230
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,200
You want to know it?

231
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,040
We do not have time for this!

232
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,610
Zitto and watches!

233
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,070
You you will make under.

234
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,080
( All this is absurd!)

235
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,600
( That Gaara… we do not know when we will receive marks them! )

236
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,950
( .... between little I will make  it  pieces.)

237
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,800
( Then, it leaves it to exit…)

238
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,130
( But about that it speaks? )

239
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,520
( Of the deeper part, and than cos' other )

240
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,710
( it will come some outside beautiful po' a true one? )

241
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,330
( I will give  all  to Them you. )

242
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,740
( They are always Bravo child.)

243
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,450
( , we make it)

244
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,960
( Mother, I  will be  to watch )

245
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,070
( Eternal damnation…  cannot  be made nothing
now that it is in that state. )

246
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,880
It has intention to perhaps ruin the plan and all the rest?

247
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,700
Damned Gaara…

248
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,320
( Devil… Forse would have to scappare…)

249
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,080
( Slowly? )

250
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,450
How it proceeds?

251
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,060
All it goes the plans second.

252
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,420
Tried of sbrigarvi with the rituale of the evocation.

253
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,360
We would want to be in a position to
to move to us anytime.

254
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,260
I have understood!

255
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,720
Then, I leave all in hand yours here.

256
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,380
It will not be....

257
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,290
Supervisionato Ho the training of Sasuke…

258
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,890
just perche' it is similar to me.

259
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,470
Activation of the body....

260
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,590
I understand now…

261
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,030
this is the reason for which you have taught the technique to it of
combat body to body. In order to increase its speed!

262
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,260
Exact.

263
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,300
Amazing… riesco to see
clearly the chakra with my eyes!

264
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,570
But as it succeeds to us?

265
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,550
( That technique, will not be…)

266
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,900
( the force of the Uchiha clan Must be this )

267
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,880
Undoubtedly.

268
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,940
But cos' it is that one ?

269
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,550
It emits the strongest noise. Which race of movement is?

270
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,510
Simply a direct attack.

271
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,130
What?

272
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,120
But one is the better attack of the number
of the village of the leaf....

273
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,030
The only movement originates them of Kakashi the copy-ninja.

274
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:02,920
What?

275
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,470
E' one moved secret only used with fine homicides.

276
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,610
Its secret hides in the speed of the blow…

277
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,960
and in the activation of the body in order to generate
one great amount of chakra.

278
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,370
Therefore it concentrates all the chakra in the arm with which it attacks.

279
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,000
And because of the enormous speed to which one moves…

280
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,470
it emits a cinguettio similar to that one of hundred of birds

281
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,520
Ecco perche' that movement is called....

282
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,460
Chidori. (Flock of birds)

283
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,070
Dev' to be one joke…

284
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,110
The absolute defense of Gaara....

285
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,120
It cannot  be true....

286
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,440
P uò  not to be.....

287
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,790
Not bad.

288
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,290
That one is the movement of kakashi....

289
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,290
Chidori… chiamata also "cut of the lightning ".

290
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,800
"Cut of the lightning "?

291
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:54,530
That name was given to it when once Kakashi  cut
in two a lightning with that movement.

292
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,940
( it cut  a lightning? )

293
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,950
( What? )

294
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,660
( it knows Me of hauled....)

295
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,680
( incredible....)

296
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,790
Its true name is Chidori…

297
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,940
And its secret resides in the maximum speed that a body
human  can  catch up; The speed of the attack…

298
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,480
and the amount of accumulated Chakra in the arm.

299
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,860
Cos ì  the arm transforms in one sword
that  it can  cut any thing.

300
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,830
Sure that you have taught one to it moved much dangerous one.

301
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,340
You would not have to say them these things to me just,

302
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,770
True, Lee?

303
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,820
I just do not succeed to understand of logic…

304
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,780
But it is indeed one moved incredible!

305
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,310
( I understand instead.....)

306
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:51,090
( If pits be in he, I would not have thrown myself on the enemy
only after to have acquired speed.)

307
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,320
( Indeed, for being preciser, I cannot. )

308
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,460
( the direct attacks are easy expectable from the enemy.)

309
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,530
( and my eyes do not succeed
to find the attack and to counterattack. )

310
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,180
( I envy to You, Sasuke. )

311
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,920
( When we have fought, I have said to you that…)

312
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,690
" useless E' that your eyes succeed to follow to me, when
your body  cannot  answer to the same speed  "

313
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,970
( For a moment indeed they are felt me advanced. )

314
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,420
( But you six successful one to obtain
a high speed, just like me )

315
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,270
( and you....)

316
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,810
( oltretutto you have your Sharingan. )

317
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,550
Six mine.

318
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,320
Third company, ready to move.

319
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,840
We are ready finally.

320
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,370
All the prepared ones are complete to you.

321
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,710
Received.

322
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,590
We will pass to the action after marks them.

323
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,560
Arrived E' the moment.

324
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,950
( the boy who until to one
moment it makes was preoccupied for Sasuke....)

325
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,370
( Now it is geloso of he. )

326
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,220
Sasuke....

327
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,240
" E' this the feeling…"

328
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,090
" Technical of the evocation! "

329
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,980
( they have become stronger…)

330
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,660
( for being able to become Hokage, and I do not want
to lose against nobody.)

331
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,840
" sasuke! "

332
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,380
( Therefore  I will not lose  neanche with you. )

333
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,340
" I want to fight also against of you "

334
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,720
( But you…)

335
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,050
" I know It  "

336
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,950
What… cos' is this warm thing?

337
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,120
Mother… what…

338
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,630
Blood! My blood!

339
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,820
But like…

340
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,050
Gaara will not have been hurt?

341
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,550
But cos' it is that one?

342
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
E' "the its" arm!

343
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,940
This was not previewed…!

344
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,980
It will not have been transformed in its complete shape?

345
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,160
Of it I do not have idea.

346
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,110
It seems hurt… Never it has not happened before.

347
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,320
( Only the memory of that thing, gives the brividi to me....)

348
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,590
( they are not successful to eat for a beautiful one po '
after to have seen it for before the time. )

349
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,140
That thing seems just....

350
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,210
( Cos' is this feeling? )

351
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,500
Wounded E'!

352
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,040
The shield has been broken prematurely.

353
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,360
… quelli they were not the eyes that I have seen before.

354
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,780
( Cos' was those eyes, then? )

355
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,010
But what is happening?

356
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,950
