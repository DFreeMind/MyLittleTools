1
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:33,150
<i>Gaara.</i>

2
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:34,785
<i>Kankuro.</i>

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,887
<i>Gaara.</i>

4
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,045
Primary Lotus!

5
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:46,659
Damn it! Can't hold any further.

6
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:52,002
You can't even howl like a loser?

7
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:57,441
Die!

8
00:00:58,676 --> 00:00:59,904
You're mine!

9
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,303
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!

10
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:13,924
What?!

11
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,559
Who're you?!

12
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:31,803
Heh... It seems
you're an ally this time...

13
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,218
Who are you?!

14
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,843
A Sand...

15
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,323
...Shinobi...

16
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,486
...ally of the Leaf!

17
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:06,035
Well, be careful going home.

18
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,344
Okay.

19
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,507
If something happens again,
I'll come to your rescue again...

20
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,880
Just let me know, crybaby.

21
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:21,256
You always say too much.
That's why girls are...

22
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,758
I'll return the favor twice the amount
from that time.

23
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,681
Hey, Shikamaru.
What's the matter?

24
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,854
We'll stand by here for a while.

25
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:52,416
Stand by?

26
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:55,993
We don't have time fooling around
in a place like this!

27
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,951
Be quiet for a second, Naruto.

28
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:03,097
That's right.
Shikamaru's got a proper plan.

29
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:07,668
Right, right. Naruto, you have to
be sure to obey the leader.

30
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,233
Fine.

31
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,155
<i>Shino, I'm counting on you.</i>

32
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:43,004
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

33
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:02,758
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

34
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:08,629
<i>because we were always together</i>

35
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:14,730
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

36
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:20,335
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

37
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:27,017
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

38
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:33,991
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

39
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:46,630
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

40
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:53,039
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

41
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:58,242
<i>Our two hearts</i>

42
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,933
<i>Sand Alliance with the Leaf Shinobi</i>

43
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,634
So, Kujaku? What's going on
with our pursuers?

44
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,832
Yeah, we went to the trouble of
leaving footprints as we go.

45
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,242
We need them to follow.

46
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,911
It'll be okay. They'll be within
firing range immediately!

47
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,820
There are three pursuers.
One of them is Gaara!

48
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,122
As for the extra two, we'll leave one
for each respectively

49
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,992
and deal with them with
One Shinobi, One Kill...

50
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,725
I'll isolate Gaara and drive him into
the Reverse Scale Position.

51
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,469
I'll take the first person.

52
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:54,368
All right, go.

53
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,082
It's not necessary to drive him
into the Reverse Scale Position.

54
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:15,449
There are only three of them.
I can handle them by myself.

55
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,823
Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword:

56
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:22,421
Whirlwind!

57
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,671
What?!

58
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,773
What is this?

59
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:31,566
A wind user, huh?

60
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:34,311
Interesting!

61
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:54,925
- Splendid.
- Not bad, Temari.

62
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,091
Naturally.

63
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,396
Not half bad.

64
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,777
To think you'd blow away my Whirlwind.

65
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,611
What, you're still just a kid?

66
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,351
- You guys go on ahead.
- What?

67
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,683
Hey, Temari. You okay with this?

68
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:21,191
Will you be okay?

69
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:24,189
Well, we're fellow wind users.

70
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,990
I should be able to handle her alone.

71
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,823
Hurry, Gaara.

72
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,627
She's your student, right?

73
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,104
Thanks.

74
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,269
- I'm counting on you.
- Be careful.

75
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:37,574
Right.

76
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:38,776
You won't get away.

77
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,967
I'm your opponent.

78
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,440
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu.

79
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:49,920
Wind Slash.

80
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,395
This wind is...

81
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:03,463
These double swords alter the wind
at my will to suit the attacks

82
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,627
and amplify the power to the extreme.

83
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,164
It's too late to regret.

84
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,233
I only need a little bit of Chakra
as long as I have these swords.

85
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:14,869
How long can you pesevere with
the limited Chakra you have?

86
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,208
How about testing that out?

87
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,987
<i>Matsuri.</i>

88
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:28,150
We caught up.

89
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,860
Where are we?

90
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:32,396
So you're awake?

91
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,532
Heh. You're like prey plunged on
a branch by a shrike.

92
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,695
You're the bait to lure him out.

93
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:40,971
What?

94
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:44,932
Gaara Sensei.

95
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,710
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.

96
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,555
What?

97
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:07,664
Darn it.

98
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:21,337
Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

99
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:23,671
You're just a kid!

100
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,209
<i>I see.</i>

101
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:31,213
<i>It's an adjustable sword with daggers</i>

102
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:33,450
<i>connected by an iron wire</i>
<i>going through the center.</i>

103
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,622
<i>Like a Bamboo Snake?</i>
<i>How nostalgic.</i>

104
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,065
<i>I used one a lot with puppet games</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

105
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,429
It can look like a living snake
depending on how it's controlled.

106
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,337
But there's no point
once it's been identified.

107
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:55,008
Though we both use Puppets,
compared to mine, it's just a kid's toy.

108
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:56,613
Go, Gaara.

109
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,939
Can I leave it to you?

110
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:02,117
Yeah. I don't need your help for this.
I'll catch up right away.

111
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm counting on you.

112
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:07,090
Now, bring it on. I'll play with you.

113
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,425
What're you doing acting tough?

114
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:12,261
You'll die if you take me lightly!

115
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,661
That goes for you!

116
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,061
Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!

117
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:20,938
Here I go.

118
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:40,415
That's no good.

119
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,783
Come on, that was too easy.

120
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:57,167
Too bad. This sword
isn't just an adjustable sword.

121
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:01,673
The sword itself amplifies Chakra
in response to my Chakra

122
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,941
and changes into the form of a dragon.

123
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:08,780
Gaara, I'm sorry.
This might take a little time.

124
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,191
Suiko, you ambush him here.

125
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:17,159
Draw him into
the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?

126
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,328
Yeah...

127
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,106
You won't get through here.

128
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,943
Gaara, fight me.

129
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:38,849
Very well.

130
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:40,484
Bring it.

131
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,263
Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we
going to stay like this?

132
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:05,502
Shut up. There are many difficulties
with ambushes.

133
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,911
Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata
are taking on those difficulties for us.

134
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:12,777
What? They are?

135
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:24,094
Did you find them?

136
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,529
Byakugan!

137
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,003
In that direction, right?

138
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:40,710
Byakugan!

139
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:57,425
Got it. There are three battle areas.

140
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,974
<i>It's the scent bag of</i>
<i>the female Parasitic Insects.</i>

141
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:16,171
<i>With this, the insects will find you</i>
<i>no matter where you go.</i>

142
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,674
<i>Right. I'm counting on you, Shino.</i>

143
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,874
<i>Then, we'll be going on ahead.</i>

144
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,519
<i>Be careful!</i>

145
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,047
Oh, information has arrived.

146
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:28,249
I was getting sick of waiting!

147
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,259
All right, I'm counting on you guys.

148
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,268
This is bad.
It's already begun.

149
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,497
All right, Kiba and Choji,
you take the western forest.

150
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,639
Ino and I will take the northeastern hills.

151
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:48,140
Naruto and Lee, you take
the northwestern forest.

152
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,042
We'll take on back up
in two man cells.

153
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,117
Now then, let's begin
the favor-returning operation.

154
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,187
- Right.
- Right.

155
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,615
I was waiting for this time!

156
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:01,858
Scatter.

157
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:15,672
What is it?

158
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:16,940
Hold up.

159
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:24,075
<i>If the guys who are fleeing will take on</i>
<i>pursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill,</i>

160
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,977
<i>the battle area not being</i>
<i>a straight line means...</i>

161
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,915
Could it be a Barrier?

162
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:31,288
What?

163
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,489
Just to be safe.

164
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,899
That should do it. Let's go.

165
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:49,239
Right.

166
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:11,925
Now, there's nowhere left to hide.
What will you do?

167
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,387
<i>To think she'd evade all of my attacks.</i>

168
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,591
<i>Since it's come to this, I've just got to</i>
<i>use that technique!</i>

169
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,505
Wind Style: Sea Dragon!

170
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,380
What's that? Nothing's happening.

171
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:37,587
How pitiful. It seems the wind
doesn't like you.

172
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,715
I don't know about that.

173
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,556
The wind is my friend.

174
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:08,978
This battle is just starting.

175
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,479
Wind Reversal!

176
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:26,002
Die!

177
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,906
Darn it! Hey, let go!

178
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:37,711
Done already? I thought
we could play a little more...

179
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:46,289
That's the spirit!

180
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,489
What kind of toy is it this time?

181
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:14,378
That's funny. You think you can
defeat me with junk like this?

182
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,586
The junk is your sword.

183
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:42,075
What?! A three headed dragon!

184
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:45,014
You're just quick to escape, eh?

185
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:48,846
<i>Darn it.</i>

186
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,520
<i>Sure enough,</i>
<i>Crow is at a disadvantage</i>

187
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:53,055
<i>unless teamed up with Black Ant.</i>

188
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,643
Not bad, Gaara of the desert.

189
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,314
How much Chakra is built up
in that sand?

190
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,483
You want to test that out?

191
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,288
However...

192
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:27,982
It'll be in exchange for your life.

193
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,298
Sand Coffin!

194
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,184
Impossible.

195
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,444
That's a nice sand bath.

196
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,490
You, the sand's Chakra...

197
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:06,123
Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra.

198
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,839
Aw, is this good night?

199
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,703
Just sleep as is! For all eternity!!

200
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,250
What?!

201
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,363
That was a close shave,

202
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,365
but Shadow Possession Jutsu
was a success!

203
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,199
Die already!

204
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:52,475
Uh, oh!

205
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:55,945
What?

206
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,763
You guys.

207
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,523
Who are you?

208
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,534
Who are you guys?

209
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,234
- An ally of the Sand.
- An ally of the Sand.

210
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,596
- Leaf Shinobi.
- Leaf Shinobi

211
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,330
Believe it!

212
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,175
He's not here!

213
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,074
- They're further ahead.
- Right!

214
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,273
<i>Guys, fight as much as you want.</i>

215
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:36,079
<i>I don't see any Chakra abnormalities</i>
<i>in the basin...</i>

216
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:37,554
<i>There's no Barrier.</i>

217
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,980
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

218
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,451
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

219
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:59,267
<i>Gaara Sensei.</i>

220
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,654
Just wait, Gaara!

221
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:14,552
We'll return the favor, no matter what.

222
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:23,430
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

223
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,769
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

224
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:39,579
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

225
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,178
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

226
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:49,123
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

227
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:53,993
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

228
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,967
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

229
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:03,200
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

230
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:07,676
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

231
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:15,082
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

232
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:18,986
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

233
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:24,255
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

234
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:28,388
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

235
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:33,266
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

237
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:44,105
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

238
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:55,119
Damn it.
This was their aim from the start.

239
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,593
To think they would take advantage
of the terrain.

240
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,556
Damn. At this rate,
Gaara will be in danger.

241
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,101
That's been said,
we can't move from here.

242
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:08,137
Please hurry, Naruto, Lee.

243
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:11,403
You two are the only ones
who can help Gaara now.

244
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,943

"Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!
