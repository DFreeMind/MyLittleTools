2
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,815
Hyuga Hinata vs Hyuga Neji

3
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:38,184
Give up now. It's not your destiny to be a ninja.

4
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,711
Don't decide what the other person
is, dumbass! Beat this guy up, Hinata!

5
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,682
Hinata! Say something back to him! He's getting ME agitated!

6
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:06,988
Naruto-kun... Thank you!

7
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,267
Her eyes changed...

8
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:15,085
So, you won't forfeit... then I'm not
responsible for what'll happen to you!

9
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:17,593
I don't want to run away!

10
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,834
Byakugan!

11
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,323
Brother Neji... Let's fight!

12
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:42,990
HERE!

13
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,311
In front of the person she admires!

14
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,061
She's only at this level, just as I thought...

15
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,012
The power of the Souke(the main family).

16
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:39,524
What's going on?! Hinata's attack was perfectly landed, too!

17
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,246
Not yet!

18
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:58,724
What a guy!

19
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:02,301
It can't be...

20
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:09,511
Oh... He's indeed at the level to be called
the most genius in the Hyuga clan's history.

21
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,362
No, it can't be...

22
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:32,194
You were.. from the beginning...

23
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:36,078
That's right. My eyes are able to see Tenketsu(chakura points).

24
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,086
What is he talking about?

25
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:44,525
There are 361 points on the Keirakukei(chakura highway).

26
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:46,924
They're just about size of a needle point.

27
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:49,363
They're called chakura points.

28
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:55,339
Theoretically, if you hit these points
exactly, you can stop the opponent's chakura flow,

29
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:57,336
or increase the flow.

30
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,096
You can control it as you wish.

31
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,349
I'll tell you one more thing, since
I'm already explaining to you.

32
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,021
I'd have to say that even my
Sharingan can't see the chakura points.

33
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:16,533
Even though he can use his eyes to see in, I can't
believe he can spot their exact position during a battle.

34
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:29,826
Hinata-sama..

35
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,698
This is the difference that can't be changed.

36
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,762
The difference between losers and elites..

37
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:41,198
This is the reality that can't be changed.

38
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:47,160
At the time you said you don't want to run, your fate was set.

39
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,998
Now you're despairing.

40
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,800
This is the final warning.

41
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,229
Forfeit this battle!

42
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,718
I...

43
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,182
...don't...

44
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,790
...bend...

45
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,310
...my

46
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:25,661
words.

47
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,205
I won't run away!

48
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,931
This is also my Nindo(way of Ninja).

49
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,916
I didn't know Hinata was this amazing...

50
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,476
She is just like you.

51
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:09,523
Right... now I think of it, she's been always watching you.

52
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:24,668
Come on!

53
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:39,845
She's at her limit. If she takes any more of those attacks..

54
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:55,923
Neji's attacks to her chakura points have
stopped Hinata's chakura flow completely.

55
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:02,683
In other words, she can't do Juken attacks
that thrust chakura into opponent's body.

56
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,104
This battle is over.

57
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:16,315
But well.. I never imagined there was a guy like this. I have
to say that even Sasuke in my team won't be a good match for him.

58
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:22,790
I'd have to say that Neji will win this. It's
impossible for that girl's level to beat him.

59
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:39,159
What eyes... Hinata won't be killed, will she?

60
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:47,824
It's like.. his strength seems
to be unfair. Too strong.. Really

61
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,123
Hinata! Go for it!

62
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,445
Again, I can see her strength come back to her eyes

63
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,814
I've always been watching,

64
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:15,818
for so many years, I've been watching you

65
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,550
I wonder why...

66
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:28,393
Next, Uzumaki Naruto!

67
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,016
Dammit.. tiring

68
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,288
It's all your fault

69
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:34,656
Not mine...

70
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:38,601
Let's do it..

71
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,169
Naruto-kun... do your best.

72
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:44,823
Transform!

73
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:49,774
I don't know why, but...

74
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:07,046
My Name is Uzumaki Naruto! I won't lose to you all! Got it?

75
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,043
"I won't lose to you all"? Man...

76
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,420
How stupid. He makes everybody here his enemy in one second.

77
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:28,980
Looking at Naruto...

78
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,506
Stand Up! Naruto!

79
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:48,445
If you fight over the Hokage’s name, you'll be a looser!

80
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:53,023
I feel courage grow in me.

81
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,945
I start to feel like even I can
do it If I put my efforts into it.

82
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,901
I can start believing that even I am worth to something.

83
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,422
Hinata...

84
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,062
Who always falls into a habit of giving up, but you
started to try changing yourself along the way...

85
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:34,392
Hey Hinata. Let's go home now!

86
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:40,646
I know the most, that you've been training so hard.

87
00:11:54,468 --> 00:12:01,058
but you always fail in missions. You were weak at
the time it counted the most, and easily depressed.

88
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,171
But... Today's Hinata is different.

89
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:12,290
I've never seen her eyes like that before.

90
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:19,140
Naruto-kun. Until now, I could only watch...

91
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,964
but now, I finally.. finally I...

92
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,784
You're a blockhead. Your attacks weren't
giving me any damages from the beginning.

93
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,757
It's over.

94
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,710
Hinata, that's enough. You may have lost
this battle, but you are different now.

95
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,982
You did great.

96
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:42,088
I want to change myself... that's why I voluntarily...

97
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:51,465
That was the Neji's final blow that attacked the heart.
I feel sorry, but she won't be able to stand up anymore.

98
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,264
I decide that this battle can't be no longer fought.

99
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:12,367
Don’t stop it!

100
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,273
I said, Don't stop it!

101
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:24,066
Hey, what're you saying Naruto! Stupid.
It's her limit. She's unconscious now...

102
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,996
Why do you stand up again?

103
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,881
If you overwork yourself, you're really going to die.

104
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:20,946
In front of the person whom I
admire...who finally starts to look at me.

105
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,892
Why?

106
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,350
I can't show him me like this...

107
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,146
Not yet!

108
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,761
Don't bluff. You can barely stand
up. I can see that with my eyes.

109
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,992
You were burdened the fate to be Hyuga clan's heir.

110
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:58,880
You've been blaming yourself for being weak.

111
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:08,422
But a person cannot change. It’s your fate.
There’s no need to struggle anymore. Give it up.

112
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,271
That's not true, Brother Neji.

113
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,041
Because I can see it.

114
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:23,395
Even more than I do, you're struggling.

115
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:25,026
What?

116
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:32,382
In the fate of Souke(the main family) and Bunke(the
branch of mainfamily), it's you who have been struggling.

117
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:40,719
Neji-kun. This match is already ended.

118
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:43,076
...not good.

119
00:16:54,928 --> 00:17:00,351
Neji, stop it already. You promised me that
you won't get carried away about Souke things.

120
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:06,000
Why do other Jounins always come to
stop me? The Souke get special attention?

121
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,538
Hinata. Are you alright? Hey!

122
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:28,770
I ..

123
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:37,721
Was I ..

124
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,228
Was I able to change myself a little bit?

125
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,831
Hey, looser...

126
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,487
I'll warn you about two things.

127
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,743
If you are a real ninja, stop the
meaningless cheers for the others.

128
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,963
and one more... a looser is always looser. It'll never change!

129
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,881
You wanna try?

130
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:25,735
You..

131
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:32,687
I can understand your feeling very well.
But the battle should be fought in a match.

132
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:41,256
A looser will beat an elite with his efforts.
It's going to be fun in the real final exams.

133
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:45,222
It may be I who will fight against him.

134
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,391
There's no hard feelings, if you are the one to fight him.

135
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,889
Alright.

136
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:03,347
Wasn't that good? Guy sensei!

137
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,356
Lee! What a guy you are! Nice!

138
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,762
Not good. Her heartbeat is getting weaker.

139
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,556
Was he intending to kill her?

140
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:35,236
If you have time to stare at me, you'd
better use that time to look at her.

141
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,503
Medical Team! What're you doing! Quick!

142
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:39,632
Sorry!

143
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,644
Move her onto the strecher. Now..

144
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,371
She won't last 10 min. We need to move
her to the emergency room. Hurry up!

145
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:33,507
That's also my Nindo(way of Ninja).

146
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:42,912
I promise you that ...

147
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,335
I will win!

148
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:39,856
Perfect defense using sand?

149
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,863
No one ever has injured him before.

150
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:47,807
He's very strong and has no faults.
Those thick-eyebrow won't ...

151
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,504
He's not being pushed! He's way faster than
before. Is this the result of that training?

152
00:22:56,162 --> 00:23:01,314
Next episode: Crash Gaara! It's Youth! It's Power! Explode!

153
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,454
But that training, I get a little envy.
