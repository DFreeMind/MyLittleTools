Ce I do not make it more.

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,164
Sakura-chan!

18
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:41,587
For how much we have walked?

19
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:45,081
The tower still does not seem to approach itself!

20
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,849
E' like if it remained of forehead to we

21
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,835
Strange E'

22
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:51,156
Obvious.

23
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,501
It seems that someone

24
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:56,182
 warm acceptance has prepared us one.

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,524
Watched l !

26
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,691
But that one is

27
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:08,908
What is happening?

28
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,406
It cannot  be!!

29
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,871
Genjutsu!
(illusory Art!)

30
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,996
It would seem.

31
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:16,405
We have fallen ourselves like of the polli.

32
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:19,618
Too much it engages to you to attend to the ambushes

33
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:23,338
 we have continued to turn
around to the same place.

34
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,611
They are observing.

35
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,247
Probably

36
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:32,025
They try to tire to us most possible
in order to attack when we are to the extreme.

37
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:35,026
Therefore we are making the game of the enemy.

38
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,784
Sure

39
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,366
They will attack to us soon.

40
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,540
Eccoli here.

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,229
A lot is being made interesting.

42
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:29,038
The Combat of the Cloni!
I am the protagonist!

43
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,463
Which thing is happening?

44
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,783
They are many.

45
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,448
And they are all Bushin (cloni)

46
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:45,812
Like a rat in trap.

47
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:51,331
We will see!!!

48
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:01,275
Oh, is more weak people of the previewed one.

49
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:04,612
Very made, Naruto!

50
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:25,031
Who who is in truth!

51
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,634
That he happens!

52
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,274
I will discover  their secret.

53
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,562
Sharingan!

54
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,466
Naruto!

55
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,668
Sasuke!

56
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:23,300
Sasuke-kun!

57
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,601
That it is happening!

58
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,819
My body!

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,410
You are well?

60
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,346
Without doubt they are real.

61
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:47,119
They are not illusions.

62
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,338
If Kabuto-saint it is remained hurt means

63
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:59,884
 that in truth they are Kage Bushin (Cloni d' Ombra)?

64
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:00,852
But

65
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:01,988
But

66
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,714
The Kage Bushin, when they endure
damages, would have to disappear.

67
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:08,439
But they not, are really of the illusions?

68
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,331
What diamine are!?

69
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,740
Eternal damnation!

70
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,000
Useless E'!

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,947
Stopped!

72
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,631
Illusions are alone

73
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,583
E' a Genjutsu of the enemy.

74
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:31,615
But.>.

75
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:35,165
The wound of Kabuto-saint is real.

76
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:38,646
Not, Sasuke-kun has reason.

77
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:42,017
The enemy is hidden sure from some part

78
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:47,025
He attacks to us sincronizzando
with the movements of the illusions.

79
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:53,014
Cos   makes us to believe that they are
the illusions to attack to us.

80
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:04,449
Then  I will find  the bastard
that nozzle the kunai secretly

81
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,915
And I will step on  it  to it must!

82
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:08,903
It waits for, Naruto-kun.

83
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:12,369
In this moment, the source
of the launch of the kunai it is indefinite,

84
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,990
We do not know the exact position of the enemy.

85
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,336
You understand?

86
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,559
This is their strategy.

87
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:26,552
According to my experience, who is inferior in the Taijutsu
(Fight body to body) attacks in this way.

88
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:32,617
The enemy will not reveal itself until when
we will not be more in a position to moving to us.

89
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,235
You listen to me well.

90
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,584
In order now

91
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,627
We can only schivare the attacks.

92
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,485
Then

93
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,445
If this is their plan

94
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:49,708
Interesting

95
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,848
 but how much will last!

96
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,831
The night is long.

97
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,923
It never does not end!!!

98
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,072
You take this!

99
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:22,050
Stopped, Naruto-kun.

100
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,144
Not to waste Chakra.

101
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:27,809
E' useless to attack them.

102
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,412
If free me of the illusions in one single time

103
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:34,770
The enemy will not be able to attack until when not
they will return to their normal state.

104
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,681
Otherwise it would reveal its position.

105
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,562
Kage Bunshin not Jutsu!
(Technical of the Clone d' Ombra)

106
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,284
Kage Bunshin?

107
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,986
I have not still ended!!!

108
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:12,326
Sasuke-kun, what we can make?

109
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,850
That idiot

110
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,365
We must fight also!

111
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:17,746
But

112
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:22,427
,  the situation  cannot control alone.

113
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:23,485
We go, Sakura!

114
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,427
Eh!

115
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:53,725
I have not still ended

116
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,996
The sky is schiarendo.

117
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,397
E' the moment to hunt.

118
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,496
Mubi, you can stop hour.

119
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,000
We have fiaccato their minds.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,525
Now

121
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,942
Their body lacks us.

122
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,134
That fortune

123
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:21,096
Tu!

124
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:25,354
You six which have hurt to me
to the left shoulder, true?

125
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:28,274
We meet ourselves finally.

126
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,913
You have wasted your time.

127
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,330
That fortune

128
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,405
 hour  I will be able  to be revenged.

129
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:48,054
You have wasted your time!

130
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,721
That fortune

131
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,052
Finally  I will be able  to be revenged.

132
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:06,234
Like a rat in trap.

133
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,865
Well succeeded E', Naruto.

134
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:25,001
What has made

135
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,020
It cannot  be

136
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,371
When they have!

137
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,686
Stupiden!

138
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:33,799
To the fine ones you have shown yourselves, cursed.

139
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:39,152
What!

140
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,359
Those boy has

141
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,818
It is not possible!

142
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:47,053
I have used the Kage Bunshin
in order to prepare the trucchetto.

143
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:52,321
They are successful to replace
all the elements of the square.

144
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:59,967
Not hardly Naruto has created our copies,
we three are hidden.

145
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:05,293
Cos   a master of Genjutsu has been tricked.

146
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,193
Naruto!

147
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:17,003
Naruto, you have consumed much Chakra.

148
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,149
I  will make I remain.

149
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:35,316
I will not allow that it takes to you
all the merits after this hard work.

150
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,531
E' truly "that" Naruto!

151
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,014
From when

152
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:54,374
 he has become cos   strong?

153
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:57,177
That boy

154
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,040
  he can himself  be still moved after all this.

155
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,933
Naruto

156
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:07,735
That incredible amount of Chakra.

157
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:17,404
Endured after the Kage Bunshin not Jutsu,
it has transformed three cloni in our copies.

158
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:21,652
After all this  it can  still move!

159
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:24,705
Moreover we are to the fifth day.

160
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:31,001
If it obtained the mastery
of its Chakra, it would become

161
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,120
 monstrous strongly.

162
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,437
Very made.

163
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:40,996
But we are not still defeats.

164
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,436
Not there is more time.

165
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:50,100
Now we will show you our Ninjutsu!
(Technical Ninja)

166
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:54,707
Ninpou: Oboro Bunshin not Jutsu!
(Ninja Art: Technique of the Clone di Nebbia)

167
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:00,322
The Kage Bunshin

168
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,880
Not, normal retorts are alone.

169
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,326
But they must have in mind some type of tactics.

170
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,302
It makes attention!

171
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:10,422
If they are only of the copies, solo one is real.

172
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:14,140
I will hit  them  all until sending
to the carpet that true one.

173
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,883
Idiot, is only one waste of energies.

174
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:18,100
You I have already said

175
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,177
 not intrometterti!

176
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,311
Naruto, is impossible!

177
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,642
Imprudent

178
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:40,650
When I try to use the Sharingan,
I feel one driven in to the neck.

179
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,053
What is using too much Chakra?

180
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,355
Eternal damnation

181
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,837
Accidents, copy was one.

182
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,951
Also this

183
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,993
Also this!

184
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,384
Also this!

185
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:56,139
Naruto-kun, stopped!

186
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,921
What is all is made?

187

Of new a Genjutsu?

188
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,479
This is

189
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,975
 those that me remains

190
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,482
 of my Chakra!

191
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:09,398
Sharingan!

192
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,945

193
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:25,001
It is being increased of new

194
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,464
Sasuke-kun!
You do not have more to use the Sharingan!

195
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:34,629
Not to lower the guard!

196
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,469
Kabuto-saint!

197
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,475

00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:54,119
Stopped, Naruto!

199
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:56,200
It does not import how much you insist

200
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,915
 it originates it them is not between the copies!

201
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:04,809
Then from where is attacking the enemy?

202
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,385
If they are of the normal copies,
they would not have to succeed to attack!

203
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,067
If we knew it, we would not have to strain a lot.

204
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:15,005
This is the plan of the enemy.

205
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:19,220
I cannot use the Kage Bunshin are sfinito!

206
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,904

209
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:40,197
Those true ones have hidden under earth and attack
camouflaging itself between the shadows of the cloni.

210
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,662
Kabuto-saint!

211
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:24,559

00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,844

00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:58,392

243
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:25,015
Orochimaru-sama.

244
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,844

245
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:30,832
 in how much spy of the Village of the Sound.

246
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:33,580
My opinion does not have some importance

247
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,375
You are

248
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,115
 that you decide all.

249
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:45,460

00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:54,592
Sakura, hour I am well.

253
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,633
Ah..si

254
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,686

255
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,480

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,682

Hey!
It watches that one!

259
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,202
If you do not possess the Sky

260
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,074
I do not understand nothing to us

261
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,734
If you do not possess the Sky,
it earns acquaintance and you be prepared.

262
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,834
If you do not possess the Earth,
you run for the fields and finds the force.

263
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,717
If you open the Sky and the Earth,
the dangerous way becomes sure.

264
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:24,952
This is the secret of "something" or "someone "
(Sakura does not succeed to understand)

265
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:26,986
It will be able to guide to you in your way.

266
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:29,423
Which thing means?

267
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:33,593
In that point it seems that one lacks word.

268
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:36,557
Sure one refers to the coils.

269
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:42,174
Creed that is saying to open
the coils of the Sky and the Earth.

270
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:04,430
Then we open them.

271
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,270
