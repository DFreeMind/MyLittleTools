00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:14,063
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:33,816
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:39,688
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:45,788
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:51,393
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,075
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:05,049
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:17,688
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:24,098
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:29,300
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:45,153
<i>The Weight of the Prized Artifact!</i>
More to the right!

12
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,919
Okay! Okay!

13
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,263
There it is! That's it!

14
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,155
But...

15
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,465
A teacup like this a treasure, huh...?

16
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,769
<i>A delivery mission?</i>

17
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,540
<i>No, it's delivery protection</i>
<i>to be exact.</i>

18
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,672
<i>There's a higher risk of danger</i>
<i>than a regular delivery.</i>

19
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:13,009
<i>The Beauty of Nature is a treasure</i>
<i>of national importance so to speak.</i>

20
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,219
<i>In monetary value, you could buy</i>
<i>one or two mountains with its value.</i>

21
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,023
<i>For real... ?

22
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:22,060
<i>I'd like you to deliver it safely</i>
<i>to Kale Avenue</i>

23
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,788
<i>where it will be put on exhibition.</i>

24
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:30,427
At any rate, what's with
that humongous safe?

25
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:32,695
You're late.

26
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,073
Kiba...

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,175
Lady Tsunade told me to come
as pursuit personnel

28
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:41,178
just in case something happens
to the delivery item...

29
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,777
Have you heard anything else?

30
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,344
Nothing special other than
it's an incredible treasure...

31
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:53,886
No Trespassing
Hey, you with the stupid look.

32
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,528
Huh?

33
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:01,666
Can't you see
the "no trespassing" sign, huh?!

34
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:07,534
No, we came here on a delivery mission
from Lady Tsunade for that thing.

35
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,936
That's right!
Here's the paperwork.

36
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,577
Huh?

37
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:15,279
Look out.
It's going to fall!

38
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:22,544
Run, Naruto!

39
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:25,317
Hey, what're you doing, bro?

40
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,220
Hm? What're you doing?!
Stop it, quickly!

41
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:33,159
You came on a mission, didn't you?!
Get to work, you idiots!

42
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,532
H Hey!

43
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:38,735
Even if you die, don't knock it over!

44
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,009
All right!

45
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,577
All right!

46
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:53,373
That was close...

47
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:57,645
S So what should we do with this, bro?

48
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,282
Die.

49
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,324
You jerk...

50
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,461
As for you brother, what kind
of person are you?!

51
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:16,631
We were just about to die!

52
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:17,875
Huh?

53
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:21,804
Ninja are supposed to risk their lives
on a commissioned mission, right?

54
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,981
Just a minute, buddy!

55
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:26,444
I'm not your buddy!

56
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:29,985
I'm your client on this mission, Shinemon.

57
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,716
Come on...
Get a move on if you're not dead.

58
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:38,589
Akamaru, Fang over Fang!

59
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,832
No, I'll pound him
with my Rasengan!

60
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,527
Don't get so serious!

61
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:48,470
Hey! What's the deal?!
Are you guys not fired up?!

62
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:51,542
Jeez. Getting all
uselessly carried away.

63
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,837
You'll get no sympathy
if you get all tired later on!

64
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:57,413
This here is not like you guys, this here!

65
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:07,753
So you got too carried away
and dropped it?

66
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,721
I'm so sorry!

67
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,701
Jeez... Well, we've got the time,

68
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,996
so I guess all we can do
is go down and get it.

69
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:25,342
No... It seems we don't
have that much time.

70
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:26,811
Huh?

71
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:36,182
Wh What do we do, Kiba?!

72
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,250
If we took the roundabout way,
we'd never make it in time!

73
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:41,359
All right!

74
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,826
All right?
What're you going to do, buddy?!

75
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,794
Let's bungee jump!

76
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,197
Why me...?!

77
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,604
Die like you just don't care!
I'll pick up your bones for you!

78
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,539
I did it!

79
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,185
No way?!

80
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,721
That was a close one.

81
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,360
Idiot! Naruto, behind you, behind you!

82
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:18,996
Huh? What?

83
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,933
No way!

84
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,179
That was a close one...

85
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,255
Y You...

86
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,384
You got a problem? Huh?

87
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:53,025
A Ninja expects to lose his life
on a mission, right?!

88
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:57,232
Buddy, you want to try dying once?

89
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:00,872
Don't stop me, Kiba!

90
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,931
I'll pound him no matter what
with my Rasengan!

91
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:05,670
S Stop it! Calm down, Naruto!

92
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,641
I'm really sorry!

93
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,889
Hey, act more natural.

94
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,393
You idiot...

95
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:32,403
I am acting natural,
no matter how you look at it...!

96
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,300
No way... Totally unnatural...

97
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,300
Just a minute, you guys.

98
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:42,780
Jeez...

99
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,608
It seems there's something
very valuable in there...

100
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:49,051
If you like,
we could carry it for you instead.

101
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:51,517
Now... Hand it over here.

102
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:53,451
We'll carry it for you with care.

103
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,751
N No...

104
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:57,727
It's not really anything valuable.

105
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:59,923
I mean, how should I put it... right?

106
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:05,800
That's right. It's not like that at all.
Right, buddy?

107
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:09,201
What're you guys talking about?!
It's extremely valuable.

108
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:13,040
Have you forgotten that there's
a national treasure class relic inside?!

109
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,303
It's the Beauty of Nature!

110
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,406
It's the Beauty of Nature
more valuable than human life!

111
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,780
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!

112
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:23,420
Wh What're you saying?!

113
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,752
Hey, buddy, do you understand
the situation?!

114
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,917
Shut up! Situation?
You gotta be kidding!

115
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:31,622
I absolutely won't forgive anyone
who insults the Beauty of Nature!

116
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:35,160
So... A treasure more valuable
than life, huh?

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,626
Then you won't have a problem
with being killed, right?

118
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:45,471
Oh, sorry... I must be going
as I've got cram school today.

119
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:52,916
Run!

120
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:54,508
- Hey, hold it!
- Hey, hold it!

121
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:59,551
I'll take care of things here.
You escape with Shinemon, Kiba!

122
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,989
Right! Come on!

123
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:12,836
Others have popped up!

124
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:15,069
What're you doing escaping with me?!

125
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:17,798
Do something quickly, you idiot!

126
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:20,041
Jeez, what a jerk...!

127
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,080
You go on ahead!

128
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,617
Okay... Let's go, Akamaru!

129
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,629
A battle has started again, huh?

130
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:41,659
Yes. A battle has started again.

131
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,864
It's a sad thing.

132
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,169
Yes. It's a sad thing.

133
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:50,934
H Hey!

134
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,311
You're late, you idiots.

135
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,113
I'll get you, no matter what!

136
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:04,246
Akamaru, Fang Over Fang!
Fang Over Fang!

137
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,523
I It's a joke, man! A joke!

138
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:29,573
At last we've nailed down the location
of the treasured Beauty of Nature...

139
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,530
Something coming!

140
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,135
Buddy, you stay right here!

141
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,237
R-Right...!

142
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,636
Stop hiding and come on out!

143
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,312
A smoke screen.
That's a good idea...!

144
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:07,610
What're you doing
getting impressed, you idiot?!

145
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,117
Do something, quickly!

146
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,245
We know!

147
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:12,623
Let's go, Kiba!

148
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,724
Yeah!

149
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,350
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

150
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,025
Now, let's tear it up, Akamaru!

151
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,763
Since our vision has been sealed,
we'll just use scent!

152
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,264
Let's show them, Akamaru!

153
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,000
Where are you hiding?!

154
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,311
The Beauty of Nature is mine.

155
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,417
Oh no!

156
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,110
Let's go, Akamaru!

157
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,048
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:

158
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,220
Man Beast Clone!

159
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,821
Fang Over Fang!

160
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,592
Then... we'll do this! Akamaru!

161
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,098
Dynamic Marking!

162
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:05,936
Whoa! What's this?!

163
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,110
Buddy, what's the matter?!

164
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,578
S Something's salty!

165
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,141
I'm coming!

166
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:14,117
Naruto, where are you?!

167
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,380
Get over here now, you idiot!

168
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,954
You're late, Naruto!

169
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:37,831
You okay, buddy?

170
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,145
Naruto...

171
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,884
Spraying piss?!
I'll pound you guys for sure!

172
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,117
Taking back the treasure comes first!

173
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,918
That's right!

174
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:59,389
Oh man! I knew I should've
taken charge of it!

175
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:02,599
If we trace the scent of
Akamaru's Dynamic Marking,

176
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,827
it should work out, but...

177
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,833
I see, Akamaru...
They're still not far?

178
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:11,501
All right, let's go!

179
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,575
We did it... We finally did it!

180
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,718
What're you doing?

181
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:24,755
Shut up!

182
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:28,982
They came to take this back!
Let's get out of here!

183
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,655
You won't get away!

184
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:32,821
Hold it!

185
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,392
Impertinent! Go!

186
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,000
We'll handle things here.

187
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:42,967
So you go after him!

188
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,870
- Right!
- Let's go, Kiba!

189
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:45,910
Right!

190
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:49,741
Hold it!

191
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,522
You won't get away, you jerk!

192
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,720
It ends here! See you later!

193
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,132
Let's hurry!

194
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,077
I won't hand it over...!

195
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:22,513
Let go!

196
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,451
Boy, I was going to let you
slide by with your life, but...

197
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:36,861
Give it back...

198
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:42,199
The Beauty of Nature...
Give it back...!

199
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,640
Haven't you
misunderstood something?

200
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:56,073
You'll let me off with my life?

201
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,647
That Beauty of Nature...

202
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:04,655
is a super first rate treasure
more precious than human life...

203
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:10,025
The question of my life
was never of a concern!

204
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,320
Don't make light of me! Got that?!

205
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,397
You okay, buddy?!

206
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,347
Jeez, you Genin are really useless.

207
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:37,250
You're all beaten up yourself, buddy!

208
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,718
Y You jerk!

209
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:44,224
Damn it! I'll put an end
to things here at once!

210
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:52,736
Everything's over!

211
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:55,530
We'll be in a fix
if we don't hurry, Naruto!

212
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,731
Let's get a move on, brother!

213
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,245
Buddy!

214
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:06,477
Quick! Take the Beauty of Nature
to a safe location.

215
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,949
No way, what're you saying

216
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,213
You'll get crushed if you don't hurry.

217
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:13,824
Wh What're you guys looking at?!

218
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,790
Take the Beauty of Nature while you can...

219
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,222
What're you saying?!

220
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:20,331
Hurry!

221
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,339
Buddy! You okay?!

222
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,909
Oh! The Beauty of Nature!

223
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:48,248
Don't move, buddy!
Gently, hold out your hand!

224
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,025
Idiot, what're you doing?!

225
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,735
Just hurry up and come this way!

226
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,071
You guys are the idiots!
Forget about me.

227
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:03,706
If you're Ninja,
do something about

228
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,709
the Beauty of Nature
rather than my life!

229
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,679
Naruto, let's just forget
about this guy!

230
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,381
He should just die like
a dog on his own!

231
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:13,741
Let's hurry and get out of here!

232
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,082
Yeah, do as you like!

233
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,971
The Beauty of Nature...

234
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:42,913
Brother!

235
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,556
<i>Am I...going to die...?</i>

236
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,296
<i>We were just about to die!</i>

237
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:00,731
Huh?

238
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,025
<i>Ninja are supposed to</i>
<i>risk their lives</i>

239
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:04,534
<i>on a commissioned mission, right?</i>

240
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,303
<i>Come on...</i>
<i>Get a move on if you're not dead.</i>

241
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,839
<i>It's the Beauty of Nature!</i>

242
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:20,209
<i>It's the Beauty of Nature,</i>
<i>more valuable than human life!</i>

243
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,749
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!

244
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,948
<i>I'm gonna...just like this...</i>

245
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,320
<i>Haven't you misunderstood something?</i>

246
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,923
<i>You'll let me off with my life?</i>

247
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,634
<i>That Beauty of Nature...</i>

248
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:43,334
<i>is a super first rate treasure</i>
<i>more precious than human life...</i>

249
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:48,878
<i>The question of my life</i>
<i>was never a concern!</i>

250
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:52,983
<i>Heck no...</i>

251
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:57,916
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

252
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:13,561
There's nothing in this world
more valuable than life!

253
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,921
Nice... bungee jump...

254
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,401
Now then, what shall I do now?

255
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,376
Y Yeah...

256
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:56,707
Sure enough...
without the treasure...

257
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:03,044
Don't mope like that.
That's why you guys are useless.

258
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:07,016
But there's no point without
the treasure after all!

259
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,553
Huh? If there isn't one,
then I just have to make one.

260
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:13,292
Make...? You say that
like it's easy, but...

261
00:20:19,237 --> 00:20:20,568
That's a picture of you, buddy.

262
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,530
The creator of the dauntless artifact...

263
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,577
Beauty of Nature...
Shinemon, the living national treasure?

264
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:28,804
So basically...?

265
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:34,377
That means you made
the Beauty of Nature, buddy?!

266
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:38,278
But, you're... the client...

267
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,154
You got a problem

268
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:43,751
with the client being the creator
and a living national treasure?

269
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,324
But no matter how you look at it...

270
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:50,559
This here's not like you guys!
This here!

271
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:52,493
Well, you know...

272
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:56,529
It means my life rather than
the treasure was the correct answer.

273
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,837
You do pretty good work for Genin.

274
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:02,538
Thanks for the help.

275
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:05,076
Now then, I guess I'll hurry

276
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,743
and make a masterpiece to
exceed the Beauty of Nature!

277
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:23,530
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

278
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:29,870
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

279
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:39,680
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

280
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,278
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

281
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:49,224
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

282
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:54,094
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

283
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:59,068
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

284
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:03,300
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

285
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:07,777
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

286
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:15,183
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

287
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,086
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

288
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:24,355
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

289
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:28,489
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

290
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:33,367
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

291

<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

292
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:44,206
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

293
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:54,922
Your mission is to take that Ninja Dropout
we caught all the way to the capital.

294
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,152
What's a Ninja Dropout?

295
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,092
It's a gang of thieves consisting
of Rogue Ninja,

296
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:00,357
who don't consider themselves
Shinobi anymore.

297
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:03,399
I can't forgive them for using
their Shinobi powers for evil.

298
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,128
So, well, you can figure out
the rest by now.

299
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:07,363
In other words,
there is a possibility that they will

300
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:08,700
come to save one of their own.

301
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:09,865
Exactly.

302
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,932
You are assigned to the mission
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!

303
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:14,344
