Hey, waited for a moment.

185
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,940
Eh? Kyuuroku.

186
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,350
During the race, Idate has been made to help from a Ninja.

187
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,740
E' against the rules.

188
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,880
How?

189
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,490
I have the tests.

190
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,110
Watched this photo.

191
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:54,350
The rule of the race says that it must be arrived to the goal with the own forces.

192
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,680
Therefore, Idate is disqualified.

193
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,350
The winner is Hikyakuya Fukusuke of the Wagarashi family.

194
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
But…

195
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,180
Waited for! This was…

196
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,140
Not there are excusing!

197
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,010
Jirocho, was a scomessa, is not cos ì?

198
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,660
They hate that the Wasabi family is announced publicly immediately!

199
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,500
Aspects a moment.

200
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,840
This rule does not exist. You do not say idiozie.

201
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,460
My Getlteman…

202
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,500
There is some reason for which you want that the Wagarashi family wins?

203
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,650
Not, absolutely…

204
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,190
Perhaps why if the Wagarashi family loses, you cannot make more one what like this.

205
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,660
Watched.

206
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,190
It Jokes! She withdraws to you from your position and becomes a monaco!

207
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,340
, Getlteman.

208
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,320
Wagarashi Kyuuroki.

209
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,460
, Getlteman.

210
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,840
Contacts have reported also of your bad ones you to me.

211
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,620
The punishment to give to the village of Degarashi will be heavy.

212
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,800
Therefore, from today the Wagarashi family will be announced publicly!

213
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,470
Understood…

214
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,540
, Getlteman…!

215
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,200
Today splendid day is one!

216
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,950
All it has been resolved.

217
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,220
Thanks for all the aid, Naruto.

218
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,180
Idate, is time of dirci goodbye.

219
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,860
They have come to take the wounded.

220
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,820
Ibiki-saint.

221
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,540

222
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,540

228
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,590

232
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,890
The person who called me "Bro" is died three years ago.

233
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,150
Bro.

234
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,720
Hour, I know the answer of the tenth question.

249
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,320
Sasuke-kun, you are badly?

250
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,590
Not…

251

They are content… Once it arrives you to the village your wounds will be recovered.

252

253
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,310
Then the voices were true.

254
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,610
The heir of the Uchiha clan is more the weak person than all.

255
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,180
They are not successful to strike it…

256
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,930
But he…

257
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,550
