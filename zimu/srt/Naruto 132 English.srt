1
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:16,876
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:21,472
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:26,313
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,387 --> 00:00:29,584
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,789
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:40,164
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:45,539
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:49,133
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,512
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,515
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,883
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,351
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,966
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:14,298
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,169
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,435
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,977
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:27,411
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,825
<i>For a Friend!</i>

21
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,796
What did you say?!

22
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,937
You mean to say that only rookies
went after Sasuke?!

23
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,574
It really couldn't be helped...

24
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:58,441
the situation in
the Village being how it is...

25
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,350
And anyway...

26
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:08,248
I've taken the minimally
required measures.

27
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:14,654
Hey, hey!

28
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,492
Your mission has already
been assigned!

29
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:20,625
Uh, I'm gonna go do an errand
and will be back shortly...

30
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:22,994
Don't worry.

31
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,309
Geez...

32
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,348
Kakashi Sensei!

33
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,352
Kakashi Sensei!

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,448
It's already been two days
since Sasuke left the village...

35
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,753
And Naruto and the others who went in
pursuit haven't come back either.

36
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:49,991
And neither has Lee...

37
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:53,591
I know. I've more or less
heard the whole story.

38
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,399
I... believe in Naruto!

39
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:03,069
I believe him, but if something were
to happen to Naruto and Sasuke

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,747
Sakura, you don't need to
worry about anything.

41
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,214
Leave this to me.

42
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:30,668
Summoning Jutsu!

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,741
First of all, I want you guys to
fan out in all directions

44
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,184
in pursuit of Naruto
and Sasuke's scent.

45
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:50,052
Naruto and Sasuke you said?

46
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,824
Did something happen
to the two of them?

47
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,889
I'll explain later...
Right now, time is of essence.

48
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:58,787
Okay.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,500
As soon as you confirm that
you've detected the scent,

50
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,593
call me and I'll be there immediately.

51
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,038
All right! Scatter!

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,510
<i>Well, I guess since she saw them</i>
<i>fight before her very eyes...</i>

53
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,181
<i>it's useless to tell her</i>
<i>not to worry.</i>

54
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,257
<i>Stop!</i>

55
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:36,334
Damn...

56
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,260
I can't stop...

57
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:01,791
<i>Sasuke Stop with revenge.</i>

58
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:02,862
<i>What?!</i>

59
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,363
<i>Even if you were successful</i>
<i>in carrying out your revenge,</i>

60
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,162
<i>all that will come out of it</i>
<i>is a sense of emptiness.</i>

61
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,496
<i>Shut up!</i>

62
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,299
<i>What do you know?!</i>

63
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,597
<i>Don't say that so knowingly!</i>

64
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,905
<i>Well...calm down.</i>

65
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,537
<i>Neither you nor I could</i>
<i>call ourselves lucky.</i>

66
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:22,781
<i>Of that much I'm certain.</i>

67
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,382
<i>But it could be worse.</i>

68
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:32,251
<i>Both you and I have found</i>
<i>precious comrades, right?</i>

69
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:38,493
<i>We understand that all the more</i>
<i>because we've lost them once.</i>

70
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,199
<i>I taught you Chidori</i>

71
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:43,634
<i>because you now have</i>
<i>precious people.</i>

72
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:49,472
<i>That power isn't something to be used</i>
<i>against your comrades or for revenge.</i>

73
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,607
<i>You know what that power</i>
<i>should be used for.</i>

74
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,042
<i>I'm gonna win no matter what!</i>

75
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,016
<i>Don't get so carried away!</i>

76
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,354
<i>I was too ..</i>

77
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,347
<i>Watching them, they might actually</i>
<i>be intent on killing each other...</i>

78
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:18,132
<i>Kakashi Sensei...</i>

79
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,735
<i>Please let me get there</i>
<i>in time!</i>

80
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,985
I already said this earlier but...

81
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:47,233
In truth, you were waiting
for this too, weren't you?

82
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:51,099
Neither Kakashi nor Sakura
are present right now.

83
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,667
So there's nobody here to stop us
like that time before.

84
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,536
You...!

85
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,307
This time around we're gonna
settle this for real!

86
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:05,952
I will take you down!

87
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:16,887
Chidori!

88
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,064
<i>You idiot...</i>

89
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,636
Same here!
I'm gonna clobber you...

90
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,373
and take you back home even
if I have to drag you!

91
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,012
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

92
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,929
Rasengan!

93
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,097
<i>It wasn't meaningless...</i>

94
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:39,605
<i>To me, you became</i>
<i>my closest friend.</i>

95
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:45,784
<i>Sasuke actually came out</i>
<i>and said that...to me...</i>

96
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:50,050
<i>And that's exactly the reason why</i>
<i>I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.</i>

97
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,175
<i>Damn...</i>

98
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,676
<i>Damn you!</i>

99
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,395
<i>Damn...</i>

100
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,906
<i>He was able to counter</i>

101
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:42,965
<i>my full power of Chidori</i>
<i>to that extent...</i>

102
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,240
<i>That jutsu...</i>

103
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,685
<i>Damn...</i>

104
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,393
<i>Naruto, to what extent...!</i>

105
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,330
<i>That loser...</i>

106
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,141
<i>Naruto...!</i>

107
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:33,550
<i>Well, your limit is two blows...</i>
<i>that's about it.</i>

108
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,828
<i>And if I try to use more than that...</i>

109
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,526
<i>what will happen?</i>

110
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,634
<i>The third blow won't initiate.</i>

111
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,566
<i>Remember that well.</i>

112
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,468
<i>If you try to initiate</i>
<i>the Jutsu forcibly...</i>

113
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:52,978
<i>not only will the Art not</i>
<i>initiate properly,</i>

114
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:55,037
<i>but your Chakra will become zero...</i>

115
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,447
<i>In the worst case scenario</i>
<i>it will cost you your life!</i>

116
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:02,815
<i>Damn... I can't waste a blow...</i>

117
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,290
<i>It wouldn't serve any purpose</i>
<i>if we cancel each other like earlier.</i>

118
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:17,731
<i>There's...no longer</i>
<i>any mistake about this.</i>

119
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:27,680
<i>You...really intended...</i>

120
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:39,992
<i>You really intended to...</i>

121
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,667
<i>Sasuke!</i>

122
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:59,367
<i>I will use numerous speedy techniques</i>
<i>and Jutsu to create an opening.</i>

123
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,711
<i>And then...I will make</i>
<i>a hit with Chidori.</i>

124
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,945
<i>Sasuke...</i>

125
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,997
Did you know, Naruto...

126
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:27,830
Top class Ninja should be
able to read each other's hearts

127
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:30,536
simply by an exchange of fists.

128
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,148
Even without saying anything...

129
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,690
You're , Naruto.

130
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:50,422
How about it?

131
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:55,165
Were you really able
to read inside...

132
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:57,294
this heart of mine?

133
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,736
<i>Fire Style.</i>
<i>Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i>

134
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:27,526
<i>Sasuke... I knew that you</i>
<i>were always alone.</i>

135
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:32,534
<i>At first, I was relieved</i>
<i>when I found out</i>

136
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:36,133
<i>that there was</i>
<i>a guy similar to myself.</i>

137
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,281
<i>And it also made me happy...</i>

138
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:46,708
<i>To tell the truth, I really wanted</i>
<i>to approach you right away.</i>

139
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:55,058
<i>But...I wasn't able to approach you...</i>

140
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,358
- Awesome...
- You're incredible...

141
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,567
<i>You were always able</i>
<i>to do everything.</i>

142
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,205
<i>And moreover, you were always</i>
<i>being praised by everyone.</i>

143
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:22,211
<i>Because you and I
<i>were so different...</i>

144
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:26,956
<i>Because I didn't want to admit it,</i>
<i>I decided to call you my rival.</i>

145
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,289
<i>I didn't want to lose to you...</i>

146
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,163
<i>and I felt that even more strongly...</i>

147
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:37,601
<i>because I was called a loser.</i>

148
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,565
<i>Even when we were</i>
<i>in the Squad Seven,</i>

149
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,974
<i>I continued to feel</i>
<i>the same way the whole time.</i>

150
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,437
<i>I'm stubborn...</i>

151
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,583
<i>And wasn't able to express</i>
<i>what I really felt...</i>

152
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:58,585
<i>What I really wanted was</i>
<i>to become like you.</i>

153
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:06,022
<i>You were what I aspired to...so...</i>

154
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,162
<i>You are one of the ones</i>
<i>I want to fight.</i>

155
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:15,334
<i>I was really happy when</i>
<i>you said that!</i>

156
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:21,975
<i>Those were your first words...</i>
<i>acknowledging me...</i>

157
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,889
<i>You and I both knew,</i>

158
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:33,926
<i>without us even having to</i>
<i>have an exchange of fists!</i>

159
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,719
<i>From that time on...

160
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,292
<i>Even without saying anything...</i>

161
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,560
<i>The fact that...</i>

162
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:46,197
<i>we are friends!</i>

163
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:51,801
<i>It's not without meaning...</i>

164
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,709
<i>To me you're...</i>

165
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,711
<i>my closest friend.</i>

166
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:05,750
<i>However...you're trying to</i>
<i>take me down for real.</i>

167
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,091
<i>Right now, I don't really know</i>

168
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:12,894
<i>whether you really meant</i>
<i>what you said earlier or not.</i>

169
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,797
<i>Thinking that we were friends...</i>

170
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,835
<i>That might have been...</i>

171
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,878
<i>That might have been just me...</i>

172
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,278
It's too late now!

173
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,147
Naruto!

174
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:43,624
<i>If that's the case...I'm...</i>

175
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:51,563
<i>really lame, aren't I...</i>

176
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,405
<i>Sasuke!</i>

177
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:12,883
<i>But...</i>

178
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,551
<i>It can't be helped, can it?</i>

179
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,195
<i>I don't know why but...</i>

180
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:58,696
<i>I don't know why...</i>

181
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,633
<i>But I...</i>

182
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,342
<i>I...

183
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,279
<i>don't want you...</i>

184
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,957
<i>you to be taken away</i>
<i>by someone like Orochimaru!</i>

185
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,037
You managed to divert it
with your left hand,

186
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,540
but it was meaningless.

187
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,388
You won't be able to use
any hand sign

188
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,719
or that Jutsu earlier anymore.

189
00:18:58,698 --> 00:18:59,960
<i>This is the end!</i>

190
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,585
<i>Wh What's...</i>

191
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,817
<i>that red Chakra...?</i>

192
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:30,659
<i>Where does he get that</i>
<i>kind of power from?!</i>

193
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,808
<i>W What the heck...is this?!</i>

194
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:22,675
<i>His shoulder injury is healing...</i>

195
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,582
<i>That's unbelievable!</i>

196
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:04,389
Sasuke! I'm not gonna let
Orochimaru take you away!

197
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,885
I will stop you,

198
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:14,263
even if I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs!

199
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:29,441
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

200
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:35,818
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

201
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:46,389
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

202
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:56,165
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

203
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,904
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

204
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:12,215
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

205
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:23,928
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

206
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:34,370
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

207
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:47,124
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

208
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,292
Don't you talk stupid like that!

209
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:59,265
I don't care what
you're thinking anymore!

210
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:02,268
I won't let you go to Orochimaru's
place no matter what!

211
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:07,304
I'm taking you back to the village
even if I have to drag you there!

212
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,742
Sasuke! You're my...

213
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:15,686
