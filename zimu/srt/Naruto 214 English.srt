1
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:13,937
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,663
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,267
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:57,949
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:04,923
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:17,562
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:44,489
His music is a Ninjutsu?

12
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:49,691
Yeah! Awesome Chakra started bursting
throughout my body.

13
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,670
My power goes up like crazy!

14
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,400
That's a rare Jutsu, isn't it?

15
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:59,608
Shizune, have we identified the one
who attacked the villagers?

16
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:01,876
No, not yet...

17
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,911
Menma. I've once heard of
a Jutsu similar to yours.

18
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,280
- What?!
- Is that true, Grandma?!

19
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,518
I seem to recall that
the Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu

20
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,251
that use musical instruments as
the catalysts.

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,223
Land of Rice Paddies?
You mean <i>that</i> Land of Rice Paddies?

22
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,187
Come to think of it,

23
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,460
the upper part of the mountain stream
where Naruto found Menma was...

24
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,659
Land of R ice Paddies?

25
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,999
Please allow me to go there!

26
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,101
But infiltrating another land
without cause is...

27
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:30,642
No, we do have cause!

28
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:34,980
There might be hints there
about Menma's lost memory.

29
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:37,010
I'd also like to make that request.

30
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:40,113
Very well.

31
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,718
Excellent, Grandma!
Now you're talking!

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,084
Thank you.

33
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:57,799
<i>Bringing Back Reality</i>

34
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:01,438
And so we'll be heading out for a bit.

35
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,735
R ight, got it.

36
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,134
The special pickled bamboo shoots
should be ready

37
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:06,906
by the time you guys get back.

38
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,909
I can't wait. Bye!

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,384
Really, there's no real need
for you guys to come.

40
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,824
We have no choice. It's a mission.

41
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,757
Our mission is to accompany you guys!

42
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,333
<i>Now that it's settled...</i>

43
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,336
Let's get to the Land of R ice Paddies!

44
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:34,230
R ight.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,802
- Naruto.
- Huh?

46
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,131
You stay here.

47
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:38,034
Huh?

48
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,676
What do you want, Grandma?

49
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,847
If you're any kind of sorry excuse
for a Shinobi, you should know.

50
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:46,609
What?

51
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,415
I'm talking about Menma.
If that kid is a...

52
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,753
No way is he a bad guy.

53
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:53,850
I know he's not a bad person.

54
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,859
But can you state flatly that
he's not an enemy spy?

55
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,097
What're you driving at, Grandma?!

56
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,328
You couldn't have forgotten.

57
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,261
The Village Hidden in Sound
in the Land of Rice Paddies

58
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,704
is the place where Orochimaru
once hid himself.

59
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:09,102
Well, I...

60
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,204
I... remember that, but...

61
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,782
Menma's Jutsu is strikingly similar to that
of the opponent Shikamaru fought

62
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,115
when Sasuke was taken away.

63
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,380
There's no denying there's a chance

64
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,356
he's affiliated with
the Hidden Sound Village.

65
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:30,458
And if he remembers something and
that was to become a threat to this land...

66
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:41,740
<i>No way could Menma be an enemy...</i>
<i>That just can't be!</i>

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,081
We'll leave you behind if you dawdle!

68
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,684
Naruto, I'm going on ahead!

69
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:17,673
Are you hurt?

70
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,841
No... Thanks for the help.

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,977
You were going a bit too fast.

72
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,279
Let's take a break.

73
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,558
What the heck's wrong?!

74
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,258
Who in the world is he?

75
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,099
We're going to investigate
because we don't know that.

76
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,899
I was running at full speed earlier.

77
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,295
Losing my footing on the branch
after that was on purpose, though...

78
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,132
What?

79
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,469
Not only did he keep up with my speed,

80
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,444
but he even showed
the composure to save me.

81
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,313
He is better than us in terms of speed.

82
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:03,211
He'd be a troublesome opponent
if we end up fighting.

83
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:06,091
Wha?
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

84
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,851
He's not an enemy!

85
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,253
He risks his life to rescue babies.

86
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,456
And he's the kind of guy who,
if left on his own,

87
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,363
would help those in trouble all day!

88
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:25,671
That's a nice sound.

89
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,448
I still hadn't thanked you
for fixing this for me.

90
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,776
Don't worry about it.

91
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:35,545
Hey!

92
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,146
Stop playing that right now!

93
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,989
If you don't...

94
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,556
Neji. What's the big idea?!

95
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,089
You keep quiet!

96
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,396
What?!

97
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,760
It's as Neji says.

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,466
That might've been
a signal to an enemy!

99
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:51,967
A signal?

100
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:55,266
Lady Tsunade approved this mission
because the suspicious person

101
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,310
who entered the village the other day
still hasn't been caught!

102
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,279
If that intruder has followed Menma...

103
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,217
he should be close to us now.

104
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:07,544
No way...

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,350
As of this point, he hasn't shown
his presence, though.

106
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,422
Our mission is to accompany Naruto,

107
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:17,020
verify his identity and
to capture the intruder!

108
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:20,091
Sorry, but I don't trust you!

109
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,568
That's right...
It's natural I'd be thought of like that...

110
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,036
I think about this
from time to time...

111
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,439
What kind of a person was I?

112
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,480
What would I do if I were
a bad person...?

113
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:41,141
Naruto, what kind of person would
you want to be if you were reborn?

114
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,354
Wh What's this all of a sudden?

115
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:44,688
I'm speaking figuratively...

116
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:48,494
I've never thought about it.

117
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:49,658
I see...

118
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,197
But why do you ask
something like that?

119
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:54,257
Oh, no special reason...

120
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:58,601
What is it?

121
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,165
What's this smell?

122
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,541
Now that you mention it,
it smells like something's burning.

123
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:04,971
Over there.

124
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:05,801
Let's go.

125
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:14,645
The smell came from here...

126
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,180
Was there a fire or something...?

127
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,704
Is something wrong?

128
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:42,974
No...

129
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:44,909
It's nothing.

130
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,999
Don't move. I'll fire if you move.

131
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:04,265
What's the deal all of a sudden?

132
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,497
Are you their minions?

133
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:07,602
"Their?

134
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,565
You'll die here if
you're comrades of theirs.

135
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,201
For crying out loud, who are they?!

136
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,042
If you say you're not,
then show me some proof!

137
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,542
Proof, why? We're Leaf Shinobi.

138
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,118
Hidden Leaf Village?

139
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,084
See? Look at this.

140
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:23,717
Indeed that is...

141
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,117
What do Leaf Shinobi want
in a place like this?

142
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:31,927
Well, we just happened
to be passing through and...

143
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:34,329
As you can see, there's nothing here.

144
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,693
If you don't have business here,
just beat it.

145
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,403
If you don't,
we can't guarantee your life.

146
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:42,133
What's with him talking all big?!

147
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,343
Here, he was the one
who picked the fight.

148
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,043
Once we've had our breather,

149
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:54,712
let's blow this joint and go look
for Menma's memory.

150
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:56,286
R-R ight...

151
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,580
What? Did you remember something?

152
00:09:58,824 --> 00:09:59,518
No...

153
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,691
Who's there? Come on out.

154
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:16,805
Hello.

155
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,372
Y You guys are Ninja, right?

156
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,142
I heard what you were talking
about earlier...

157
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,355
Oh, well, I don't want to brag, but...

158
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:32,787
If you're talking about Naruto Uzumaki
from Hidden Leaf Village,

159
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,883
I'm pretty well known.

160
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,529
R eally? I'm sorry, I didn't know.

161
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,556
Why did you go to the trouble
of following us?

162
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,992
Umm... I had a favor to ask...

163
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,833
My older brother said
what he did earlier, but...

164
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:47,199
Older brother?!

165
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,968
That jerk from earlier?

166
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:52,742
We need someone to save our village!

167
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,607
A person to save your village...?

168
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:00,716
What do you mean?

169
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,682
This was the border of
the Land of R ice Paddies.

170
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,249
But...

171
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,483
as our land had caused trouble
for other lands,

172
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:12,959
this area was turned into
a demilitarized zone.

173
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,823
Are you talking about
that thing in question?

174
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,326
It must be the incident
involving Orochimaru.

175
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,939
That's how things were settled
with all the neighboring lands, huh?

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,904
But if it's a demilitarized zone,
there won't be any territorial dispute, right?

177
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:26,910
That's right.

178
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,046
It's not like that.

179
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,813
There's a small mine
in the hills behind the village

180
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,613
and a little bit of gold can be dug up.

181
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,179
Once it was discovered that mine is not
being supervised by a proprietary land,

182
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:39,418
bandits started coming with
their eyes on the gold...

183
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,550
No matter how often we asked
the feudal lord,

184
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:46,359
he would insist that, "Agreements between
fellow lands must not be broken."

185
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,856
And the village...

186
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,895
It was attacked by bandits, right?

187
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:55,805
They withdrew in the middle of it
due to a terrible storm before.

188
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,370
But they'll definitely be back.

189
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:01,469
I beg you. Please save our village.

190
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:04,180
You guys could fight them!

191
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,476
All right! Got it...

192
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,575
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:09,184
We can understand the situation,
but we can't cooperate.

194
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:12,051
Huh? What're you saying, Neji?!

195
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,289
We're in the middle of a mission!

196
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,587
We can't act unless
we have an official order from the village!

197
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:18,730
But...

198
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,526
Besides, we don't know
when the bandits will be back.

199
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,233
We can't just strand
ourselves here forever!

200
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,169
Damn it...

201
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:27,597
I see...

202
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,804
What're you doing Ran,
even bringing Fuki here?

203
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:31,839
Big Brother...

204
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:35,636
Don't get involved with them.
There's no such thing as a good Ninja.

205
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,142
Say what?!

206
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:38,442
I just stated the truth.

207
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,585
The rumor has it that the guys who
attacked the village were Rogue Shinobi

208
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,678
from the Hidden Sound Village.

209
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,648
Huh? The bandits are Ninja?

210
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:47,255
Come this way.

211
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:51,758
Look at that.

212
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,328
Wh What's this?!

213
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:58,495
One third of the villagers were killed
in the attack the other day.

214
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,771
Half of the rest abandoned
the village and fled.

215
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,075
Then you guys should also evacuate...

216
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:05,371
Where are we supposed to flee?!

217
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,612
This is ancestral land
that's been handed down to us

218
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:09,978
and that we've cultivated.

219
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,041
Why should we have to flee from that?!

220
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,978
Each time the hooligans
brandish their power,

221
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,919
we have to accept it like
a natural disaster and do nothing?!

222
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,456
Are we to just flee from place to place?!

223
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,015
Don't shout, Big Brother.

224
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:22,752
Fuki will get scared.

225
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,521
I'm sorry I shouted...

226
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,863
Her parents were killed by bandits
and she lost her ability to speak.

227
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,664
There's no place for us to escape.

228
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:38,901
If that's clear, then beat it already.

229
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:44,739
We have no choice.
Let's hurry on ahead.

230
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,045
I'm staying here.

231
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,712
Huh?

232
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:54,153
I want to be of use if
those people are in trouble.

233
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,156
Menma!

234
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:59,121
Hey, you don't even know
the scale of the bandits.

235
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,988
If you want to help them,
no matter what,

236
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,499
then w e should go back
to the village and...

237
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,728
We don't know when they might attack.

238
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,899
We don't have the time
to return to the village!

239
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,236
Then, I'm staying, too!

240
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,074
Naruto! Anything further than this
is beyond the scope of the mission!

241
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,845
This isn't beyond the scope
of the mission!

242
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,077
I get the feeling I'll be able to
remember something if I stay here.

243
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,377
Don't say irresponsible things!

244
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,147
You couldn't remember anything
just a moment ago...

245
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,586
That's too convenient!

246
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:27,558
It can't be helped, right?
Menma himself is saying so.

247
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:31,529
He's good -natured to a fault!

248
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:32,627
Naruto...

249
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,662
Let's go, Menma.

250
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:35,390
R ight.

251
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:36,764
Hey, Naruto!

252
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,232
We'll deal with the bandits.

253
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,198
Y ou guys go on back
to the village ahead.

254
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,500
What do we do, Neji?!

255
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:45,933
Leave them be.

256
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,473
It's unlikely the villagers will
accept Naruto and Menma.

257
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:50,809
You've got a point...

258
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:56,285
It seems the settlement on the other side
has escaped damage, huh?

259
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:59,648
But how're we supposed to protect
the village just the two of us?

260
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,926
Let's build a wall along this creek.
This river will play the role of a moat.

261
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:07,429
Ultimately we'll make a temporary bridge

262
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:09,261
and have the entrance to the village
in just one location.

263
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,627
I get it...

264
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,530
I don't know how effective it'll be,

265
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,630
but let's just do the best
we can now.

266
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:16,634
R ight.

267
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,295
What're you doing? I told you to get out.

268
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:50,471
We won't get out!

269
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,571
What did you say?!

270
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:55,504
We decided to protect
the village on our own.

271
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:58,911
Nobody asked you to do that.
It's none of your business!

272
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,676
You may say that,

273
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:04,245
but you can't beat them off
by just hiding in your houses!

274
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:08,285
All right, let's stabilize it with a stake.

275
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,224
Got it...

276
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:56,371
Jeez, what can they do
just the two of them?!

277
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:02,509
I'm ready...

278
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,440
Okay.

279
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,354
Tenten! You're still here?!

280
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,354
Can't you at least say thanks first?

281
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:21,831
Thanks, Tenten.

282
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,834
Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.

283
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:27,064
R-R ight...

284
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,071
You are...

285
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:37,979
For me?

286
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,778
Then I'll help myself.

287
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,253
Have this, too.

288
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:45,017
I'll help out, too.

289
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,342
You're mine!

290
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,647
Not yet!

291
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,283
That technique!

292
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:51,221
It's from that time!

293
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,152
Neji! You...

294
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:59,088
It's our mission this time around
to catch this guy.

295
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,696
Heh! This guy's formidable.

296
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,811
Damn it!

297
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,944
He's quick to escape!

298
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:32,761
Naruto!

299
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,543
<i>The sound waves pierced my whole</i>
<i>Chakra Network all at once</i>

300
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,580
<i>and amplified the flow of Chakra?</i>

301
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:52,849
I won't lose to the likes of this guy
if I have this Jutsu!

302
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,369
This is to avenge everyone.

303
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,232
Eat this!

304
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:18,633
You're in my way!

305
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:26,479
Menma!

306
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,612
Menma! Menma!

307
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,723
Carry him to the village.

308
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,225
Manma! Hang in there!

309
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:37,360
Boiling water and alcohol!

310
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:38,256
All right.

311
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,860
Are you going to treat him?

312
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:45,096
I may not look it,
but I've played at being a doctor.

313
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:47,935
We'll save you now, Menma.

314
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:50,932
What's the matter?

315
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,349
I cannot treat this guy...

316
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,313
Wh Why not?!

317
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:02,342
This mark...

318
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:06,356
He's a comrade of a guy
who attacked here...!

319
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,405
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

320
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:29,744
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

321
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,554
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

322
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:44,152
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

323
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:49,098
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

324
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:53,968
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

325
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,942
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

326
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,174
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

327
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:07,651
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>

00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,961

330
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:24,229
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

331
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,363
<i>You are probably searching for</i>

332
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,241

<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

335
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:53,462
Menma is not a member of the bandits.

336
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,399
I mean, he loves helping people!

337
00:22:56,701 --> 00:23:01,638
He's a type of guy who would even risk
his own life in order to save a kid!

338
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,770
For this villagertoo,

339
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,005
he has worked hard, so hard,
even though no one really asked for it.

340
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,770
He's got to have some kind of reason.

341
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,249
So please save Menma!

342
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:16,585
Next time: "A Past to Be Erased"
