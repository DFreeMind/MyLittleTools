2
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,703
It is definently your fate to lose against me.

3
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:05,902
Nobody knows that until the fight is over!

4
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:20,662
I don't know how much you've suffered by having
your father killed in the past, but...

5
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:27,442
It’s a huge mistake to believe that
fate's been already decided because of that.

6
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:30,785
You're hopeless.

7
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,667
Examiner... it's over.

8
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,910
Loser.

9
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:10,518
Deep Power of a Loser!

10
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,655
Don't run away.

11
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:29,786
I won't run away... I won't bend my words...

12
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,958
That's my Nindo.

13
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:50,976
I won't bend my words...

14
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:54,909
That's my Nindo, too.

15
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:59,148
Phrases I've heard before.

16
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:08,232
I won't lose against a guy like you... who's
always running away from your fate or whatever.

17
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:20,981
Don't preach like you know everything, kid!

18
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:26,640
Everybody is born with a fate that can't be refused.

19
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:40,428
Neji, stay alive. You're the one whose got the
most of Hyuga's ability in the entire clan.

20
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:48,482
I wish I could've had you born into Souke.

21
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:59,798
A guy like you won’t ever understand what its like to have
a seal that you can never get rid of your entire life!

22
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,386
Yeah, I do.

23
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:52,936
And then... so what?

24
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,400
You...

25
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:04,657
Don't act cool. You're not the only one who is "special".

26
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:14,356
Hinata, too, has been suffering like you've been.

27
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,078
She's been struggling to change herself, who's
not accepted even though she's Souke.

28
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:26,973
That's why she fought against
you even when she coughed up blood.

29
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,848
You're the same, too.

30
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:35,459
Even though this is an exam, you're the Bunke that's
supposed to protect the Souke yet you did that to Hinata.

31
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:40,804
You, too, were trying so hard to go against your fate!

32
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,837
The liveliness came back to Hinata's face.

33
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,391
He sure is ANBU.

34
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:06,085
It's alright now. She just needs to rest.

35
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,929
Your 64 tenketsu (chakra holes) are closed already.

36
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,197
How are you going to fight? In that condition you
won't be able to channel chakra for a while.

37
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,946
After all, you share the same fate with Hinata-sama

38
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:44,578
Shut up! You judge everything with your
Byakugan and talk like you know everything.

39
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:50,412
Then... let me see if what you're saying is right.

40
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:56,911
Yeah. I'll prove that by beating you no matter what.

41
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:05,778
Shit...shit. Although I said so, I can't feel chakra at all.

42
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,483
It's like the time when I used up
all my chakra during the training.

43
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:17,169
You have two types of chakra.

44
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:25,210
You need to pull the large chakra that's inside
of you, and channel to use it whenever you need it.

45
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,840
That's right. Kyubi's chakra... I need to...

46
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:47,435
Shit fox... Give me your power!

47
00:08:53,411 --> 00:09:02,556
The talk ends here. Examiner, I'm going to go at him with
the intent to kill. If you want to stop me, do as you wish.

48
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,242
Man...

49
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,143
I told you it's useless.

50
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,685
This time... I can not lose.

51
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,111
I'll win no matter what.

52
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:29,468
That's useless. All your tenketsu are
belong to us. I pressed all your tenketsu.

53
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,359
Definitely...

54
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:39,115
Oh yeah. Make sure to come see me beating up Neji.

55
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:51,183
A loser can beat up an elite with
hard work... It may be me going against him.

56
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:55,569
If it is you, Naruto-kun, no hard feelings.

57
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:10,127
Why are you trying so hard to go against your fate?

58
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:21,840
Because I was called a Loser!

59
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:45,110
No way. Chakra is flowing out... What's going on?

60
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:03,049
What on earth is he?

61
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:18,029
What is he?

62
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,922
No way... this chakra is...

63
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:24,710
This can't be...

64
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:30,670
No way... his tenketsu were pressed.

65
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:48,343
This chakra... it's no mistake... it's Kyubi's...
Since when did he learn he can use Kyubi's chakra?

66
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,495
I'm coming.

67
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:33,609
It's wrapping around him.

68
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,627
What is that? Is that chakra?

69
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:09,017
Incredible power... I can feel it more than in the training.

70
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,615
Kaiten!

71
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,469
What?

72
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:46,964
His speed increased. What's going on anyway?

73
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:20,989
You have confidence in close battle, don't you?

74
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:29,735
You become Hokage, eh? I guess you're not at that level.

75
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:38,035
Only handful of Shinobi will be
chosen to be Hokage. Look at reality.

76
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:48,964
Those who become Hokage are born with such a fate. It's
not something you can be because you want, but it's fate.

77
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:54,968
Everybody is different from each other. There's no
other way than to live in the flow that can't be changed.

78
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,752
I don't know if it's Hyuga's hateful fate or what, but...

79
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:07,553
If you say you can't, then you don't
need to do anything anymore!

80
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,920
Damn it... I need to start Kaiten!

81
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:13,557
Once I become Hokage,

82
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,535
I'll change Hyuga for you.

83
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:14,407
What a chakra. That kid released some
insane power... At this rate, the Hyuga kid may...

84
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,405
Hey, which one is Naruto?

85
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,791
I can't even tell which is which!

86
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:36,060
Neji's Kaiten is a technique to recoil the
opponent's chakra by spinning his body.

87
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:41,111
It seems that Naruto-kun got more damage
because he went straight to Neji.

88
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,005
There's no Genin who can win against Neji.

89
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:51,010
But Naruto-kun, you're incredible...
being able to push Neji this far.

90
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:58,291
Loser... Sorry to say but this is the reality.

91
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,390
This truly says...

92
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:36,459
I can’t move my body...

93
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:48,083
Leaving a Kagebunshin on the hole, and finding the way to win.

94
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:53,012
Even being beat up, he believed that
he could win and thought of the next move.

95
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:59,578
The power to believe in yourself
will become the power to change your fate...

96
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,867
This kid understands that...and it comes natural to him.

97
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:18,547
In that situation, you quickly did the Kagebunshin...
it is your favorite Ninjutsu. It was my carelessness.

98
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:28,695
I failed the graduation exam of the Academy three times.

99
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:40,596
With my bad luck, the Ninjutsu for the
exam was always the one I was worst at...

100
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:04,668
Bunshin-no-jutsu
was my worst skill.

101
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:18,069
Don't whine about fate or how you
can't change fate and all that stupid stuff.

102
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:34,730
You're not a loser unlike me.

103
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,244
Winner, Uzumaki Naruto
