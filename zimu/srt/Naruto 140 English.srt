1
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:26,245
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,516
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,722
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:40,096
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:45,471
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:49,065
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,444
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,447
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,815
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,283
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:08,157
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,898
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,230
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,101
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,367
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,909
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:27,344
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,764
<i>Two Heartbeats.</i>
<i>Kabuto's Trap</i>

21
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:50,498
Huh?!

22
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:55,975
It can't be!

23
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,776
Even if you put up a bluff
I can foresee...

24
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:06,309
that you are already... finished.

25
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:27,571
Poor thing.

26
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:31,733
This child is trembling
like a puppy

27
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:34,110
Now, Kabuto...

28
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,440
Get rid of her,
but don't make her suffer.

29
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:38,615
I understand.

30
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,418
<i>Sasuke...</i>

31
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,851
<i>I I'll do anything for you!</i>

32
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,731
<i>So I'm begging you...</i>
<i>Please stay here!</i>

33
00:02:57,337 --> 00:03:00,465
<i>You are really annoying.</i>

34
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:02,836
<i>Please don't go!</i>

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,138
<i>Sakura...</i>

36
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,981
<i>Thank you...</i>

37
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,924
Sasuke...

38
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:24,930
Wait!

39
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:26,259
Hmm?

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,691
Did you... say something?

41
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,194
Wait!

42
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,835
Where's Sasuke!
Where is Sasuke?

43
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,675
It couldn't be that...
your body is already Sasuke's...?

44
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,310
There's no need to keep it
a secret any longer.

45
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:49,483
It's all right, Kabuto,
go on and tell her.

46
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,559
He was a little late
in getting here.

47
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:04,096
Lord Orochimaru wasn't able to
wait for Sasuke,

48
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,104
and already had been reincarnated
into another vessel.

49
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,877
So Sasuke is all right?!
Somewhere in this building...

50
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:16,006
Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke
the Curse Mark,

51
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:19,346
so he could wait for
the next opportunity to reincarnate.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,350
But...

53
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:26,089
Not all humans can
tolerate Curse Marks.

54
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:43,339
No way, there's no way
that Sasuke could be...

55
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:48,309
That's right, Sasuke wasn't able
to tolerate the Curse Mark

56
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,405
and so he died.

57
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:52,040
That's a lie.

58
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:54,548
It has to be a lie!

59
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,392
What would telling a lie
like that accomplish?

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,526
To someone that's going to die...
As you are?

61
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:08,667
If you want to see him that badly
I'll let you see him.

62
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,401
When you die, you can see him
in the other world.

63
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,697
<i>Sasuke...</i>

64
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,262
Sakura!

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,936
Sakura, don't you believe...

66
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,339
what a guy like him says!

67
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,243
Naruto!

68
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:59,582
So it's Naruto, I thought you'd drowned
and died a long time ago but...

69
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,186
When I make a promise
I don't give up.

70
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,745
That's my Way of Ninja!

71
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,753
I ain't gonna die,
until I get Sasuke back!

72
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:10,522
This is interesting!

73
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:15,833
Sakura, go hide!

74
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:21,004
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

75
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,006
I'm over here!

76
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,140
Hey stupid, over here!
Over here, over here!

77
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,616
Where're you looking?
I'm over here! Over here!

78
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,847
What're you doing? Hey!

79
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,428
So you've used up all
your Kunai Knives...

80
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:57,635
I'm gonna... completely blow you away!

81
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,293
How annoying!

82
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,027
<i>Fire Style.</i>

83
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:19,860
<i>Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!</i>

84
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:27,733
- Ouch!
- That's hot!

85
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,933
- Yikes!
- Oww!

86
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:46,088
You're too slow!

87
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:48,592
Rasengan!

88
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:03,438
Naruto!

89
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:12,275
Since you and Orochimaru are here,

90
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,546
it means Sasuke is probably here too!

91
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,013
Tell us the truth right now!

92
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:28,027
Wh What the heck?
My body won't move...

93
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:34,669
Have a good look at yourself.

94
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,807
Wh What's this?

95
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,443
Those are Chakra Threads.

96
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:42,703
Chakra Threads?

97
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,415
While you were attacking earlier,

98
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,384
I wrapped the thread around you.

99
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,793
Take a good look at where
that thread is connected.

100
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,367
That's right.

101
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:05,102
Those Chakra Threads are...

102
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,208
connected to my heart's
Chakra Network.

103
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,041
And Naruto, the thread that's
wrapped around you

104
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:20,746
is connected through my Chakra Network
to your organs and to your heart.

105
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,783
See, can you hear that?

106
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,754
My heart and your heart will
eventually become connected as one!

107
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,828
- Damn!
- Naruto!

108
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:42,636
It's no use. That thread is formulated
and spun with Chakra

109
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,369
and it will absolutely not break.

110
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:54,117
Now our hearts are
completely synchronized...

111
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,215
The Chakra which passes
through this thread

112
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,523
via the Chakra Network from my heart
is controlling your heart, you see.

113
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:07,597
<i>It's no use, even though</i>
<i>it's my heart...</i>

114
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:12,300
If my heart beat gets faster,
your heart will get faster too...

115
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:16,133
And when my heart stops beating...

116
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,042
you will die too!

117
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,440
Don't! If you stop your heart,
you'll die too!

118
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:29,086
That's right.
But that doesn't mean much.

119
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:33,853
Since I've already promised
my body to Lord Orochimaru...

120
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:58,545
Wh What the heck are
you gonna do?!

121
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,018
If I crush this heart...

122
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,458
you will die too!

123
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:15,026
If I crush this heart...

124
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,799
you will die too!

125
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:22,605
Now, together we will...

126
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,178
Naruto!

127
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:30,337
How's it feel to have
your heart seized?

128
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,210
It'll be all right...

129
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,343
You'll be out of your misery
right away!

130
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,627
Stop it!

131
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:48,866
How foolish, if you kill me
Naruto will die too.

132
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,300
What I'm gonna cut...

133
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,034
is this!

134
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,637
There's no use you know,

135
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,310
It's impossible to cut thread formulated
and made from Chakra.

136
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:13,619
Even Lady Tsunade's great strength
wouldn't be able to break it.

137
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,393
<i>What should I...</i>
<i>What should I do?!</i>

138
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:26,097
<i>Naruto is suffering right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes and yet...</i>

139
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,138
<i>I can't do anything!</i>

140
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,237
Sakura...!

141
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,507
I... absolutely will not lose!

142
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,618
Until I've fulfilled my promise!

143
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,520
You bravado ends there.

144
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,994
Now, shall we die together?

145
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,461
And go to the place where
Sasuke is waiting?

146
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,053
Naruto!

147
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,289
Sakura!

148
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,829
- Sasame?!
- Sakura...

149
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,830
Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!

150
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,243
Naruto!

151
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:48,417
Naruto!

152
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:54,548
Naruto?!
Hey, are you okay? Naruto!

153
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,357
No way...

154
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:58,525
It can't be...

155
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:00,929
No way!

156
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,227
Naruto!

157
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:22,643
Ahh... My chest right now
is beating with joy.

158
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,153
Idiot! It was a waste for me
to have worried!

159
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:30,652
Sorry, Sakura...

160
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,827
You're so worthless!

161
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:39,329
That's right, Sasame!
Why are you here?

162
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,606
Well, it's...

163
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,169
I was saved by Sasame,
you know.

164
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,600
Me too.

165
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,036
What do you mean?

166
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,749
Water came rushing into that
trap pit we were in earlier...

167
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,134
<i>That's it! The lid to the pit!</i>

168
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:16,472
<i>Damn!</i>

169
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,484
When the water reached
the ceiling,

170
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,580
I desperately tried to open the lid,
but wasn't able to escape...

171
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:40,257
I was told by Master Jiraiya
to go to where Hanzaki is.

172
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:45,896
But I got concerned about Arashi,
so I came...

173
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:58,376
Naruto!

174
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,779
Hey! Thanks!

175
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:05,053
Th The frog spoke...!

176
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,323
Well, come to think of it,

177
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:13,991
there's no way you could open the lid
of the trap by pushing on it.

178
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,330
Geez!

179
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,568
But how come the thread that
I couldn't cut with the Kunai Knife,

180
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:22,471
be cut when I wrapped it
with Sasame's tag?

181
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,935
Because the Chakra Thread
is a Secret Technique

182
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,573
within the secrets of
our Fuuma Ninja Technique...

183
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,382
Of the Fuuma?!

184
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:36,213
Oh I see...
So who the heck is this?!

185
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:39,650
Oh!

186
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,605
She is... from earlier!

187
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,002
Mistress Kagero...

188
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,537
She's a Fuuma Jonin.

189
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,240
Sasame!

190
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,076
Sasame...

191
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:14,125
I was resurrected
by Lord Orochimaru...

192
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,593
You! You're being tricked
by Orochimaru!

193
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:19,330
Where is Sasuke?

194
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:23,528
And Arashi?
Where's Sasame's cousin!

195
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,767
Lord Orochimaru is...

196
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:32,541
going to raise our Fuuma clan...

197
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,170
to the center stage
of Shinobi again.

198
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,646
You're still talking about
that stuff?!

199
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,351
At least tell Sasame the truth!

200
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,331
So it's there! He's in there!

201
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:04,972
Sasame and Arashi...
You two were so close...

202
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,009
Then it'd be better
if you didn't see him.

203
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,068
Mistress Kagero...

204
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,912
What do you want to do, Sasame?

205
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,384
Do you want to wait here?

206
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,688
I will see him!
No matter what's in store for me!

207
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,193
I came all the way here
to see Arashi!

208
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:03,323
Yeah! You've got guts!

209
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,132
All right! Let's go together!

210
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:07,529
Yeah! Let's go!

211
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,908
Sasame...

212
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,779
There might be some sort of trap...

213
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,883
Leave it to me!

214
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,173
Orochimaru?!

215
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,408
Good of you to come, Sasame...

216
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:52,814
Why...?

217
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,057
Arashi...!

218
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,259
Arashi!

219
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:12,926
Arashi?

220
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,039
I'm no longer...

221
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,673
Arashi...

222
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,561
Wh What the heck is going on?!

223
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:52,437
The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin
were combined into one...

224
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:56,241
and I've been reborn as
the ultimate Ninja you see...

225
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:05,788
Now, I'll show you
my ultimate Ninjutsu... Sasame!

226
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,158
No... Arashi...

227
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,462
Damn, Orochimaru!

228
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,226
I will not forgive him,
no matter what!

229
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:29,173
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

230
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:35,550
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

231
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:46,121
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

232
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:55,897
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>
<i>and</i>

233
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:02,636
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

234
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:11,947
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

235
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:23,660
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

236
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:34,102
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

237
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:46,856
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

238
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:53,694
Sorry... I'm sorry, Naruto.

239
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,731
I haven't been able to do anything,
after all.

240
00:22:57,302 --> 00:23:00,703
I'm always dragging you down.
I hadn't changed at all.

241
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,599
But Naruto, Sasame,
you two taught me.

242
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,938
That's why I want to change
the kind of person I am!

243
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:12,417
This time, this time,
it's my turn to give it my all!

244
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,515
Next time, "Sakura's Determination!"
