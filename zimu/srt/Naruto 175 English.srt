1
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,839
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:26,649
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:29,281
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:31,882
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:36,487
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:46,405
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:55,776
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,751 --> 00:01:06,558
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:21,165
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:45,132
Hasn't this increased
since last month?

12
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,424
Yes, it has.

13
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,929
It's now widely known
in distant lands

14
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,698
that you were appointed to Hokage,
Lady Tsunade.

15
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:55,873
Bills have started to come in addressed
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.

16
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:59,369
Hokage is not something to take on.

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,474
<i>My name is Tsunade...</i>

18
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:07,153
<i>I'm the Fifth Hokage of</i>
<i>the Village Hidden in Leaves.</i>

19
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:10,649
<i>My concern now is a debt</i>
<i>that absolutely will not go down...</i>

20
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,021
<i>And...</i>

21
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:14,361
Grandma Tsunade!

22
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,363
- Hey wait!
- Naruto!

23
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:18,563
- Lemme go!
- Calm down!

24
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:22,592
If there aren't any missions,
let me go search for Sasuke!

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,637
You've been told to train,
haven't you, Naruto?!

26
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:28,671
Grandma Tsunade!

27
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,202
<i>That...</i>

28
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:39,451
<i>The Treasure Hunt is On!</i>

29
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:44,690
I won't let you through!

30
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,025
Goal!

31
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:58,528
Too bad.

32
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:04,236
But it's totally obvious since
it's the same person doing it.

33
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,805
There haven't been
any missions lately, either.

34
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:13,683
I wonder if the Pervy Sage will
come back soon...

35
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:16,080
I can't train by myself...

36
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:19,354
What, there was someone here
before me?

37
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,453
Huh? Kiba... Akamaru...

38
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:25,461
Here I thought I could take
my time to train.

39
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,395
Are you by yourself?
Where are Hinata and Shino?

40
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:33,737
Shino is backing up another team
with Kurenai Sensei...

41
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,933
Hinata said she'd train at home.

42
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:40,137
Is it like we've lost our jobs?

43
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,310
Don't say that...
I'll feel empty hearted...

44
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:44,241
Naruto! Kiba!

45
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:47,879
Hinata...

46
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,319
Weren't you training at home?

47
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:53,821
There was a call from the Hokage.
She wants us to come immediately.

48
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:54,754
Then...

49
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:58,092
All right! Our first mission in a while!

50
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,698
Treasure hunting?

51
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,540
That's right. This person here,
an old acquaintance of mine,

52
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:07,972
is our client this time around...

53
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,007
My name is Agari Kaisen.

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,550
Please look at this.

55
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,019
This is a map indicating
the location of the treasure.

56
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:22,445
It seems a treasure worth several
hundred million <i>ryo</i> lies buried there.

57
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:25,781
S Several hundred million?!

58
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:29,789
If I were to eat Ichiraku's
special portion ramen everyday...

59
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,459
I don't think you could eat all that
even if you spent your whole life eating...

60
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,137
Awesome!

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,435
But it's on the map, right?

62
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:44,672
Is this a job to go to the trouble
of asking Shinobi to do?

63
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:50,575
Yes. The treasure is in a location
difficult for ordinary people to get to.

64
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,911
Even I tried getting there...
but there was no way.

65
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:58,091
So it's the Shinobi's turn, huh?

66
00:04:58,693 --> 00:04:59,785
The deadline is in three days.

67
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,852
If you succeed, there will be
a special reward from Agari.

68
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,689
Set out with caution!

69
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:05,861
- Yes!
- Yes!

70
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:09,002
Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!

71
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:12,497
Indeed, it isn't a difficult mission.

72
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,407
However... if you fail...!

73
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,176
- What?!
- What?!

74
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,110
- Yay, yay!
- Hey, wait!

75
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:29,451
<i>If you fail...</i>

76
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:33,326
<i>you will go back to the Academy!</i>

77
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,927
- What?!
- What?!

78
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,789
You'll re enroll in the Academy

79
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:40,095
and re do your Ninja training
from square one.

80
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,962
Wh Why us...?

81
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:46,131
I looked up your mission success rate
over these past few months...

82
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,040
Naruto! You're decisively poor!

83
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:50,105
What?!

84
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,645
In particular, the success rate
when you team up

85
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:56,274
with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga
is hopelessly low!

86
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,783
<i>Now that she mentions it,</i>

87
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,151
<i>it's the members we failed</i>
<i>an earlier mission with...</i>

88
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,185
<i>We also failed before when</i>
<i>four of us, including Shino,</i>

89
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,127
<i>went looking for Bikochu Beetles...</i>

90
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,726
Something rings familiar, right?

91
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:18,436
But, just Naruto aside,

92
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,474
why should we also have
to go back to the Academy?

93
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,470
Collective responsibility is fundamental
in Ninja teams.

94
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,976
Everyone takes responsibility
for a failure.

95
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:29,206
Got it?!

96
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:39,392
It... it'll be okay. No way should we fail
at hunting for treasure...

97
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,158
If you don't drag us down.

98
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,732
What?! Don't <i>you</i> be dragging us down!

99
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:52,099
If we fail... we'll have to study
with these kids, right...?

100
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:02,910
Hey, what's up?

101
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,912
Naruto, Kiba, Hinata,
all three of you together?

102
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:07,277
Iruka Sensei...

103
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,120
You guys must have come
to miss the Academy, huh?

104
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:12,555
You could come back if you like.

105
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,960
I'll never go back!

106
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,759
What's with them...?

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,868
I'll make this mission a success
no matter what

108
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,567
and put Grandma Tsunade
to shame!

109
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,141
And I'll have no part of
going back...

110
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:32,645
to the Academy on account
of associating with you.

111
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:35,744
The failures until now
are a collective responsibility.

112
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,977
It's not just my responsibility!

113
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,212
I don't know about that.

114
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:43,923
The success rate of our team
without you in it is high.

115
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,687
Then I'll prove on this mission

116
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,523
who it is who really drags us down,
believe it!

117
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,154
That's just what I want.

118
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,198
<i>I wonder if this will be okay?</i>

119
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,341
It's a dead end!

120
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,979
So this is as far as
there's a path, huh?

121
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:19,886
There's a river up ahead.
How should we cross it...?

122
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:24,330
Then, here here.
We should cut straight through, right?!

123
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:29,235
Are you an idiot?
Mountain terrain isn't that simple.

124
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,064
I would go... this way.

125
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,403
Are you an idiot?
That's totally the long way around.

126
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,179
Then you want to compete
to see which is faster?

127
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,812
No way will I lose!

128
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,148
All right! The finish line
is that boulder!

129
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,479
Start! Let's go, Akamaru!

130
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,254
This will be a cinch!

131
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,387
What? What?

132
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,392
Wait, Naruto!

133
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,170
Naruto...

134
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:07,135
What?

135
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,409
It seems we're climbing up
quite a bit...

136
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:11,408
It's okay!

137
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,016
Naruto!

138
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,267
It's... okay.

139
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,396
We should be totally faster than Kiba, so...!

140
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,303
Yes! I win!

141
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:49,444
Something smells good...

142
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:54,378
Huh?

143
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:55,954
So you finally made it, huh?

144
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,254
Kiba!

145
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:00,525
You were so late I went ahead
and got some food ready...

146
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,925
Now then... which way?

147
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:13,534
We should...
we should just cut right though this!

148
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:18,374
Naruto!

149
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,172
Good grief...

150
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:28,781
W Water...

151
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,253
Here, water.

152
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,890
This way's definitely faster!

153
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,162
I sure slept well.

154
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:48,998
Akamaru and I often
train in mountains like this...

155
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:52,412
We know a lot more about
the mountains than you guys.

156
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,705
Shut up!

157
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,291
Shut up, I say!

158
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,483
Don't be acting all big just because
you won two or three times!

159
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,392
Not two or three times.
Five times!

160
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,490
S Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!

161
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:31,282
Naruto and the others
should be there pretty soon, huh...?

162
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:35,284
This mission looks easy at a glance.

163
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,982
But it won't go that easily...

164
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,588
They'll probably realize that.

165
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:50,602
A limestone cave, huh...?

166
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:51,930
But...

167
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,700
Geez, hurry up already!

168
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:57,102
You said the buried treasure is
in a limestone cave, right?

169
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:58,175
Just a minute!

170
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,204
The limestone cave is supposed
to be further ahead.

171
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:03,416
We shouldn't have been able
to find it this easily...

172
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:08,277
It's not like there are
that many limestone caves!

173
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,217
So here's fine...

174
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,414
Let's go, Hinata.

175
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:12,522
R-Right...

176
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,218
H-Hey, wait, you two!

177
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,428
I can't see anything...

178
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,277
Oh, it's a dead end...

179
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:32,840
It can't be!

180
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:36,010
Naruto! Hinata!

181
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,991
Look out! Run, you two!

182
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:47,650
Wha?

183
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,567
This... couldn't be over...

184
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:58,333
That person said it'd be okay
at just this extent...

185
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,477
What happened...?

186
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:12,241
By any chance,
was an enemy after us?

187
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:16,186
No... Akamaru's saying
he didn't smell anyone.

188
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,649
It was probably just an accident...

189
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,393
I told you this wasn't the right place!

190
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,259
But, as a person,
if you're looking for a limestone cave

191
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,696
and there's one right in front of you,

192
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,859
one would usually think
that's the place, right?!

193
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,232
Don't be getting smart with me.
Here I saved your butt!

194
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,468
I didn't ask you to save me.

195
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:36,766
What?!

196
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,341
Hey... you two...

197
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,581
A shard from the ceiling
hit you, huh...?

198
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:49,786
You okay?

199
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:53,660
It seems I'm the one
dragging us down...

200
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:59,331
Not at all!
If I had been more cautious...

201
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,832
At the end of the day,
it's your fault, Naruto.

202
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:02,732
Kiba!

203
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,704
Nevertheless, I'll have no part of
going back to the Academy

204
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:07,831
on account of associating
with you, Naruto...

205
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,434
Akamaru and I will find the treasure.

206
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,603
What're you saying, Kiba?!

207
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,041
There's no point if
we don't all do it together!

208
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:18,708
I'm... okay, so...

209
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,350
From here on, there will be locations
all along the way so rough

210
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,821
they are beyond comparison
to those up until this point...

211
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,627
It'll be nothing but places that
really only a Shinobi can get through!

212
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,825
It'd be absolutely impossible
for someone with an injured leg.

213
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:31,957
Oh...

214
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:35,899
Besides... we can't just leave someone
who's injured, right?

215
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:38,201
We need someone to stay with her.

216
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,396
Then it doesn't have to be me...

217
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,934
Can you find the treasure by yourself?

218
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,809
You can't read a map worth a damn
and you don't know the mountains...

219
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:48,345
To be straight...

220
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:51,942
we've wasted a ton of time
on your account, so!

221
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,054
Rest easy.

222
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,320
After I find the treasure,

223
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,586
you won't have to go back
to the Academy...

224
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,318
Let's go, Akamaru!

225
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,227
H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!

226
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,091
Damn it...!

227
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:11,394
Now.

228
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,001
Naruto!

229
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:14,764
Huh?

230
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,419
Are you awake, Naruto?

231
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,588
Hinata...

232
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:35,984
Naruto!

233
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,364
There are... two Hinatas!

234
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:44,868
Naruto...

235
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,003
Naruto...

236
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,407
Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?

237
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:55,508
Could it be... you were twins?!

238
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,774
- No!
- No!

239
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:57,941
Then...

240
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,345
One of you transformed into Hinata
with a Transformation Jutsu, huh...?

241
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:06,220
I can't... tell you apart at all...

242
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:07,919
I'm the real one!

243
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:09,724
I'm the real one!

244
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:13,157
Your voices are also
exactly the same!

245
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,599
I know.

246
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:16,362
At a time like this,

247
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,870
I should ask a question
that only the real one knows.

248
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,969
I'll come right out and ask!
What's Hinata's father's name?

249
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,172
- Hiashi Hyuga.
- Hiashi Hyuga.

250
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:30,848
Oh, yeah. As for me,
I didn't know Hinata's father's name.

251
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:31,947
<i>What?!</i>

252
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,217
- Naruto...
- Naruto...

253
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:37,389
At a time like this,
if Kiba and Akamaru were here...

254
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:40,987
Here they could tell by smell
which one is the real one...

255
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:43,752
Nope. It'd be impossible even
for a Ninja Hound...

256
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:44,455
What?

257
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,434
This isn't just an ordinary
Transformation Jutsu, so...

258
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,597
Mister... As I recall,
you're the client this time around...

259
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,130
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:56,672
It wasn't buried treasure that I wanted...

261
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,637
It was your faces.

262
00:16:59,012 --> 00:16:59,671
Faces?

263
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:03,645
I already got... your face...

264
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,446
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

265
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,752
That's... me...

266
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,152
I guess I'll be setting out
to get the last face...

267
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,922
Leave it to me!

268
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,210
This is the place...

269
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,610
This inside of the cave
is as the map says...

270
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:39,941
There's no doubt.

271
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:53,729
It's under this rock, huh?
I'll go in one shot!

272
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:00,830
Huh?

273
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:07,010
This, huh...?
I found it surprisingly easy.

274
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,779
What is it, Akamaru?

275
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:12,945
Kiba? That's you there, isn't it, Kiba?

276
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:15,516
Kiba?

277
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:17,749
Naruto... Hinata...

278
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,986
I told you guys to go
on back first, didn't I?!

279
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:24,126
Come on! Come on! Here we went
to the trouble of coming!

280
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,356
This mission is for the three of us, so...

281
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,762
Hinata... is your injury okay?

282
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:33,869
Yeah... I became able to move
after resting a bit, so...

283
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,908
Wow! You already found
the treasure?!

284
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,438
Then let's take it back
to the village quick!

285
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:41,909
Right...

286
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:47,510
<i>Wait... How did they get here</i>
<i>so fast without a map?</i>

287
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:51,017
<i>And moreover,</i>
<i>Naruto has zero sense of direction...</i>

288
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:53,818
<i>And Hinata has an injured leg...</i>

289
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:00,327
<i>Akamaru...doesn't seem to be feeling</i>
<i>any particular suspicion.</i>

290
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,424
<i>Am I being paranoid...?</i>

291
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,175
It seems they're back.

292
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,512
Kiba! Akamaru!

293
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:22,981
Heh! Didn't we tell you?

294
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,083
Even a Ninja Hound's nose
can't tell the difference...

295
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:31,756
Let's begin.

296
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,562
Face Copying d utsu!

297
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,110
What's that...?

298
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:51,376
We also copied faces like this.

299
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,283
As you can see,

300
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,150
when performing
the Face Copying Jutsu,

301
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,621
the person being copied
must be close by.

302
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,185
And moreover,
it takes a degree of time.

303
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,254
But once a face has been copied once,
it's an impeccable Transformation Jutsu

304
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,823
that is beyond even
a family's recognition.

305
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:09,330
No way...

306
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,799
Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!

307
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,107
Wh What the hell are you...?!

308
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,867
I'm Kiba Inuzuka.

309
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:25,714
You guys...

310
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:28,776
What's the big idea?!

311
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,049
Kiba!

312
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,014
Kiba!

313
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,894
Those are the real ones, huh...?

314
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,807
Who the hell are you guys?

315
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,578
The name of our clan
is the Kedouin Clan.

316
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,640
We're a clan that possesses
the secret Face Copying Jutsu.

317
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,780
Why our faces?

318
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:04,423
We're going to return to the Village
Hidden in Leaves in your place,

319
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,283
and mess up the village good!

320
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:34,485
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

321
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,286
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

322
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,892
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

323
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,895
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

324
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:47,957
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

325
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:50,536
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

326
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:53,795
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

327
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:55,671
<i>The images.</i>

328
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,681
<i>It probably will not end</i>

329
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:09,077
<i>It probably will not end</i>

330
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:13,927
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

331
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:16,953
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

332
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,997
<i>Running freely</i>

333
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:23,627
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

334
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:26,729
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

335
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,707
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

336
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,312
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

337
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,584
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

338
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:43,088
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

339
00:22:51,364 --> 00:22:52,126
Like I said,

340
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,063
nothing good ever comes from
a mission together with you, Naruto.

341
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,225
This isn't the time to be complaining.

342
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:56,461
They're intending to
head for the village.

343
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,299
Then, how do we get out of here?

344
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:59,597
- Listen.
- With Rasengan, I'II...

345
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:00,900
No good. They'll notice.

346
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:02,532
- I can...
- Then use your Fang Over Fang.

347
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,244
- It'd be the same, you idiot.
- That's why I said...

348
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:05,768
- Then, what do we do?
- Use that, I'm telling you...

349
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:06,709
Naruto!

350
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,872
- Don't stop me, Hinata.
- Don't stop me, Hinata.

351
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:09,809
