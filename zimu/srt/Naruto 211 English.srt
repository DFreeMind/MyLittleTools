00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:13,937
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,663
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,267
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:57,949
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:04,923
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:17,562
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,723
Who are you guys?

12
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,199
They want to fight, it seems.

13
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:04,013
<i>I won't be fooled.</i>
<i>You...you...</i>

14
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:16,762
Todoroki!

15
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,996
Stop it, Todoroki!

16
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:28,899
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?

17
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:33,968
This guy... There's no way
I'll forgive this guy!

18
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,779
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:44,089
This guy... killed my family...
he killed my little brother!

20
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,758
Wh What was that...?

21
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,724
Gantetsu killed your family?

22
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,066
Yeah.

23
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,437
Five years ago.

24
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,236
I'm positive that
this is the guy I saw.

25
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,481
Fire!

26
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:21,760
Oh!

27
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,231
This is horrible...

28
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,021
Is anybody still inside?

29
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,307
Damn!

30
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:42,480
Father! Mother!

31
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,561
Akio.

32
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:01,834
Akio!

33
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,034
Memory of Flames

34
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,136
Akio...

35
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,992
<i>Todoroki, I found out who</i>
<i>attacked your family.</i>

36
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,700
<i>Really?</i>

37
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:11,132
<i>A gang of bandits called</i>
<i>the Ninja Dropouts.</i>

38
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:12,871
<i>Ninja Dropouts?</i>

39
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,433
<i>They're ruthless...</i>
<i>Evil personified...</i>

40
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,312
<i>When they rob the victims</i>
<i>of money and valuables...</i>

41
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,143
<i>They massacre everyone in that house.</i>

42
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:23,982
<i>Why?</i>

43
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,912
<i>So as not to leave any witnesses behind.</i>

44
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,519
<i>The bodies of your parents</i>
<i>were found but...</i>

45
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:42,294
<i>The fire spread quickly and</i>
<i>Akio was still small so...</i>

46
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,728
<i>Probably nothing of him remained.</i>

47
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,231
<i>I'm sorry, but you need to</i>
<i>let your little brother go...</i>

48
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,577
<i>That's impossible.</i>

49
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:53,940
<i>I can't do that.</i>

50
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,519
Damn it!

51
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,231
It's ironic, isn't it...

52
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:26,843
When I finally find the killer
of my parents and little brother...

53
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:30,474
My mission... forces me
to escort him to the capital.

54
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:32,451
Todoroki.

55
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,151
I'm a full fledged police officer now.
I'm not a spring chicken!

56
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:41,460
I didn't mean to bring
my personal grudges onto the job...

57
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,360
This guy will eventually
be sentenced to death...

58
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,499
That thought has allowed me to endure.

59
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,168
But, right now,
right in front of my eyes...

60
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,629
The same face in the flame...
The face that killed my little brother!

61
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:58,167
Your... little brother?!

62
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,574
Die, Gantetsu!

63
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,510
- Don't get in my way!
- Stop!

64
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:12,382
He's a thug who's killed
countless innocent people.

65
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:16,422
It's your mission to deliver Gantetsu
to the capital, right?!

66
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:19,932
It doesn't matter!
He killed my little brother!

67
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,926
It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but...

68
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,337
You can't do that...

69
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:27,932
There's nobody watching...

70
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,434
That's right, here in the middle
of this forest.

71
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,001
H-Hey, Todoroki?

72
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,242
Nobody's watching...
There's no way they'll know.

73
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:41,344
Todoroki... I said, calm down!
I'm telling you, I'm watching!

74
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,421
No, nobody's watching...

75
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,024
Todoroki!

76
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:48,555
As long as you keep your mouth shut...

77
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,525
No... Better yet, if you w eren't around...

78
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,925
Wait a second!

79
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,666
What the heck are you thinking?
Calm down!

80
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,898
I'm extremely calm.

81
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,769
You too must...

82
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,137
It can't be helped...

83
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:08,614
If things come to this,
I guess I have no choice but to fight!

84
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,885
What's the matter?

85
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:14,710
Why don't you just come
right out and fight?!

86
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,949
You guys, too! Why don't you stop hiding?
Come out and show yourselves!

87
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,462
Huh?

88
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:24,756
Y You guys are...

89
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:26,896
Stop bullying Gantetsu!

90
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,626
Give Gantetsu back!

91
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,324
What is this?

92
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,664
I have no idea...
Who the heck are they?

93
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,907
Everybody!

94
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,404
W Wait a minute...

95
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,803
How are you connected
to Gantetsu?

96
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,653
Stop that!

97
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,687
Let's get out of here!

98
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:56,452
Calm down.

99
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:57,696
We should be able to
understand each other

100
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:58,730
if we just try to talk things over.

101
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,324
You guys aren't Shinobi, are you?!

102
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:04,161
It's dangerous for amateurs
to hold blades!

103
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,335
Lee, what are we gonna do?

104
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:07,739
This is a problem...

105
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,734
'Cause if our opponents are amateurs,
we can't go all out...

106
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,238
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

107
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,950
Damn it! Let go of me!

108
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:33,221
I need to avenge the deaths
of my family... and my little brother!

109
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,925
Calm down!

110
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,632
Calm down and think about
this whole thing ag ain!

111
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,134
Your... little brother?

112
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,267
Don't be stupid, Gantetsu...
Don't come over here right now!

113
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:50,549
Gantetsu!

114
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,228
What's going on?!

115
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:12,069
Damn it, I can't move!

116
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:13,438
It's futile.

117
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,042
That string is stronger than steel.

118
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,410
There's no way you'll be able
to cut through it

119
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:20,445
with human strength alone.

120
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,010
Who the heck are you?

121
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.

122
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,012
Ninja Dropout you said?

123
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,890
I, Monju will take Gantetsu.

124
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,292
As long as I have him,
I have no more business with you guys.

125
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,827
Those nets will shrink
as the temperature rises.

126
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,194
So you'll suffer till the end.

127
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,861
In half an hour or so...

128
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,263
It will cut you into pieces.

129
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,913
Farewell!

130
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:58,074
Todoroki!

131
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,545
Gantetsu!

132
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,494
Damn it... I'm not about to die
in a place like this.

133
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:21,402
Our mission is to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital...

134
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:24,138
Are you an idiot?
Take a good look at this situation!

135
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,108
We'll be goners before that happens.

136
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:31,774
I don't believe that those Ninja Dropouts
are Gantetsu's comrades.

137
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:38,589
Gantetsu was telling the truth.
Those guys might kill Gantetsu.

138
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:41,116
That's why I should have killed him
with my own hands!

139
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,454
But remember, that guy was
calling out your name to the very end!

140
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,854
So what's up with that?!

141
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,732
There must be something
he wanted to tell you!

142
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,833
I don't want to hear
any excuses from a thug!

143
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,508
I find it hard to believe that
Gantetsu's that evil a guy.

144
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,677
What was that?!

145
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:01,936
I'm telling you,
I'm not about to kick the bucket

146
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,279
until I've heard what Gantetsu
wanted to say!

147
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:16,820
Stop it!

148
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,859
Hey, I'm positive we can work
things out if we just talk.

149
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,135
Shut up!

150
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,969
Wait.
Let's stop this.

151
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,106
I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout,
because you're a Ninja.

152
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,909
We're Shinobi from the Leaf Village.

153
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,476
We were called here to be
part of the police escort

154
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:35,844
taking Gantetsu to the capital.

155
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,377
Please spare Gantetsu.

156
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,145
That can't happen.

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,546
Gantetsu saved us from
the Ninja Dropouts.

158
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:45,991
Saved you?

159
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:47,915
Who in the world are you guys?

160
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:52,762
We're all kids whose families
were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.

161
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,000
But Gantetsu secretly rescued us

162
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,334
because he wanted to save
at least the children...

163
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,573
What was that?!

164
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,039
Gantetsu took care of all of us kids
who had become orphans...

165
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,497
Gantetsu.

166
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:34,930
Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?

167
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:37,709
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,774
Where am I?

169
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,279
So you woke up.

170
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,480
Mother...? Father...?

171
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,513
Where's Mother?

172
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,582
You poor thing...
But we're all in the same boat.

173
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,025
You're not alone...
We're here for you...

174
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,859
We're your new family.

175
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,638
I'm leaving the Ninja Dropouts!

176
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,111
I can't stand this any longer.

177
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:19,511
I can't commit robberies with
those guys anymore.

178
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,814
But if you don't,
they'll kill you, Gantetsu.

179
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,580
I'll steal their money.

180
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,025
Huh?

181
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,185
And I'll get myself captured
by the police.

182
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:30,428
Come on...

183
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,355
If I do that,

184
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:35,889
they'll show up in front of
the prison to try to get me back.

185
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,029
That's the only way
they can be captured.

186
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:40,101
Are you saying you're gonna
be a decoy...?

187
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,602
It's so that there won't be
any more victims.

188
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:45,974
This is my only choice.

189
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,610
Gantetsu really did steal their money
and was captured by the police.

190
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,684
We came to this forest

191
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,085
because we were worried
about Gantetsu's safety.

192
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,021
We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts
would get caught. However...

193
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,392
So Gantetsu reformed himself

194
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:07,193
and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?

195
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:11,901
We have to do something about
the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!

196
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:15,137
I don't really care about
the Ninja Dropouts right now.

197
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:17,708
What's important is that
we rescue Gantetsu.

198
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,945
I'm guessing that Gantetsu
is with Naruto.

199
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:25,841
Don't worry because he won't have
been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.

200
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,449
Okay, let's believe that.

201
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:38,354
Damn...

202
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:52,769
If things continue like this,
we'll turn into dried fish.

203
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:03,922
Huh?

204
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,684
H Hey... It loosens up a little
when sweat soaks into it.

205
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,127
What?

206
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,161
Are you serious?

207
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,295
Oh, you're right.

208
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,834
Yeah, I know...

209
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:33,618
<i>What?!</i>

210
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,717
<i>I'm used to its venom.</i>
<i>It's nothing.</i>

211
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:52,368
<i>I find it hard to believe</i>
<i>that Gantetsu's that evil a guy.</i>

212
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,772
I'm gonna meet up with Gantetsu
one more time

213
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,570
and find out for myself,
no matter what it takes...

214
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,515
That's right...
I need to see Gantetsu again, too.

215
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,613
I will then avenge the deaths
of my family... and of my little brother.

216
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,435
We did it!

217
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,730
That was a narrow escape!

218
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:31,202
All right... Let's hurry up and
rescue Gantetsu!

219
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,877
Yeah... I will find him no matter what
and I'll cut him down!

220
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:43,354
Huh?

221
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,728
- Gantetsu.
- Huh?

222
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:54,956
That's definitely Gantetsu.

223
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,768
Those guys are...

224
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,406
I Idiot...

225
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,709
- Gantetsu!
- Gantetsu!

226
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,746
Gantetsu!

227
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,517
That's as far as you'll go, kid.

228
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,787
That guy is...

229
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,283
Don't tell me he's a Ninja Dropout?!

230
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,191
Good answer.

231
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,725
I'm Monju, a Ninja Dropout.

232
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,559
Give Gantetsu back!

233
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,697
I'm not forgiving you for this!

234
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,233
Hey, hey...

235
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,858
Who are these little brats?

236
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,394
Perhaps they're inexperienced
in the ways of the world, but...

237
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:35,235
to tell me to give Gantetsu back...

238
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,638
Give us back what we want.
That's our line, right?

239
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,440
Who the heck are you guys?

240
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:43,939
You Ninja Dropout jerks...

241
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:45,910
We are avenging our families' deaths!

242
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,218
What?!

243
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,894
You brats just stay quiet.

244
00:18:58,997 --> 00:18:59,964
Damn it!

245
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,326
Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!

246
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,133
It looks like you don't quite comprehend
the position you're in right now, huh?!

247
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:11,166
And moreover, what do they mean
by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!

248
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,779
Stop!

249
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,182
Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!

250
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,654
It's my turn!

251
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:28,823
It doesn't even budge.

252
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:31,923
It's useless... You won't be able to
tear through this net.

253
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:35,229
Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.

254
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,001
I refuse.

255
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:38,670
Huh... I see.

256
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:40,796
Then how about this?

257
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:46,803
Akio!

258
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,044
Stop it! I get it.
I'll talk, so please stop!

259
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:53,551
You should have done that
from the start.

260
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,289
These children are the children
from the homes

261
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:00,621
that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.

262
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:03,821
I rescued them and gave them shelter.

263
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:06,931
What? You betrayed us?

264
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,665
I see... You jerk...

265
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,428
You took our treasures and
gave them to these guys.

266
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,506
They belonged to their families
in the first place.

267
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:20,136
Don't mess around with me...
You traitor!

268
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,476
Stop that!

269
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,315
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

270
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,778
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!

271
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,020
Naruto!

272
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,748
Naruto, you were safe!

273
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,123
Of course I was!

274
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:38,161
I'm not handing Gantetsu over
to you no matter what!

275
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:46,471
Gantetsu.

276
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:11,896
That's...

277
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:14,332
It can't be...!

Is that the Ninja Dropout's hideout?

00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:55,491
Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.

296
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,832
Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards.
I can never forgive them.

297
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,335
How dare they interfere with
the happy return of the siblings!

298
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:02,631
This is outrageous.

299
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:04,197
All right, let's go, Bushy Brows!

300
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,904
I'm always okay to go.
Even if the enemy is an ex Shinobi...

301
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:09,774
We're going to beat them one and all,

302
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,043
and definitely going to get
