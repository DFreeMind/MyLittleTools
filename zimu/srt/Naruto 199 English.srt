1
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:03,525
<i>Rock away your existence</i>,

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:06,360
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:12,463
<i>A new journey begins now</i>.

4
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:28,921
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons</i>,

5
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:34,358
<i>we gained knowledge and strength</i>,
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:37,055
<i>But the forgotten memories</i>,

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,566
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time</i>,

8
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:45,093
<i>have also been lost</i>.

9
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,733
<i>When sinking down</i>,
<i>we learned loneliness</i>.

10
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,774
<i>But now we've met each other</i>,
<i>we are no longer alone</i>.

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,220
<i>Unveil your feelings</i>,
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:07,624
<i>Those tears will change your fate</i>.

13
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,788
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness</i>,

14
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:19,602
<i>We're sure to meet</i>,
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:52,294
<i>The Missed Target</i>

16
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,030
Naruto , Choji, gather all of them !

17
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,209
I know!

18
00:01:58,344 --> 00:01:59,311
Yeah!

19
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,375
Shadow CIone Jutsu!

20
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,851
Pick it up! Pick it up!

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,785
Over here!

22
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:10,755
Over there!

23
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,723
Don't lose any of them !

24
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,657
Yeah!

25
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,592
Pick it up!

26
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,563
Over there!

27
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,496
Go over there!

28
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,501
Hey that's mine!

29
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,899
Partial Expansion Jutsu !

30
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,238
Arm!

31
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:30,907
<i>Where did that bird go?</i>

32
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,111
<i>Damn it! We lost it!</i>

33
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,253
Over there!

34
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,925
Just a IittIe more. . .

35
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,857
This is a mission beIieve it or not!

36
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,993
This is something very important. . .

37
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:02,837
I beg you. . .
PIease Iet go of it!

38
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,645
We have troubIe, Lady Tsunade!

39
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:09,315
What is it?!

40
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:10,982
Those papers
scattered throughout the viIIage,

41
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,382
are the pIans that were stoIen
from the carpenter boss.

42
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,747
CurrentIy, Shikamaru and his team
have finished coIIecting aII the pIans,

43
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,415
and rechecking them.

44
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,293
But it seems like they have
collected all of them .

45
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,258
What is the meaning of this?

46
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:24,563
I have no idea. . .

47
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,488
Lady Tsunade! We have a report

48
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,534
from those who headed to
the Hidden WaterfaII ViIIage!

49
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:30,102
Was there movement?!

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,202
ActuaIIy, it turns out that it was onIy
a Iarge scaIe practice run!

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,039
They are saying that they see
no signs of an invasion of Leaf ViIIage.

52
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,512
What?!

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,307
It seems as though they have
aIready finished their practice run,

54
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,146
and the Hidden WaterfaII ViIIage
is back to normaI.

55
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,715
So Genno and Hidden WaterfaII ViIIage
have nothing to do with each other. . . ?

56
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,457
Disengage the S-Level
Emergency Security Alert!

57
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,118
Order aII forces back to viIIage!

58
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:56,795
Yes!

59
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,457
What in the worId
was that man pIotting?!

60
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:12,845
Lady Tsunade!

61
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,173
What now?!

62
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,074
The body that
the Anbu Black-Ops gathered ...

63
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:19,585
It's. . .

64
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,979
It's not Genno. . . ?

65
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,083
What does that mean?

66
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,525
But I thought that Old Man Genno was
cornered by the Anbu Black Ops

67
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:31,824
and bIew himseIf up.

68
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:36,798
He traded pIaces with a corpse that
he had ready right before the expIosion. . .

69
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,401
That's a huge possibiIity!

70
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,538
We're in the middIe of confirming that!

71
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,476
Their appearances Iook simiIar,
but smaII detaiIs bring up questions!

72
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,813
Most IikeIy. . . it's another man.

73
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,778
Are you teIIing me
he fooIed the Anbu BIack Ops!

74
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,914
That means, Genno is. . .

75
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,990
He's still alive!

76
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,689
Damn! What is that man up to ...?

77
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,741
Over there.
Behind that tree.

78
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,188
It's here!

79
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:37,319
I see. . . The OId Man Genno used
this hoIe to get away.

80
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,226
He camouflag ed it well.

81
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,762
If it wasn't for the Byakugan,
we wouId have missed it.

82
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,137
Not only that ...

83
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:49,371
This hoIe is made so that it cIoses
naturaIIy by the weight of the earth.

84
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,039
If we came here another day Iater,

85
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,408
it wouId have been
extremeIy difficuIt to find,

86
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,504
even with the Byakugan.

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,217
And to prove that,

88
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:01,720
you can bareIy see any sign of
an entrance to this hoIe.

89
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,748
Akamaru, can you foIIow his scent?

90
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:13,354
He's even got getting rid of
his smeII covered. . .

91
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,764
Where couId he have gone?

92
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,274
Our concIusion is that. . .

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,740
OId Man Genno is stiII aIive

94
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,841
and there's a possibiIity that
he's hiding in Leaf ViIIage.

95
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,755
He got cornered,
and faked his own suicide,

96
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,814
and stoIe the pIans so that he couId. . .

97
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,224
make aII of us turn our eyes outside
of the viIIage.

98
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,457
He couId have aIready known
about the big practice run

99
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,899
in the Hidden WaterfaII ViIIage
and used that to his advantage.

100
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:57,004
B-But the Anbu Black Ops
started to mark Genno because

101
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,375
they happened to find out that his Ietter
of recommendation was a fake, right?

102
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:02,675
Was it a coincident. . . ?

103
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:08,385
Isn't it strange that
a reaI Ietter of recommendation was

104
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:12,151
at the house of the carpenter boss
he worked for?

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,928
Then what is his true goaI?

106
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:20,228
If we knew the answer to that,
we wouIdn't be struggIing so much. . .

107
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,500
Shikamaru!

108
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:23,259
The onIy thing I can say now is. . .

109
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:28,266
The number of Shinobi in this village
currently is at its lowest ever.

110
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:32,771
We onIy have a bare minimum
of us here!

111
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,708
And most of their eyes are
Iooking outside of the viIIage.

112
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,988
Even if Genno was waIking around
as he was humming on the streets,

113
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:43,751
no one wouId suspect anything of him .

114
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,451
Did he set a trap in the villaget ? !

115
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,689
CouId the fact that that
he scattered the pIans around mean that

116
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,627
he's aIready done setting his trap?

117
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:57,835
No , this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.

118
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,835
We can't Ieave this pIace
without any security,

119
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:03,808
but we have few peopIe. . .

120
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,741
Then where do we Iook?

121
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:08,914
The Academy.

122
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:10,282
The Academy?

123
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:14,341
Why the Academy out of all
the important facilities in the villaget ?

124
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,047
Out of aII the sites Genno worked on,

125
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,183
onIy the Academy's repair pIan
was stoIen.

126
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,522
It's hard to think that
it was a coincidence

127
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:24,995
for it to disappear at this timing.

128
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:34,540
Byakugan !

129
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:48,520
WeII?

130
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,720
There's nothing in this room.

131
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,226
Then. . . move ahead to the next room.

132
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:57,696
Byakugan !

133
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,329
Seems Iike there's nothing in this area

134
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,405
Can't you Iook at
the entire campus at once?

135
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,935
And we have Hinata too, you know?

136
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,371
That wouId be possibIe
if we know what the target was,

137
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,747
but we're Iooking for
something suspicious.

138
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,050
We'II have to take the basic route.

139
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,645
Hey! Wait a minute!

140
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,247
You're in the way!

141
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,326
And there's too many. . . peopIe here.

142
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,019
Like I said !

143
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:36,196
AII I want is for you guys to come outside
even just for a moment!

144
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:41,237
Our teacher toId us to study on our own
in the cIassroom for today!

145
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:44,299
We can't go out of the room!

146
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,305
There are no teachers today!

147
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,582
So nobody wouId know
if you Ieft the cIass!

148
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:55,619
We used to skip cIass when
Iruka Sensei wasn't Iooking

149
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,952
when we were younger.

150
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,986
Oh! Adelinquent!

151
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,462
- Delinquent !
-Delinquent !

152
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,725
We have to check this area!

153
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:11,468
Besides, all the teachers have gone
on a mission to protect the village.

154
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,365
Why are you guys stiII here?

155
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,237
They must be useIess.

156
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,209
What did you say?!
We're aIso protecting the viIIage too. . .

157
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,181
Naruto. You're wasting time

158
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,117
Let's crush them !

159
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,351
What?

160
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,051
The Expansion Jutsu!

161
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,054
We're going to teII on you to our teacher!

162
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,164
Yeah, do as you pIease!

163
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:40,999
Idiot!

164
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:43,926
Let's practice our Kunai Knives.

165
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,270
Sounds good.

166
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:53,274
It doesn't seem Iike
there's anything suspicious. . .

167
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,811
Hurry up!

168
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:01,549
Wait!

169
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,626
Come on.
I'm begging you to Ieave!

170
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,030
Naruto!

171
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:17,930
Where did those kids from
the next classroom go?

172
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:19,805
I don't know. . .

173
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,306
They were going to practice
their Kunai Knives.

174
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,602
That's what they were saying.

175
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,602
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

176
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:31,311
They're practicing their Kunai Knives
in a pIace Iike that?

177
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,256
I'II do next.

178
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,382
Ok. Do your best!

179
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,425
Do it !

180
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:41,860
Yeah!

181
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,857
Oh, so cIose.

182
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,598
They reaIIy are practicing. . .

183
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,897
When we were
students at the Academy,

184
00:11:55,975 --> 00:11:58,034
we used to skip class and come here.

185
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:05,142
The teacher's couIdn't find us here,
it reaIIy was great!

186
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,882
I read comic books, and took naps. . .

187
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:11,380
That's right, I ate potato chips.

188
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,091
WeII, that's no good!

189
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,554
You can Iearn something from those kids.

190
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,492
Even if the teachers doesn't see you ,

191
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:19,997
you shouId stiII commit to your practice!

192
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,725
They're true modeIs of students!

193
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:28,032
WonderfuI!
I'm excited! I'm moved!

194
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,700
I'd Iike to take cIass with them!

195
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,204
We wouIdn't want to interrupt.
Let's go.

196
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,149
Yeah. . .

197
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:38,650
Naruto ...

198
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,118
What?

199
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,915
Did they have that before?

200
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,457
I'm going to get this one!

201
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,795
Ouch!

202
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,966
I had it!

203
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,004
It seems pretty new.

204
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,374
Genno couId have made it. . .

205
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:15,281
I I'm going to get Neji or Hinata!

206
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,885
You guys get out of the way.

207
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,019
You're getting in the way of our practice.

208
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,089
O Oh I'm sorry!

209
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,298
I'm next!

210
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,434
Byakugan !

211
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,339
It's a Paper Bomb!
It's hidden behind the waII!

212
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,810
What, inside the waII?!

213
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,546
It's compIeteIy hidden inside the waII.

214
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:49,076
But then how do you
detonate it ...?

215
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:51,553
Oh, there she is.

216
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,749
Hey ! Hinata !

217
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,162
Naruto .

218
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:58,463
Naruto ...

219
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,132
Hinata, go out with me!

220
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:08,063
Wh What are you saying
at a time Iike this?!

221
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:09,641
Huh ?

222
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:15,509
I I don't know. . . Go out with you?

223
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:17,382
You won't?

224
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,484
I I'm not necessariIy saying no. . .

225
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:29,358
Then I'II just ask Neji then.
See you Iater!

226
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,029
What?

227
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:39,060
There's a thin thread attached
to the Paper Bomb .

228
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,538
A thread?

229
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:43,765
It's probabIy a speciaI thread
used to ignite it.

230
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,176
He's probabIy is going to detonate it
from a distance. . .

231
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,404
Where is that thread connected to?!

232
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,986
<i>lt goes around the classroom and</i>. . .

233
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,427
<i>lt goes outside</i>. . .
<i>towards the training hall</i>. . . <i>?</i>

234
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,837
<i>There's a log standing</i>. . .

235
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,075
This. . . CouId it be?!

236
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,073
Neji! Come with me for a second !

237
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,714
What is it!
We're in the middIe of something. . .

238
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,079
ActuaIIy there's a strange Iog standing
in the training haII over there.

239
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,684
We wanted him to check it.

240
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,517
That's the triggering device!

241
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,127
Huh ?

242
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:42,130
Try Ioosening up your shouIders
and then throw it.

243
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,158
Shut up.

244
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:46,703
AII right, I'm up next.

245
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,636
There shouId be a target on the Iog.

246
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,901
Yeah, there is.

247
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,372
The center of the target
is the triggering device!

248
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,947
When a Kunai Knife hits the center. . .

249
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,384
the device will activate...

250
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:03,443
And the Academy wiII expIode!

251
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,250
So cIose!

252
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:09,426
If you focus, you'II hit the target.

253
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:13,594
AII right, I'm going to hit this time.

254
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,596
Focus...

255
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,071
And target!

256
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,669
Don't let anybody hit the target !

257
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,588
AII right, I hit the target!

258
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,558
You did it!

259
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:43,728
Oh?

260
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:52,294
The tip is cracked.
You aIways have to take care of your tooIs.

261
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:55,836
Damn , I thought that I hit the target .

262
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,571
This way! Behind there!

263
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:02,978
AII right. . .
I'm going to hit it for sure!

264
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:04,507
That's the spirit!

265
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,211
This Iooks good!

266
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,649
This time I'm going to hit it!

267
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:13,725
Bushy Brow !

268
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,060
Stop it, Lee!

269
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,897
What?

270
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,528
Oh, did I scare you?

271
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:30,603
I'm sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tooI. . .
Here.

272
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,475
Bushy Brow , you did it !

273
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,582
I had the target!

274
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,448
Why did you get in the way?!

275
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,555
Be quiet!
If that had hit the target,

276
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,026
the Academy would have exploded!

277
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,728
What. . . ?

278
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,025
For real?

279
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,270
A triggering device in here. . . huh?

280
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,536
When something hits the center,
the Academy explodes.

281
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:12,079
So there hasn't been anyone
who's been abIe to hit the center.

282
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:14,813
We reaIIy were Iucky.

283
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,146
We were Iucky, huh?

284
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,625
So who started to practice
throwing their Kunai-Knife here?

285
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,560
Who? Who was it?

286
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,564
Somebody toId us that we'd be praised

287
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,194
if we got better at Kunai Knife throwing
in secret from the teachers.

288
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,701
" in secret from from the teachers. . . "

289
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:39,701
Whoever must've used Genjutsu
to make them think that .

290
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,439
It must be Genno.

291
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:49,621
What happened?

292
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:56,885
W Well. . . There's more than one thread
coming out of the triggering device.

293
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,288
Is that true Hinata?

294
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,232
Yeah. . .

295
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,070
Byakugan !

296
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:16,571
<i>True</i>.
<i>There's not just one</i>. . .<i>two</i>. . .<i>no, three?</i>

297
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:18,850
Where are they connected to?

298
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,046
Outside of the academy. . .
No!

299
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,850
Wait! It's hard to see from here.

300
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:30,857
U Umm. . . M Me too. . .

301
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,086
Byakugan !

302
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,454
Byakugan !

303
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:11,569
I found one.

304
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:18,810
I found one, too

305
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,478
TeII us the Iocation.

306
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:24,109
No, wait.
The thread spIits again.

307
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,054
Over here too. . .

308
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:44,196
Th This is. . .

309
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,535
No ...way ...

310
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,673
It can't be. . .

311
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,903
Hey ! What's the matter!

312
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:56,180
There's Paper Bombs pIanted
aII over the viIIage!

313
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,978
It's not just 1 0 or 20. . .

314
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,244
It's countIess numbers of them !

315
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,088
What?!

316
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:10,294
The ViIIage Hidden in the Leaves
is a nest of Paper Bombs!

317
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,826
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

318
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,329
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

319
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:50,835
<i>l just can't come out and say</i>,
<i>''Ah, l don't want to go home yet. "</i>

320
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:53,965
<i>Suggestively</i>

00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:58,772

00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:22,159
<i>l wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke l just drank?</i>

326
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,330
- Now, the Academy is safe.
- AII right!

327
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,093
It's too earIy to feeI reIieved.

328
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,828
If he reaIizes the Paper Bombs
are being deactivated,

329
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:59,496
he might bIow up the viIIage
by a different method.

330
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:01,797
Then we have to evacuate
everyone quickIy!

331
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:04,273
- Then he'II know what we're doing!
- That means. . .

332
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,641
Pretend we don't notice anything
and get rid of the Paper Bombs.

333
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:09,441
Everyone, get to it at once!

334
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,548
- Yeah!
- Yes.

335
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:14,448
