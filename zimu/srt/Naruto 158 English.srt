1
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:21,636
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:26,446
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:29,078
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,679
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:36,284
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:46,202
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:55,573
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:06,355
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:15,831
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:20,962
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:47,996
<i>Follow My Lead!</i>
<i>The Great Survival Challenge!</i>

12
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,901
I I'll do my best!

13
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,832
Looks like it'll be interesting,
huh, Konohamaru?!

14
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,071
Here... Here...

15
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:04,179
Heck no, heck no!
No way in heck, believe it!

16
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:12,582
Why should I have to do
some babysitting mission like that?

17
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:15,448
I don't care what you say,
Old Lady Tsunade. I refuse!

18
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:19,386
The team organization has already
been announced to the students!

19
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,423
I don't care about that!

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,661
As for me, I want to train more,
get stronger and...

21
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:28,433
"I'll become Hokage someday,
believe it," huh?

22
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,209
A person like that...

23
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:37,078
would never betray the expectations
of his adorable juniors, would he?

24
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,179
Become a unit leader and
issue appropriate instructions...

25
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:44,619
Protect the lives of your men
and promptly carry out your mission...

26
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,850
I thought this mission I'm giving you guys...

27
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:51,890
is ideal practice for becoming Hokage.

28
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,058
Ideal practice for becoming... Hokage?

29
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,965
If you're going so far as to say that,
then it can't be helped...

30
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,099
It's too bad...

31
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,469
Whoa! Kidding, kidding,
kidding, just kidding!

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,745
Say so sooner if that's the case.

33
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,508
Practice for becoming Hokage...

34
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,981
Yeah yeah...
That has a nice ring to it.

35
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,819
<i>He fell for it.</i>

36
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,987
<i>Jeez, he's nave...</i>

37
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:19,318
<i>Naruto...</i>

38
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,624
Now then,
my adorable team members... are...

39
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,363
<i>These guys...?</i>

40
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,511
Oh! Why the heck are you
on that side?!

41
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:46,683
Man, I don't want to do such
a troublesome mission either.

42
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,677
Shikamaru will be
an assistant to us instructors.

43
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,548
I will now begin the explanation
of the outdoor training

44
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,491
to be conducted over
one night and two days.

45
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,062
This is the spot you all
will be setting out for...

46
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,100
Great Stone Face of Warudakumi
on the summit of Mount Takurami.

47
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,334
The team leader will <i>not</i> take routes
other than the ones indicated on the map...

48
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:09,999
in order to ensure the safety
of the Academy students.

49
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:13,703
Along the way, there will be obstacles such
as instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,

50
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,473
as well as trap and the like.

51
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,877
But you Academy students
should be able to safely evade them

52
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,850
if you act according to the instructions
of your team leaders.

53
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,313
You'll see
the Stone Face of Warudakumi

54
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,290
after you cover about
eighty kilometers.

55
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,350
The team that brings the secret document
hidden there back to the village...

56
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:34,398
will have completed the training
upon crossing the finish line.

57
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,828
There is only one secret document.

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,960
This will be a competition
with the other teams.

59
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:43,365
All right.
We'll finish first, no matter what!

60
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,902
You guys ready?!

61
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,136
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

62
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:57,878
An important thing about survival is
acquiring food with your own resources...

63
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:03,124
This is called Beef Sashimi Grass
and it grows in this area...

64
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,892
You can eat it raw and

65
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,261
it becomes precious food
when the chips are down...

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,495
- Wow!
- Wow!

67
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,698
All right! All members acquire food!

68
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,170
- Yay!
- Yay!

69
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,304
This is it!

70
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's eat...

71
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,542
That's a Blowfish Sashimi Grass.
It's a very similar poisonous grass.

72
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:31,010
See? The shape of the leaf
is a bit different, right...?

73
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,018
You two be careful as well, okay?

74
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,254
- Okay!
- Okay!

75
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:46,668
Listen up, an important thing in survival
is to acquire food by your own resources.

76
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,703
Something's not right!

77
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,770
Disappointing, isn't it?

78
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:55,273
I've got an uneasy feeling...

79
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:01,417
Let's see...

80
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,421
The geography in this area
throws magnets out of kilter...

81
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,556
When you can't use a compass...

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:07,916
Huh?

83
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,488
You're wearing a watch, right?

84
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,726
Oh... yes!

85
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,457
Look for the bisecting angle,

86
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:18,969
which divides the 12:00 direction and the
current direction of the hour hand in two...

87
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:23,198
And then, when you line up that direction
with the sun as of now...

88
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,641
the approximate 12:00 direction is south.

89
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:28,938
Remember that!

90
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,409
- Okay!
- Okay!

91
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,949
Let's... see...

92
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,455
Huh? This way?

93
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,185
Hey, Konohamaru...

94
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,024
This way?

95
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,723
No doubt about it...

96
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,831
He's totally lost...

97
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,461
Right, right!

98
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:53,661
<i>Yikes...This is bad, believe it.</i>

99
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,969
A All right! This way!

100
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:58,174
Come with me, believe it!

101
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:00,037
Will it be okay?

102
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,216
That was a more challenging route
than I thought, wasn't it, guys?

103
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,521
Challenging, my foot!
We're back at where we came from!

104
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,858
Man, we can't trust you,
Brother Naruto!

105
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,529
Then why don't you try?!

106
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,329
Give me that!

107
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,036
Oh... It's this way.

108
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:31,605
N Not bad...

109
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,303
What's the matter, Konohamaru?!

110
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:39,510
What're you doing, Konohamaru?!
Give me that!

111
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,916
Sorry... Here.

112
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:44,781
Let me see...

113
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,448
Oh, it's that way!

114
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,126
What were you guys doing?!

115
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,121
Hey, we've come back again!

116
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:59,099
What...? How in the world can
we get out of here?!

117
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,997
All right... I'll do my best!

118
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,046
I don't feel good...

119
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:15,978
Hey!

120
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,279
Good grief...

121
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,368
Are you guys okay?

122
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,164
- Yes, Lee Sensei!
- Yes, Lee Sensei!

123
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,670
What did you say... just now?!

124
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,432
- Yes, Lee Sensei!
- Yes, Lee Sensei!

125
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,841
Lee Sensei...!
Ahh, that has such a lovely ring to it.

126
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:46,173
This is youth, this is extreme youth!

127
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:49,185
Now, run towards that setting sun!

128
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,811
- Yes, Lee Sensei!
- Yes, Lee Sensei!

129
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:54,289
Your sweat sparkling in
the setting sun is wonderful!

130
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:55,985
- Yes, Lee Sensei!
- Yes, Lee Sensei!

131
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,028
Finally made it, huh?

132
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,237
Now, I guess I'll check out
Naruto's team in action.

133
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,504
Now then... Show me what
you've learned until now!

134
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:15,809
Go!

135
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,373
All right! Formation One, Konohamaru!

136
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,083
<i>Sexy Jutsu!</i>

137
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,847
Adults are a cinch with this Jutsu.

138
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:26,987
You idiot!

139
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,923
You wish, Brother Naruto!

140
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,025
Times are evolving!

141
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,190
New formation!

142
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,658
- Cheesecake Jutsu!
- Cheesecake Jutsu!

143
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,135
Fashion Model!

144
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,042
Movie Star!

145
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,144
Tanning Salon Receptionist!

146
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,041
- We're Cheesecakes!
- We're Cheesecakes!

147
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,547
I'd like to say, just what
I'd expect of my best pupils,

148
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,217
but you still don't have
enough "bust waist hip."

149
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:08,254
Jeez... This guy's such a pain...
as always.

150
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,970
Iruka Sensei!

151
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,409
What is it?

152
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,607
A report from the observatory...

153
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:33,452
Wow... It's warm...

154
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,991
Good thing we listened to you
and prepared it ahead of time.

155
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,555
We would've been soaked if

156
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,961
we were even a little slow
putting up the tent!

157
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,657
Reading ahead is important for
a Ninja...

158
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,902
In particular, if you don't acutely
sense the weatherr,

159
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,700
it could end up being fatal,
so be careful.

160
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:50,167
- Okay!
- Okay!

161
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:57,806
What're you doing, Moegi?
Pull it properly, believe it!

162
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,841
I've had it!
I don't want to do this!

163
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,888
Moegi! Stop saying selfish things
and hold it!

164
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:05,650
But...

165
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,295
What, really?!

166
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,666
It seems it's going to directly hit
the Leaf Village before dawn...

167
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,664
Jeez, why now...?!

168
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,065
The communication from
the observatory

169
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,128
was probably delayed due to the storm.

170
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:23,630
We have no choice, then...

171
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:25,708
The training is suspended.

172
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,104
Convey the order to all
the teams immediately!

173
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:28,838
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

174
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:34,344
Why'd you put the tent away?!

175
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,119
Brother Naruto, what's the deal?

176
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,421
This path isn't on the map.

177
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,087
We fell behind the others more
than I thought.

178
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,521
We can't be resting

179
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,322
Then, this path...

180
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:53,168
Yeah... It's not on the map.
It's a shortcut route!

181
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,395
- What?!
- What?!

182
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,431
Will this be okay?!

183
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,682
What're you doing?!
We'll be late if we don't hurry!

184
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:12,478
Don't talk nonsense!

185
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:15,421
We haven't learned that method
of climbing!

186
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,657
Right! Chakra control comes after
we've become senior students!

187
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,856
That makes no difference.
You can do anything if you get serious!

188
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,297
Come on! Let's go!

189
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,601
Damn it...!

190
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,701
Grab on!

191
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,441
Wh What're you doing?!

192
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,679
Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!

193
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,846
If I let go, he'll blow away!

194
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,355
Let go of the bag, Udon!

195
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,921
I I can't...!

196
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,851
It can't be helped...

197
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,590
No! I can't hold on any longer!

198
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:01,232
That was a close one!

199
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,171
I issued an evacuation advisory

200
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,868
to all the teams encamped
at the foot of the mountain.

201
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:09,508
I see... Now all that's left is
Naruto's team...

202
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:10,611
Iruka Sensei!

203
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,277
I found this on an unplanned route...

204
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,512
An unplanned route, you say?!

205
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:25,324
What do we do now?
We've lost our tent and our food...

206
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:28,058
There's no point in saying that!

207
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:32,259
What?! It's because you put your foot
on my backpack in the first place...

208
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,427
What're you talking about?!

209
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,596
If my foot hadn't gotten caught,
we would've blown away.

210
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:38,367
Now, now...
Stop fighting, believe it.

211
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,940
Why didn't you close the zipper, Udon?!

212
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,743
Sorry...

213
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:46,146
Now, now...
Don't say that, Konohamaru!

214
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,343
When you get right down to it,

215
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:50,387
it's your fault for entering a strange route,
Brother Naruto!

216
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:51,880
Right, right!

217
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:52,819
What?

218
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,050
We got behind because

219
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,526
you got caught in a trap
and were lost forever!

220
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,892
Hey, what did you say?!

221
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,794
You can't justify yourself, can you?!

222
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,561
We could've gotten through faster
if you guys hadn't gotten in the way!

223
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,862
It's because our leader's
not dependable!

224
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,403
What?!

225
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,470
Heh! How silly!

226
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,503
- What did you say?!
- What did you say?!

227
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:11,504
What?!

228
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:18,409
Ohh... I'm hungry...
Temporary ceasefire.

229
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:25,889
This is the spot.

230
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:28,581
<i>That Naruto...</i>

231
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:31,451
<i>After all I told him about</i>
<i>following instructions!</i>

232
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:33,821
Taking the direction of the wind
under consideration,

233
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:34,956
they're above here, I guess...

234
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,566
Okay, let's go, Shikamaru.

235
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:37,259
Right.

236
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:40,936
What's this?!

237
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:44,070
It's all stuff we need hot water for...

238
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:47,110
About the only thing we can eat
is the baumkuchen cake...

239
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,811
I'm hungry...

240
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,977
You're asking too much!

241
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:52,512
This is survival,

242
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,450
so it's common sense to have things ready
that can be eaten right away!

243
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,979
Right, right!

244
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,485
I won't share if you're going to complain!

245
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:06,029
<i>I'm taking the big one.</i>

246
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:09,195
<i>The biggest one...is mine!</i>

247
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,865
<i>The big one... The big one...</i>

248
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:18,600
Okay, eat up!

249
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,740
What...? But...

250
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,004
It's divided in three?

251
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,682
You're not having any here,
Brother Naruto?

252
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,140
Back in the day,

253
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,120
I also went without food once
when I screwed up during training.

254
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:36,726
We couldn't all pull together
and Kakashi Sensei got mad at us...

255
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:41,226
Cripes! <i>Who cares about</i>
<i>three working as one?!</i>

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,094
<i>It's called teamwork.</i>

257
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,628
I figured it out at that time.

258
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:51,702
The important thing for
a Ninja isn't rules or codes,

259
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,137
but teamwork acting for
the sake of comrades...

260
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:55,410
<i>Here.</i>

261
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,248
<i>Sakura...</i>

262
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:06,815
Brother Naruto...

263
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,459
Well as for me,
I don't like sweets, so!

264
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:13,554
- Oh...
- Oh...

265
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:16,963
You're one to talk
having bought it yourself!

266
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,964
Your stomach growled.

267
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:21,262
You have some too, Brother Naruto!

268
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,211
It's pretty slippery.
You okay, Shikamaru?

269
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:30,973
Yeah...

270
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:34,980
<i>Damn it... How could that Naruto</i>
<i>take such a dangerous route?!</i>

271
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,455
<i>Jeez... He's always causing</i>
<i>some kind of trouble.</i>

272
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:39,954
<i>What a pain he is...</i>

273
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,328
It seems they were here
until just a little while ago...

274
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:56,135
He really does cause... trouble.

275
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:58,938
The finish line is right
before our eyes!

276
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,771
That method of climbing isn't fair,
I tell you!

277
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,008
Right! I knew we shouldn't have
shared the food!

278
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,785
What is it, Udon?

279
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,843
What're you doing?
We'll leave you behind!

280
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:14,223
Something's... coming...

281
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:21,661
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

282
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,862
R-Run while you can!

283
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,174
G Got it!

284
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,968
H-Hurry it up...

285
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,872
Brother Naruto!

286
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,649
- Brother Naruto!
- Brother Naruto!

287
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,257
Brother! Brother Naruto!
Hang in there!

288
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,728
What should we do, Konohamaru?!

289
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,454
We'll go help him...

290
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,226
But... it looks like
it'll crumble again!

291
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,699
Brother Naruto!
Let's go, Udon, Moegi!

292
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,343
Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!

293
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,447
That was close. So I made it into
a space between the rocks, huh...?

294
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,252
We're coming to help!

295
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:23,987
Idiot! Run, quick!

296
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,820
Konohamaru...

297
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:28,224
We can't do it...
Let's call for help

298
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,163
Brother said it before!

299
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,561
The important thing for
a Ninja is teamwork!

300
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:36,262
Konohamaru, you...

301
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:40,273
No! If I move even a little,
the support rock will give way

302
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:42,244
and you guys will end up
getting entangled in this!

303
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:46,138
Brother Naruto! Have you forgotten
what you yourself said?

304
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,848
You can do anything...

305
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,746
...if you get serious!

306
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,048
You guys...

307
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,319
Konohamaru Gang!
Help Brother Naruto!

308
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,552
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

309
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,362
Be careful!

310
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,503
Easy does it!

311
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,437
Yeah.

312
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,074
But hurry.

313
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,086
It moved... Time it right and
toss it away in one shot.

314
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:25,086
Got it!

315
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,415
One, two...!

316
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,316
Yes!

317
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:30,758
It's a big success!

318
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:32,828
We did it, we did it!

319
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,460
That was a close one...

320
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:37,761
- Naruto!
- Naruto!

321
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:39,929
You guys okay?

322
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,772
Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!

323
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:44,538
Naruto! Above you!

324
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:49,702
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

325
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,377
Run towards Shikamaru!

326
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:02,081
- Brother Naruto!
- Brother Naruto!

327
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,284
Naruto!

328
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,788
Rasengan!

329
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,528
Naruto...

330
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,570
Man, making us get all nervous...

331
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,100
Excellent, Brother Naruto...

332
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,845
Thank goodness!

333
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:23,707
Yeah!

334
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:31,015
So, what's the meaning of this?

335
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:32,978
So you see...

336
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,216
It was all Brother Naruto's orders!

337
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:37,457
We were opposed,

338
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:40,630
but he forced us to move ahead
saying the only way to finish first

339
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,756
was to take a dangerous shortcut!

340
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,400
I said many times we shouldn't
because it's dangerous!

341
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,659
But...

342
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:51,432
- Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
- Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!

343
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,370
What...? What?

344
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:58,508
It seems that's about the size of it...
You're prepared, right, Naruto?

345
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,841
Say...

346
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,051
Since when did your teamwork
get so good?

347
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,151
Naruto!

348
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,819
I've had it with lectures!

349
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,821
Hey, wait! Naruto!

350
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,859
Wait!

351
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:41,651
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

352
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:53,229
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

353
00:21:53,971 --> 00:22:04,540
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

354
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:16,725
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

355
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:28,168
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

356
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:39,714
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

<i>I'll be close to you</i>

00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:54,627
Across the verdant wild
came the slender giant!

359
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,494
Equipped with two wakizashi,
a wandering bounty hunter!

360
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:02,401
The target is Gosunkugi,
the villainous thief!

361
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:05,939
A fierce battle of hunt and be hunted!
Then comes the voice to halt the action!

362
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,774
Hey, hey, hey!
That bastard thief is mine!

363
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,073
Enter Naruto Uzumaki!

364
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,786
Next time:
"The Bounty Hunter from the Wilderness"
