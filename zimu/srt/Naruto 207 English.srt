1
00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:13,987
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:33,741
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,612
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,713
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:51,318
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:04,974
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:17,613
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:24,022
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:29,225
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:46,649
Kiba!

12
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:50,953
Naruto!

13
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,349
You okay, Kiba?

14
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:57,181
Yeah...

15
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,358
Is this also Genjutsu...?!

16
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:04,059
No one, including Akamaru,
can escape from Yakumo's Genjutsu.

17
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,193
It's because...

18
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,602
we have an enlarged neural tube...
the cerebrum...

19
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,105
Guys, move away from the door!

20
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:15,478
Parasitic Insects.

21
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:33,258
Please, Sensei...
Tell me the truth.

22
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,297
If you don't... I'll rub you out...

23
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,868
I reached the decision
to seal your Genjutsu power

24
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,699
at my own discretion.

25
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,666
It has nothing to do with
the Third Hokage...

26
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,576
Vent your resentment...

27
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:57,178
The only one you should hate is me...

28
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,585
I heard...!

29
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,457
I heard you and
the Third Hokage talking

30
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,993
about trying to destroy
the Kurama Clan!

31
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:09,895
Yakumo, you've got the wrong idea.

32
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,200
You lie!

33
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:15,063
No way could my mother
and father die in just a fire!

34
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:25,307
My parents were killed...!

35
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,318
What?!

36
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:36,459
Shino...

37
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,029
What's this?!

38
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:45,394
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

39
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:48,504
All right!

40
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:50,128
I'm counting on you guys!

41
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,307
- Right!
- Right!

42
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,473
Now, I'm ready when you are...

43
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,273
One, two...

44
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,241
Charge!

45
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,112
Go!

46
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,454
N -Naruto...

47
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:16,999
Naruto?!

48
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,962
Kurenai Sensei!
What happened to your...?

49
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:24,072
Yakumo, did you do this...?

50
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:27,737
That person tried to eliminate me...

51
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,671
So she's just facing the consequences.

52
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:31,278
You're wrong!

53
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,075
Yakumo, you've
misunderstood something.

54
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:42,652
I heard everything about you and
Kurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.

55
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,714
Stop, Naruto!

56
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:48,186
Listen up.
Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers

57
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:51,324
because she cares about you!

58
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,299
What're you talking about?!

59
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,797
You're not the only one who's suffering!

60
00:04:56,172 --> 00:05:01,474
Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all
this time and has suffered alone!

61
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,812
Stop!

62
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:07,880
The... truth...?

63
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:13,186
<i>The Supposed Sealed Ability</i>

64
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,124
Guy Sensei!

65
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,390
Hey, where is everyone?!

66
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,732
Shino and Hinata are standing
watch in the hallway,

67
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:30,568
but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,938
are now inside the world
created by Yakumo's Genjutsu!

69
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:35,506
Huh? What do you mean?!

70
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:37,477
I'll explain...

71
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,708
Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.

72
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:43,851
No... I must now
explain the truth...

73
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:49,089
Nobody has taken such affectionate care
of Yakumo as Kurenai.

74
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:55,058
Kurenai's resolve was to get Yakumo
to give up on being a Shinobi...

75
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:00,594
Yakumo was completely in low spirits.

76
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:04,369
Lord Murakumo was also concerned...

77
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,667
Then one day, that incident occurred...

78
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:14,348
The residence of the head family
burned to the ground

79
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,386
and Yakumo stood motionless
in front of it...

80
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,289
I saw it at that time...

81
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:25,391
The form of a monster with
a face like a female demon

82
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,520
hovering in the flames...!

83
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:37,400
After learning of its identity...
I became frozen with terror.

84
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:47,007
What is... the truth?!

85
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:51,086
Sensei... What the heck is happening
to Yakumo?

86
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,288
This is bad...!

87
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,646
Yakumo! You don't know...

88
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,219
You don't know anything!

89
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,866
Something's... Yes...

90
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:12,166
There is something...
in the recesses of my mind...

91
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:15,711
But... What is it...?
I can't remember...

92
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,070
Oh no...!

93
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:20,913
Naruto, stop that!

94
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,284
Huh?!

95
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:24,720
Naruto!

96
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:28,687
What is this thing?!
Damn it. Let me go!

97
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:52,173
All I want to do is live up to
everyone's expectations, and yours.

98
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,410
And yet...
Why does everyone get in my way?

99
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:01,316
I just want to become a Genjutsu user...

100
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,654
People have their respective
appropriate paths.

101
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,621
You probably have your own path.

102
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,897
That's right...

103
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:12,124
There's no need to force yourself
to become a Shinobi...

104
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,103
No... I don't want that!

105
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,333
Everyone may comfort me with words...

106
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,669
But I know.
I know they're disappointed in me.

107
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:26,113
I can't stand having to live
my whole life feeling that burden.

108
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,454
Yakumo, what's that...?

109
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,049
R-Run, Uroko!

110
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:54,006
Yakumo!

111
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:08,815
I remember...

112
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:10,859
Yakumo...?!

113
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,695
Yes... me...

114
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,956
The person inside me killed
my mother and father...!

115
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,796
I killed them with Genjutsu!

116
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:25,030
No, Yakumo!
That wasn't you...

117
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:28,500
You and that monster are different!

118
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,176
No, we're not different...

119
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:36,785
You see, that thing...
was living inside my heart.

120
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,525
Thanks... Kurenai Sensei...

121
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,524
Goodbye...

122
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,132
Stop!

123
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:52,696
Yakumo!

124
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,751
Wh What's... that...?!

125
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:18,690
In order for us to get
a clear picture of the incident,

126
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,821
we first requested
a complete examination of Yakumo...

127
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:30,863
As a result, we learned the monster
that appeared at the time of the fire

128
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,106
was an Id Monster so to speak,
created by Yakumo's sub consciousness.

129
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,047
An Id... Monster...

130
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,912
Then I made a direct appeal
to the Third Hokage...

131
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:52,191
Ultimately, Yakumo could
not endure the weight

132
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:56,789
of living up to our expectations
from the time she was little

133
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,664
and that triggered her sub-consciousness
to attempt to expunge everything.

134
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:04,900
Yakumo's sub consciousness
will probably attempt to

135
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:11,402
expunge the Kurama Clan
and eventually the entire Leaf Village.

136
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:13,446
I cannot consent to that...

137
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,814
Despite such a risk,

138
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:23,223
taking the life of Yakumo who has
no awareness of evil cannot be allowed!

139
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:25,654
It'll be too late

140
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,697
once her sub consciousness
completely awakens!

141
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:34,497
Then we just have to get her
to learn how to control it herself...

142
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,507
or seal her powers if that's not possible.

143
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,509
But...

144
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,302
Although slightly different
from Yakumo's case...

145
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:50,385
There's a precedent of a baby being used
to seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.

146
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:51,920
That's absurd...!

147
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,250
There isn't a Jutsu practitioner

148
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,883
who can seal the strong powers
Yakumo possesses...

149
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,756
There might be just one person
who can accomplish that...

150
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,363
However, it will become
a painful mission.

151
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:09,999
Hopefully, this person can teach her
how to control her powers...

152
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,604
But if it comes to sealing her powers,

153
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:16,338
the Jutsu practitioner will end up
erasing all the potential in the child...

154
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,915
The Jutsu practitioner will
have to live with the burden

155
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:23,440
of Yakumo's resentment
in place of the Kurama Clan...

156
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,115
The Third Hokage said that
and then cried.

157
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,528
The one who accepted that
painful mission was...

158
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,158
Yuhi Kurenai.

159
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,635
I see...

160
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,632
So that's what Kurenai Sensei
was talking about.

161
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:46,701
I... didn't know anything about Sensei...

162
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:52,074
I knew that Kurenai had sealed
Yakumo's powers...

163
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,549
But it's the first time I've heard

164
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:55,914
about the incident
her sub consciousness caused.

165
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,216
Yes... The Third Hokage passed away

166
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:04,020
and at this point, it's a secret known only
to the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.

167
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:09,160
She made herself into the bad guy
and kept the secret, huh...?

168
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,966
Kurenai Sensei...!

169
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,064
You go, too!

170
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:15,765
- But...
- Sakura...

171
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,897
I'll take over things here...!

172
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,698
Guy Sensei...

173
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:22,343
You're concerned about Naruto
and the others, right?

174
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:24,379
Go to them...!

175
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:25,714
Right!

176
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,348
I leave Yakumo... to you...

177
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:39,194
What is it...?

178
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,725
I don't know... But...

179
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,398
This feeling...

180
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,633
It's somehow
entirely different from before...

181
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,336
My insects are acting strange.

182
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:56,840
What's going on inside?!
Is Kurenai Sensei okay?

183
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:00,916
It's powerful...

184
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:05,420
A massive Chakra beyond compare
is being produced...!

185
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:09,458
<i>Naruto...</i>

186
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:26,164
Why? Why do you have
to take your own life?

187
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,509
What...?!

188
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,908
What must be destroyed are the ones

189
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,846
who forced you to shoulder
a heavy burden

190
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:37,784
and on top of that,
tried to eliminate me!

191
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,287
Who're you...?

192
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:46,926
I crept into an opening in the depths
of your mind and was nurtured.

193
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,731
My name is Id...!

194
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,881
She's finally awoken...

195
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,809
Kurenai Sensei,
what is that thing?

196
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:15,021
It happened soon after I was made
Yakumo's personal instructor.

197
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:21,091
It was when I had doubts about
the high level of Yakumo's Genjutsu

198
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,723
and looked into her deep psyche.

199
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,293
I discovered that thing!

200
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:57,859
I could only stand motionless
in front of that terrible figure.

201
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,668
It wasn't Yakumo whom
the Third Hokage said to eliminate...

202
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,638
It was her Id monster...

203
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:08,876
So that's what it was...?

204
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,906
This ominous ghastliness...
is more powerful than before.

205
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,609
But I must stop it from getting
into the real world,

206
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,175
even if we have to kill each other...!

207
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:21,186
<i>Kill each other?!</i>
<i>I see...</i>

208
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,014
<i>She was that determined...</i>

209
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,323
<i>So that's why she quit Squad Eight.</i>

210
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:31,792
I'll take your feelings into this body
and settle the score...

211
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,934
You jerk!

212
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,477
You're in the way. Move it!

213
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:48,984
Naruto!

214
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:57,290
I don't know
what the heck you are...

215
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,320
But Kiba, Shino, Hinata,
they're all waiting for Sensei's return!

216
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,399
Naruto!

217
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,991
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

218
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:11,034
My Jutsu won't activate in this world...!

219
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:16,005
You are a thorn in my side...
I'll erase you first.

220
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,314
Look out!

221
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:23,613
Yakumo, you're the only one
who can defeat it now!

222
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:24,986
What...?

223
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,581
Listen, Yakumo... All people have
a fanged beast in their minds...

224
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,561
It always lives in the depths of
a person's mind

225
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,393
and will suddenly appear.

226
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,164
The power of the beast that
appears is enormous and

227
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:46,197
regardless of one's own will,
it can inadvertently hurt those around it.

228
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:51,479
But... if that monster can be tamed

229
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:53,674
and then controlled
with one's own power...

230
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,910
It becomes a magnificent power

231
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,482
and acts to make
your dreams come true.

232
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,559
Now, fight!

233
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:09,356
A bate by your own hand
the monster you created!

234
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,526
B-But...

235
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,665
Yakumo, only you can do this!

236
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,542
Die, boy...

237
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,409
Darkness in my mind, abate!

238
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,312
Die!

239
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:48,661
Why...?
I... served... you well...

240
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:12,022
Kurenai Sensei,
you're back to normal!

241
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:18,061
Kurenai... Sensei...

242
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:24,504
You did well, Yakumo...
You defeated your own darkness.

243
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:27,332
Sensei...

244
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,374
You did it, Yakumo...

245
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,408
<i>Yakumo...</i>

246
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:07,874
<i>She knew exactly who was</i>
<i>really trying to save her...</i>

247
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,009
- Kurenai Sensei!
- Sensei...

248
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,288
It's okay now!

249
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,148
Kurenai Sensei...

250
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,221
You'll go back to being
everyone's teacher, right?

251
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:21,262
That's right...

252
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:25,291
My final mission from
the Third Hokage is over...

253
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,235
- Sensei!
- Sensei!

254
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:33,100
That's great that things could
get back to normal...

255
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:34,676
Sakura...!

256
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:06,875
<i>Naruto...?</i>

257
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:09,511
<i>I will too.</i>

258
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:23,622
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

259
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:29,961
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

260
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:39,771
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

261
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:44,370
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

262
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:49,315
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

263
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:54,185
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

264
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:59,159
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

265
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:03,392
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

266
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:07,868
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

267
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:15,274
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

268
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:19,178
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

269
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:24,447
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

270
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,581
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

271
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:33,458
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

272
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:38,155
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

273
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:44,297
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

274
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:52,239
This isn't funny!

275
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:54,874
Why do we have to get all worn out
for someone like him?

276
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,043
Exactly! We were told to protect
the Beauty of Nature,

277
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,643
but he keeps getting in our way.
Is this some kind of joke?

278
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,154
Plus, he uses people as scapegoats
and shields.

279
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,953
He thinks it's only natural for
Shinobi to die in missions.

280
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,687
I can't take this anymore!

281
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,251
Me neither.
If it comes to this, then I'm...

282
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,853
...gonna use Rasengan!
...gonna use Gatsuuga!

283
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:12,224
- And beat up this client up so bad!
- And beat up this client up so bad!

284
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,092
Next time:
"The Weight of The Prized A rtifact!"
