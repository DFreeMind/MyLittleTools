00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,728
Kuchiyose-no-jutsu
(Summon Technique)

3
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:09,553
This time it should be a frog for sure.

4
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:24,538
What is a frog anyways?

5
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:26,834
From what point is it called a frog?!

6
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,695
Alive or Dead!? Risking life for learning a Jutsu!

7
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,159
Hey!

8
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,125
Can't you even be a little bit helpful?!

9
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,449
He's passed out again.

10
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,787
It's to be expected...

11
00:02:57,788 --> 00:03:03,684
He's been training only with his guts for the last three weeks.

12
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:31,092
Hokage-sama...

13
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,025
That you Anko?

14
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,078
I'm sorry...

15
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,497
I...

16
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,052
You regret that you came back alive from the Forest of Death?

17
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:48,888
Am I right?

18
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,207
It's needless to worry...

19
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,925
Orochimaru and you have no more relations.

20
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:08,415
There's no ninja in Konoha who can match up with him.

21
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:16,129
I'm afraid that even I... won't be able to.

22
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,798
If the Fourth was still alive...

23
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,641
Don't say that to him...

24
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,957
He already died to save this village.

25
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:33,718
It's already been 13-years.

26
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:36,416
He's not here anymore.

27
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,731
We have to do something with our own power.

28
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,748
Yes.

29
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,862
I'm going outside to get some fresh air.

30
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,783
Don't blame yourself... Ok?

31
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,082
Hey!

32
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,993
Wake up already!

33
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,003
What?

34
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:21,673
To be honest, you've got zero talent.

35
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,172
Ero Sennin!

36
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,622
It's a waste of time if you are only at...

37
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,206
this level after three weeks of training.

38
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,368
That won't be true.

39
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,519
I'm doing my best even though it may not seem like it.

40
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,203
I know that.

41
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,486
But if you really want to
do the Kuchiyose-no-jutsu...

42
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:41,253
you need to do it with your life on the line.

43
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,974
I'm doing that!

44
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,578
I've been channeling chakra with my life on the line!

45
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,155
If you talk like that, give me one trick to do this!

46
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,014
A Trick?

47
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,133
The trick is...

48
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,200
Are you gonna tell me one?

49
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,923
It's to risk your life.

50
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,844
My life?

51
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:00,515
It's not a joke.

52
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,673
Do you still want to do it?

53
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,106
Of course!

54
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,346
I always risk my life!

55
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,451
I see.

56
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:13,200
Then, follow me.

57
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,998
What are we going to do at a place like this?

58
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,093
Don't tell me you're going to peek again.

59
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, that may be good.

60
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,182
But we're going to bathe today.

61
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:41,091
We need to purify our bodies first.

62
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:42,925
Huh?

63
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,795
Something strange is going on here...

64
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,368
The hot water feels so nice!

65
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:01,106
So nice!

66
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:06,184
This is heaven!

67
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,148
Hey Ero Sennin...

68
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,836
It's Gama Sennin (Toad Sennin)

69
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,680
I don't care which...

70
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,887
But what's the relationship between...

71
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,735
taking a bath and doing Kuchiyose?

72
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:22,416
Hey!

73
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,620
Hey! Hey! Hey!

74
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,160
What is it?

75
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,702
Hey, Naruto.

76
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:34,181
Do you have something you want to eat?

77
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,162
Itadakimasu!

78
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,034
So tasty!

79
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:46,697
If training is like this, I can do it everyday!

80
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,439
Eat up.

81
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,153
Because this will be the last...

82
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,154
Huh?

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,755
Oh, Nothing...

84
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,397
Eat up... eat more!

85
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,989
Eat like you won't have anything to regret.

86
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:03,377
I don't get it, but all I need to do is to eat, right?

87
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:04,378
Ok, then...

88
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,891
Another bowl. Miso again!

89
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:15,578
Alright.

90
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,169
Another one!

91
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:21,221
Alright.

92
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:23,209
Miso Chashu again.

93
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,065
I'm so stuffed!

94
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,397
Thank you Ero Sennin...

95
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,761
What?!

96
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,494
Thank you!

97
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,666
Can't squeeze even a drop of blood...

98
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:47,969
Hey!

99
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,970
Are you full?

100
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,011
Don't mess with me Ero Sennin!

101
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,970
Weren't you supposed to treat me there?

102
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:57,384
Stupid.

103
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,384
Who said I would treat you?

104
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,243
Are you a grown up talking to me like that?

105
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:03,639
By the way, Naruto.

106
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,892
Do you have somebody in your mind?

107
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,893
Huh?

108
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,915
I'm asking if you have a lovely girl you like.

109
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:14,235
Well, I could say I like...

110
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,447
I have somebody...

111
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:17,231
So you have someone?

112
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,263
It's Sakura-chan!

113
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:20,057
Great!

114
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:24,211
Then immediately go hug that girl tightly!

115
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,876
Is that part of my training?

116
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:31,375
Yeah, it's something like that.

117
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,703
Alright!

118
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,608
Then I'll go right now!

119
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:38,386
But if I do such a thing, Sakura-chan would...

120
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:39,142
No!

121
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,964
This is training!

122
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,406
If I don't, I can't be strong!

123
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:46,909
But if I do such a thing, Sakura-chan...

124
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,609
won't talk to me for a while afterwards.

125
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:50,395
No!

126
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,642
In order to do the
Kuchiyose-no-Jutsu...

127
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,444
this is a task I have to do!

128
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,062
But Sakura-chan...

129
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:58,247
No!

130
00:09:59,024 --> 00:09:59,801
But...

131
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,417
Go already!

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,335
What do you want?

133
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,735
Well... ah...

134
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,286
I won't lend you any money.

135
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:17,036
I'm greedy despite how I look like.

136
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:20,462
It's not that... well....

137
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:26,834
She'll definitely punch me if I ask to hug her for my training.

138
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,002
I'm going if you don't have anything to tell me.

139
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,435
Hey, wait a second!

140
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:38,166
This is my chance!

141
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,952
Sorry, Sakura-chan!

142
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,135
What are you trying to do to me!

143
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,911
Goddamnit!

144
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:57,443
That really hurt.

145
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,423
This is an incident of youthful days.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,581
Hey...

147
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,869
Is a frog actually coming out doing things like this?

148
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,548
Yeah, that's for sure.

149
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,367
Really?

150
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,719
Is there nothing you will reget anymore?

151
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:20,430
Huh?

152
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,588
Is there?

153
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:24,554
What are you talking...

154
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:38,088
To pull out and use a large amount of chakra...

155
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:40,342
it sure is hard just to control it.

156
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:47,108
Also his body is too small to accept Kyubi's chakra.

157
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,813
I suppose his body normally refuses the...

158
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:53,320
Kyubi's chakra to avoid the extra burden.

159
00:11:55,697 --> 00:12:00,263
If the key to pull out Kyubi's chakra is to risk his life...

160
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:04,236
then I need to have him learn how to use the key with his body.

161
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,605
Don't hold a grudge...

162
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:08,183
Fourth Hokage.

163
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,250
Huh?

164
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:27,481
Where is this place?

165
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,382
Stand up!

166
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,366
What?

167
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,153
Your training is to end now.

168
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,800
You haven't done anything yet!

169
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,798
Naruto!

170
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,884
Go die from now.

171
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,718
Die?

172
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:46,219
Try pulling out the big chakra from the fear of the death.

173
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,829
And experience it with your body and get the trick.

174
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,965
If you don't want to die, do something by yourself. OK?

175
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:17,892
Show me whether the power given to you is really for you.

176
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,108
If I don't grab it...

177
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,023
I'll die!

178
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:30,682
Now!

179
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:36,642
It's useless.

180
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:40,537
The cliff is slippery because of the water from the water fall.

181
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,890
Also, falling down with that speed...

182
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:47,490
it's impossible to stick to the rocks with your chakra control.

183
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,053
Naruto...

184
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,797
Only one thing is left to depend on the Kyubi's chakra.

185
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,794
Open the key...

186
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,205
this time you're the one commanding it.

187
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:01,669
If it's like this...

188
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,115
like this...

189
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:04,556
I'll really die!

190
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:08,815
I'll die.

191
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:12,923
I'll die.

192
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,752
Today, it's History class outside.

193
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,658
As you know already...

194
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,287
those faces on the cliff are successive Hokage's faces.

195
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:32,220
From the left, the First...

196
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:34,460
the Second...

197
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:36,851
the Third...

198
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:39,019
and the Fourth.

199
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:45,567
There's a big difference between that and the old man now.

200
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,403
Especially the hair-line.

201
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:51,852
Iruka sensi!

202
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,296
Who'll be the Fifth?

203
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,588
It's not decided yet but...

204
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,056
most likely it will your teacher, me!

205
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:08,996
You're holding a class with some jokes, Iruka.

206
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,858
Hokage-sama.

207
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,016
It's the Third!

208
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,198
Hey, Old man!

209
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,812
What did you come here for?

210
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,343
I wanted to see those rock faces.

211
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,400
You came here at good time.

212
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,115
Please come here.

213
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:34,621
This person is the real one for the third face on the cliff,

214
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,917
The Third Hokage.

215
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,956
People said he was the strongest of all the Hokage...

216
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:44,630
and they called him the genius Professor.

217
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,204
Hey, Iruka.

218
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,198
Don't talk in the past tense.

219
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,903
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,464
Are you really that strong?

221
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,148
You don't seem like it.

222
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,442
Yup, I agree.

223
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,268
Hey!

224
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,969
To recieve the name Hokage means...

225
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,102
he is the #1 strongest in this village.

226
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:05,923
Alright.

227
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,761
Then I'll become the fifth Hokage...

228
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,318
because it means strong and handsome right?

229
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,010
It won't happen with your current grade.

230
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,000
You're all very promising.

231
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,310
You all are very young unlike me.

232
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:27,639
It may be one of you who will receive the name Hokage.

233
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,772
You only live once...

234
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,316
so there's no need to force yourself to go on a certain path.

235
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,191
It is okay to live and die the way you wish.

236
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,858
However...

237
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,702
To protect the people precious to you can't be...

238
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:50,312
forgotten no matter what way you choose to live.

239
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,981
Precious people?

240
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,988
People who you truly recognize,

241
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:58,215
trust, and love from bottom of your heart.

242
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,456
Do you have somebody like that?

243
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,692
Yes.

244
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:07,678
My Dad, Mom, and Brother, even though I dislike him a little.

245
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,399
and my pet dog, Gonta.

246
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,513
In my case, that's my friends.

247
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,709
Me too.

248
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:20,567
So, Hokage-sama, you have somebody like that?

249
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:23,175
Sure, of course I do.

250
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,077
Who are they?

251
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:29,621
My grandson, Konohamaru over there, and...

252
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:37,289
everybody in this village.

253
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:54,923
Just like you were once.

254
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:40,006
This feeling...

255
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,200
It's that chakra.

256
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:03,113
This is...!

257
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:07,411
[sealed]

258
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,295
It's huge...

259
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:17,829
What is it?

260
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,259
Hey Kid...

261
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,406
Come a bit closer.

262
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:35,500
I want to eat you up, but this gate doesn't open.

263
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,671
It's because of this annoying seal.

264
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,763
You are...

265
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,027
Kyubi!

266
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:48,695
I see.

267
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:52,250
The red chakra is his.

268
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:59,040
You finally have come down here to see me...

269
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,982
What brought you here?

270
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,373
Hey, stupid fox!

271
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,019
Since I'm letting you stay in my body...

272
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,125
lend me your chakra as rent.

273
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:25,547
You're saying if you die, I'll die too in the end.

274
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:29,393
You got some guts to threaten me.

275
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:35,276
Alright.

276
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,529
I'll give you some as a reward for you coming down here.

277
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,040
This feeling!

278
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,958

Kuchiyose-no-jutsu!

279
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:04,763
Good job.

280
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:11,168
Where the fuck is this?

281
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,079
Alright! This time I summoned the real frog!

282
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:54,966
Hey, big frog! I'm your boss from today!

283
00:22:54,967 --> 00:23:00,198
Ah, that was nothing. I'm going to be your subordinate.

284
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,701
That makes me happy...

285
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:07,636
Next Episode. Fly! Jump! Dive! Gama Oyabun Appear!

286
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,664
I'm really scared. I've never seen a frog like this before.
