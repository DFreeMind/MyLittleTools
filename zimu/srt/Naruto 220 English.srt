1
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,139
So this is the Shukaku?

2
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,879
It's the first time I've seen
the real thing...

3
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,386
It's dangerous here!
We have to get away!

4
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,589
But! Gaara Sensei...

5
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:23,985
Shut up.

6
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:28,089
Gaara is trying... to protect you!

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,326
So hurry!

8
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,759
R-Right.

9
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:35,827
Hey! Could that be?!

10
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:37,005
Yeah...

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,872
The Shukaku transformation
is starting.

12
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,643
Gaara...

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,478
Naruto!

14
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:45,513
Naruto!

15
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,745
Hinata, Sakura.

16
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:50,481
Matsuri, you okay?

17
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,453
Y Yes. But Gaara Sensei...

18
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,448
I leave her to you...

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,034
Hold it! You are badly hurt!

20
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:10,996
But...

21
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,541
You'll just become unable
to move right away!

22
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,201
I'll give you some first aid treatment!

23
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:28,988
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

24
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:48,741
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

25
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:54,613
<i>because we were always together</i>

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,713
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

27
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:06,318
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

28
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

29
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:19,974
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

30
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:32,613
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

31
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:39,023
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

32
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:44,225
<i>Our two hearts</i>

33
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:00,648
<i>Departure</i>

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,618
This is bad... It's a matter of time.

35
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,253
I knew it.

36
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:09,281
Sakura! Hurry!
It looks like we don't have much time!

37
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:12,388
Got it! First, put your hands out.

38
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:13,754
R-Right...

39
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,834
What's the meaning of this?

40
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,602
What is it, Neji?

41
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:32,375
That guy wearing the armor is
releasing Chakra stronger than Gaara...

42
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:34,415
who's half transformed into a beast.

43
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:39,814
That person called himself Seimei,
the creator of the Village of Artisans.

44
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,049
He said something about being reborn
as the ultimate Ninja tool.

45
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:47,052
That jerk!
He's taken away Gaara's Chakra!

46
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:51,296
Come to think of it, the enemy
we fought wore similar armor...

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,565
and took away a great deal
of my Chakra.

48
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,034
Armor that sucks up Chakra...

49
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,400
And that alarming form...

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,230
It doesn't look like
we can just carelessly get close.

51
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,233
Now... What do we do?

52
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:08,149
I didn't figure on fighting
against the Shukaku...

53
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,212
However, this is fun, too.

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,780
As great as the Shukaku may be,
this way, I can prove that

55
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:18,122
it's no match for the ultimate Ninja tool
of the Village of Artisans.

56
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:33,273
<i>Why is this guy so strong?</i>

57
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:38,278
<i>I won't allow my important people...</i>

58
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,276
<i>to get hurt!</i>

59
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:46,120
<i>If not, I will stop you,</i>

60
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,122
<i>even if that means that</i>
<i>I have to kill you!</i>

61
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,880
Why...?

62
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,919
<i>How is it that you can fight</i>
<i>so much for other people...?</i>

63
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:58,797
<i>They saved me from</i>
<i>the hell of being all alone.</i>

64
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,762
<i>They accepted me for</i>
<i>who I was...</i>

65
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:06,466
<i>that's why...</i>
<i>they are important to me!</i>

66
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:13,707
<i>Love is a heart that desires to serve</i>
<i>a precious person who is close to oneself,</i>

67
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:16,307
<i>and to love and watch over that person...</i>

68
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,510
<i>Love...</i>

69
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,987
<i>That is why he is so strong?</i>

70
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:50,551
Gaara!

71
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:53,417
What's that?
Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?

72
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:55,651
What happened to him?!

73
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,523
Gaara might be suppressing
Shukaku of his own volition.

74
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:04,789
Why? Wouldn't he end up weakening
his own battle strength?

75
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,260
Even so, he chose to fight
with his own strength and will,

76
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,137
not Shukaku's power,
which he can't control.

77
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:39,094
So you couldn't maintain
the Shukaku body with that Chakra?

78
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:44,269
I'II... help the friends important
to me with my own power...

79
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,132
How absurd.

80
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,666
A Shinobi doesn't need emotion.

81
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:53,411
It is those who suppress their emotions
who can obtain great power.

82
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:58,343
Great power.
That power is the only justice.

83
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:00,585
You're finished now.

84
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:06,951
Eat this!

85
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:19,535
That's as far as you go,
monster of the Sand Village.

86
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,873
Acting tough, huh...?

87
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,409
You shouldn't have
any Chakra left to fight with.

88
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,446
Indeed, I only have a little bit
of Chakra left...

89
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:41,393
But do you think I just sat around
in the cage doing nothing at all?

90
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,530
What?!

91
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,056
Sand Tsunami!

92
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:55,737
You shouldn't have
any sand you can control!

93
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,639
I'm Gaara of the desert!

94
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,607
It's simple for me to crush rocks
and turn them into sand.

95
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,262
Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!

96
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:59,669
So you still had
that much power left, huh?

97
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,602
Then I'll just suck up all of that power!

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,215
Gaara's Chakra is being sucked out!

99
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,317
- Wha?!
- Gaara Sensei!

100
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:17,181
- Damn it!
- Wait! Naruto!

101
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,617
What, Shikamaru? Don't stop me!

102
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,724
You'll just get in the way if you go!

103
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,165
Besides, our Gaara is strong!

104
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:28,102
Gaara...

105
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:39,010
Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:

106
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,075
Shukaku's Pike!

107
00:09:56,298 --> 00:10:00,257
Wh Why...? Why could you...?

108
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,503
Someone who gave up on being human
and was reborn as a Ninja tool

109
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:05,767
could never understand anyway.

110
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,702
I don't understand. Why?

111
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:13,804
Why?!

112
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,520
Giant Sand Burial!

113
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,096
He did it!

114
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,000
Gaara Sensei won!

115
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,561
Yeah! Gaara!

116
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,113
- Gaara!
- Gaara!

117
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,110
He's okay...

118
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,181
He's just extremely fatigued

119
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,848
on account of using
his Chakra all at once.

120
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:00,286
Gaara completely suppressed
the Shukaku on his own volition.

121
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:01,829
Yeah...

122
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,265
<i>I want to work hard</i>

123
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,701
<i>and become an existence acknowledged</i>
<i>by other people...</i>

124
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:12,599
<i>I thought that looking</i>
<i>at Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

125
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:15,041
<i>Ties with other people...</i>

126
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:19,804
<i>For me, until now, that was just hate</i>
<i>and murderous intent.</i>

127
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,609
<i>However, there's something</i>
<i>I've understood just a little...</i>

128
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:29,987
<i>about the ties he goes so far for</i>
<i>and talks about.</i>

129
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:39,793
<i>Suffering, sorrow and happiness</i>
<i>can be shared with someone.</i>

130
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,740
You've also made someone
you can share with at last...

131
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,100
Did you say something?

132
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:50,438
No, nothing...

133
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,941
We came to the trouble
of rushing here.

134
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,382
To think it'd be over...

135
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,816
It seems
the inexperienced knuckleheads

136
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:06,258
have grown a teeny weeny bit...

137
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,489
You are very strict.

138
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,253
Pervy Sage!

139
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,355
Oh, long time no see, Naruto.

140
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:45,365
Don't give me that "long time no see"
garbage, you jerk Sage!

141
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,495
You were talking all big about
watching my training,

142
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,901
making me into your prot
and stuff!

143
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:52,369
Where were you traipsing
around until now?!

144
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:57,002
Well, how can I put this?
I was gathering information.

145
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:00,570
It was probably just information
on naked ladies anyway, right?

146
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,979
You idiot!

147
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,847
Even I come through when it counts...

148
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:08,744
I was mainly after information
on the Akatsuki.

149
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,224
Akatsuki!

150
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:13,220
With this I've been able
to verify their actions.

151
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:15,992
And now as promised,

152
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:19,556
two years later when
they'll move into high gear,

153
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:22,296
I will thoroughly train you.

154
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,604
I wonder if you're prepared?

155
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,109
I've been tired of waiting!

156
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,888
I owe you one.

157
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,992
No. I just repaid the debt
from last time.

158
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,032
Next time, I'll settle things
more properly.

159
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,904
Well, this time I'll acknowledge
that you didn't cry.

160
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,502
Not again.

161
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,507
Just like a woman...

162
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,044
What about him?

163
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:05,179
Huh?

164
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,872
Naruto?

165
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:10,479
I hear he's leaving today on
a training journey with Jiraiya.

166
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,150
Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?

167
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,889
Yeah.
It's such a pain.

168
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:19,421
He's going to come back
having gotten stronger again.

169
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:21,929
See you around.

170
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:23,924
- Farewell...
- See ya.

171
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,371
Please tell Naruto...

172
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,165
Thanks to him,

173
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,972
I figured out what the words
Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.

174
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,940
I'll dedicate myself under
Gaara Sensei from now on...

175
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,824
What did he do?

176
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:06,303
Well, I guess that's about it.

177
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:32,490
I read the Village of Artisans report
from the other day.

178
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,800
Although it didn't go as far as
a perfect 100,

179
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:38,839
I'll give you a passing grade.

180
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:41,003
No! I'm still very much lacking
in experience.

181
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,042
Of course!

182
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,277
I'll have you carry out
several missions

183
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,507
and get you to build up
lots of experience,

184
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:48,549
so make sure to dedicate yourself!

185
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,643
What?! Does that mean
I'm totally going to get overworked?

186
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,179
Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?

187
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,257
Ino?

188
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,826
Sure. What's up?

189
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:37,728
As, as it happens,
I was thinking about it the while...

190
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,227
But it became totally clear to me
on this mission!

191
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,368
Clear that I'd be no good at all
at this rate!

192
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,007
Ino.

193
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,234
It's frustrating,
but I was envious of you.

194
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:52,773
You, who everyone depended on.

195
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:56,712
So, please.
I also want to become a Medical Ninja.

196
00:16:58,052 --> 00:16:59,314
I know it'll be hard.

197
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:03,621
But I've got guts and I'll manage
the studying, no matter what.

198
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:06,683
So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?

199
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:09,530
- Sure.
- Really?!

200
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,289
But prepare yourself.

201
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,964
Once that happens,
you'll be my little sister prot.

202
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:16,828
What's that...?

203
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,233
Naturally!

204
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:24,267
After all, I'll be your
Medical Ninja superior, you know.

205
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,042
Man, I can't wait.

206
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,947
You'll be my lovable little sister prot.

207
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,985
I'll train you nice and hard.

208
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,579
Just you watch!
I'll pass you up right away!

209
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,854
Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!

210
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,053
I'll do it! Billboard Brow!

211
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,832
Why?! Why is it?!

212
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,128
What are you talking about?!

213
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:53,299
Why was I the only one left out
of the mission the other day?!

214
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:57,377
But you were with
a different team then, right?

215
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:59,913
But everyone had taken part!

216
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,014
She's kind of in a rage.

217
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,585
It's hard being the only one left out
of a mission.

218
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,914
Come to think of it,

219
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,923
it seems Naruto finally leaves
for training.

220
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,517
I heard. It seems that Jiraiya
is going to be his mentor.

221
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,094
Damn it! That guy's going
to get strong again.

222
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:23,026
It looks like the village will
get quiet for a while.

223
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:27,068
Viewed in that light,
it's a little bit sad, isn't it?

224
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,367
No! This isn't the time
to be getting sad!

225
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,706
I must work hard!

226
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,641
Several times more,
several times more.

227
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,078
If I don't work hard hundreds
of times more than Naruto,

228
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:41,144
I won't be able to face him
the next time we meet.

229
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,021
Your guard is off!

230
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:52,399
We also must grow by that time.

231
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:56,468
It's because trying to improve
by learning from others,

232
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,869
that is what's called friendship.

233
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:02,472
Good grief,
we'd better not lose, Akamaru.

234
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:04,735
Same here!

235
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,010
Hey, you okay, Lee?!

236
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,208
I'm fine, I'm fine.

237
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,796
Lady Hinata, let's call it a day.

238
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,194
What? I'm still...

239
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,101
It's about time for his departure.

240
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,505
Oh!

241
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,301
You won't be able to
see him for a while.

242
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,007
I see... It looks like you'll be
on a long journey...

243
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,115
Yeah!

244
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:48,245
Listen up.
Be sure to train and don't goof off.

245
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:50,723
Right! You can count on me!

246
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:57,097
It's about time to go, Naruto.

247
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:58,499
Right!

248
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,404
Okay! I'm off, Iruka Sensei!

249
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,869
I'll pay you back for the ramen
once I've become a success.

250
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:10,971
Jeez...

251
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,784
<i>Good luck, Naruto.</i>

252
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,503
Keep your eyes on me.

253
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,307
What're you doing?!
I'll leave you behind, Naruto.

254
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,874
Hey. H -Hey, wait up!

255
00:20:56,524 --> 00:21:00,153
<i>I also have to work hard in order</i>
<i>to catch up with Naruto.</i>

256
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,414
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

257
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:29,753
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

258
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:39,563
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

259
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:44,162
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

260
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:49,107
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

261
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:53,977
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

262
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,951
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

263
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,184
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

264
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:07,660
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

265
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:15,066
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

266
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:18,970
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

267
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,239
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

268
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:28,373
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

269
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:33,250
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

270
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:37,947
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

271
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:44,089
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

272
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,300
It's been two years since his departure.

273
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,663
Now the count down to
the battle begins.

274
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,568
Those who pursue and those
who are pursued.

275
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,006
Time will not wait for the boy.

276
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,245
As Akatsuki Organization begins
to take action,

277
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,510
the day of Orochimaru's reincarnation
draws near.

278
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,447
In order to take back what he lost,

279
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:13,585
the boy once again throws himself
into the maelstrom of cruel fate...

280
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:18,328
Next time: "Homecoming"
