1
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:03,644
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:06,479
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:12,581
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:29,039
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:34,477
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:37,174
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:40,684
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:51,852
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:56,893
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,968 --> 00:01:02,338
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:07,743
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:10,906
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:19,720
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:47,583
<i>A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools</i>

16
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,266
Naruto!

17
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,377
Naruto!

18
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,842
You've come back, Choji!

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,052
Yay!

20
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,583
Are you okay, Naruto!

21
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:31,061
I'm okay, but I'm not okay
with your heavy weight!

22
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,255
I'll get him right away!

23
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,026
Stop it Choji!
It doesn't work on him!

24
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:44,600
What?

25
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:53,509
This water absorbs all the shocks and
it gives me an iron wall defense.

26
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:54,574
Oh, really?

27
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,646
Shoot!

28
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,885
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!

29
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,562
I'm saved.

30
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:13,466
Where'd that guy go?!

31
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:23,543
After a bonfire, you should put it out.

32
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,332
There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,

33
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:51,569
but my water that the earth
gives me is infinite.

34
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:56,204
His Ninjutsu is endless.
So for now...

35
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:56,940
Wanna run away?

36
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:59,108
Say that you'll withdraw!

37
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,917
You can't get away.

38
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:13,730
Summoning Jutsu!

39
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,759
After them!

40
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:39,282
This way!

41
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:44,825
If you get caught by that water,
it's over for sure!

42
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,890
It's coming around from
this side too.

43
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,964
It's trying to trap us!

44
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:55,633
Run! Run! You're all going to
get eaten if you gethcaught!

45
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:58,969
At this rate, we're eventually
going to be defeated.

46
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,910
Looks like we've gotta beat him up,
after all.

47
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,536
But how are we going to beat him

48
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,310
if the attack doesn't work on him?

49
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,657
Damn!

50
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:22,494
Huh?

51
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,003
Don't you think
there's something weird about him?

52
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:34,206
Wh What is?

53
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,707
Hmm... I wonder?

54
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,371
Don't be joking at a time like this!

55
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:42,482
Perhaps, is Naruto talking
about his tonfa?

56
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:46,589
Oh yeah, he's holding his tonfa
like a dowsing rod.

57
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:47,486
That's it!

58
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,856
<i>It's called dousing.</i>

59
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,986
<i>If you concentrate on the item</i>
<i>you're looking for,</i>

60
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:56,090
<i>it will react to that item and inform you</i>
<i>when you get near it.</i>

61
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:57,896
Dowsing?

62
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,700
I see! Naruto, Choji!

63
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,465
We might have a chance to win!

64
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:04,399
Huh?

65
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,871
If that tonfa is the secret of
this Jutsu then...

66
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:09,604
Naruto!

67
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,615
Let's rap up the chase!

68
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:15,679
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

69
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:18,918
Idiot.

70
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,484
I'm not going to let you get away!

71
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,836
I've got you!

72
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:52,520
Seems like you tried to get close to me,
but too bad

73
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,151
Damn it!

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,563
I'm going to prepare
a special one for you.

75
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,837
Wh What Naruto?

76
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,843
Hurry up and run, Choji!

77
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,831
Yurinojou!

78
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,110
Yurinojou! Choji!

79
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,246
Choji!

80
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:02,019
Behind you!
Look behind you!

81
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:06,854
I said look behind you!

82
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:13,767
Choji!

83
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:22,604
Choji!

84
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,764
The fight is over.

85
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:44,201
First, the big one,
I'll eat you first.

86
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,326
Certainly the fight is over.

87
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:48,866
A fight where you're going to lose.

88
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:49,834
What?!

89
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,408
Right now Choji!
Drink up the water!

90
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:07,385
Useless, useless.

91
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:10,286
Water will gush out from the ground
with no limits.

92
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,956
Why isn't the water coming out?

93
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:19,000
Like I said, it's useless.

94
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,565
What happened?!

95
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:24,338
The water that will protect
you will not come out of here.

96
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,575
Look carefully at the surroundings...

97
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:31,581
Yes, water does not come out
of this craggy place.

98
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,779
I'm full!

99
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:48,554
Yurinojou has realized your secret.

100
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,669
I also thought something was strange.

101
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,562
When I went to check the trap,

102
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,098
I decided to take the shortest route
through the craggy area.

103
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:04,212
It wouldn't have been strange
to run into you there...

104
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,840
but that didn't happen.

105
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,945
The answer to that is easy!

106
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,047
You made a detour because
you avoided craggy areas

107
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:12,316
where the water wouldn't come out.

108
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,757
The tonfa you hold is a weapon

109
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:18,056
and was a way to find the water
through dowsing.

110
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:23,259
You lost them and you went away
from your advantageous places.

111
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,992
You mean... The reason why
you cracked my tonfa was...

112
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,531
Of course, it wasn't a coincidence.

113
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,310
It was planned by Yurinojou who
calculated your actions.

114
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,077
Damn it...!

115
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,745
This one will be heavy because
of the water!

116
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,746
Human Boulder!

117
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,640
You did it! Choji!

118
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:11,412
Yurinojou!

119
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,281
My ribs are injured, but...
I'm okay.

120
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:21,022
But there should be three of them,
so hurry and get the princess!

121
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,219
I got it!

122
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,119
Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.

123
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:25,952
Okay!

124
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:28,222
I'll catch up to Hinata!

125
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,404
Let me rest a little.

126
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,041
I got it.

127
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:41,133
Let's wait for everyone here.

128
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,549
There's no need to wait.

129
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:54,254
After we rest a little, you are going
to take me to a safe place.

130
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:56,823
But Naruto and the others are not yet...

131
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:58,452
That doesn't matter!

132
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:01,488
In the first place, everything became
like this because of you guys.

133
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,328
Instead of taking the long way,

134
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,427
if we had used the merchant people
as decoys,

135
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:09,098
then w e would have escaped by now!

136
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:12,806
Decoys?
But Kikusuke has already...

137
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:13,935
What about it?

138
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:19,148
If your mission as Ninja is to risk
your life in the line of duty,

139
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,945
then Kikunojou should be satisfied.

140
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,175
Even though Kikunojou is dead,

141
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:26,451
if I am still alive, then it's possible to
revive the Land of the Green.

142
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,450
Princess.

143
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:34,260
Hinata, you won't understand how
I was separated from my parents

144
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,663
to be held as hostage in
a foreign country

145
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,498
and how much I was bullied.

146
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:46,237
I realized then that only fools would expect
to live off of human compassion.

147
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,609
Especially someone like Naruto

148
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,045
who is easily influenced by
people's emotions

149
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,605
should be disqualified as a Ninja.

150
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:56,045
He loses his rationality in his goal.

151
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:59,720
Princess, what do you know
about Naruto?

152
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:04,023
Naruto has lived without his parents
since he was a child.

153
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:06,691
He has always lived alone.

154
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:10,965
To be accepted by everyone,
to become the next Hokage...

155
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,333
he has worked hard... really hard...

156
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,800
Despite all that, he didn't give up

157
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:20,640
and he would never think of
living at the expense of others.

158
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,212
He tried and tried.

159
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,979
Naruto and I are in different positions.

160
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,615
I'm sorry. You're right, Princess.

161
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:36,624
Hinata... Do you like Naruto?

162
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:40,761
I understand.

163
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:42,827
Let's wait for everyone here.

164
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,262
Princess...

165
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,400
That bag must be heavy.

166
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,759
I will relieve you
of some of the burden.

167
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,396
Oh, thanks.

168
00:13:56,747 --> 00:14:00,205
I cannot die in a place like this.

169
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,254
Don't you look nice, Ruiga.

170
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:17,963
Jiga... Help me... Brother...

171
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:19,728
Whatever.

172
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:26,668
If you die, Brother Renga and I could
split the Land of Green's profits.

173
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:27,671
Jiga...

174
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,476
Don't blame me.

175
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,171
W Wait!

176
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,281
S Stop Jiga...!

177
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:08,777
Hinata!

178
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:13,114
Hinata.

179
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,520
N -Naruto...

180
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,030
Where is the Princess?

181
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,466
That's what I was going to ask!

182
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:29,497
I said let's wait here and the minute
I turned around...

183
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,971
Why does a Ninja like you
get beaten by an amateur?

184
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:36,273
S Sorry.

185
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,140
Then right now she should be alone...

186
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,742
Naruto, w e should first go back
to the village

187
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,720
and get advice from the Hokage.

188
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,382
No!
There's no time for that.

189
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,927
There are still two Janin left.

190
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:54,330
She'll get killed if she gets caught.

191
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:57,694
But this really isn't an official mission.

192
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,262
We might not be able to
handle the other two...

193
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:03,000
You're right...

194
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:08,376
As you say, this may not be
an official mission but...

195
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:15,041
she's trying really hard to escape
by herself right now.

196
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:19,480
The things she says and does
may be wrong,

197
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:22,992
but somehow,
I can't leave her alone.

198
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,719
Naruto, I'll also...

199
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:26,421
Hinata!

200
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,699
Yurinojou got hurt.

201
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,796
You and Choji,
please take care of Yurinojou!

202
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:35,668
See you later!

203
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:36,398
Oh!

204
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,970
Be careful, Naruto...

205
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,220
Right there!

206
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,463
I see, you have good instincts.

207
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,098
I'll praise you for getting Ruiga.

208
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,530
Are you the second Janin?

209
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:16,012
Oh, I feel honored that you know
about me.

210
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:19,275
Then you should brag about it
in the other world.

211
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,552
That Mr. Jiga killed you,
so it couldn't be helped.

212
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,986
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

213
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:36,360
What?

214
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,465
That wouldn't work.

215
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,634
This guy...

216
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,869
What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?

217
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:53,645
A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh?
How interesting.

218
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:56,151
I'll put them down as
one of my next targets.

219
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,687
I won't let you do that!

220
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,358
How did?

221
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,133
Yup.

222
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:15,331
My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.

223
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:27,849
It's like this!

224
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>I will live, no matter what...</i>

225
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:09,492
This is your graveyard.

226
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:13,391
I will return those words
right back at you.

227
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,698
You!

228
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,666
Then.

229
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:20,501
There!

230
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,640
Damn!
What's going on?!

231
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:37,212
What should I do?
I can't find Choji.

232
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:42,481
I'm sure that he's somewhere
hiding his presence, but...

233
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,931
This is... Naruto's forehead band.

234
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,067
Naruto...

235
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:04,004
I grew up drinking iron.

236
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:07,807
That's why I can use the iron

237
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,786
that has accumulated in my body
and turn myself into a magnet.

238
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:15,085
This rocky mountain contains
lots of iron,

239
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:17,422
making it my invincible battle field.

240
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,395
Change yourself into magnet...?

241
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:25,166
By the way, I could also change
the things I touch into magnets.

242
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:29,735
I've already changed the rocks behind you
into powerful magnets.

243
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:33,869
So what are you trying to do?!

244
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:38,714
I mean this!
Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!

245
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,352
Second hit! Third hit!

246
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,582
Naruto!

247
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:55,126
Your friend... I'll take good care of her.

248
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,164
Hinata! Don't come!

249
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:05,038
He is...

250
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,540
He is... a dangerous... opponent...

251
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,041
Naruto!

252
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,663
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

253
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,335
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

254
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,943
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

255
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:57,824
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

256
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:02,922
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

257
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:09,905
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

258
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:16,811
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

259
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,581
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

260
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:30,355
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

261
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:37,032
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

262
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:44,066
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

263
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:50,407
What should I do?

264
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:53,409
My Gentle Fist won't work against
his Ninja Art.

265
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:57,043
It's frustrating, but I can't win against him
if I fight him head on.

266
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,420
At this rate, Naruto will...

267
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:01,920
No, no, I won't let that happen.

268
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:05,086
I will discover the weakness
of his Jutsu.

269
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:09,459
I won't give up!
I'll stop him, no matter what!

270
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,994
Next time:
"The Byakugan Sees the Blind Spot!

271
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,335
I'm going to risk everything
in this single attack!
