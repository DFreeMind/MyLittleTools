1
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:21,705
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:26,514
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,146
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:31,747
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,353
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:46,270
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:55,641
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,616 --> 00:01:06,423
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:15,900
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:21,030
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,688
Mess up the village... you say?!

12
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,730
I won't let you do that
no matter what!

13
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,500
I mean, there's no way
just the four of you can do that!

14
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:53,667
But, we can...

15
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,437
A person who knows village matters
very well gave us information

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,841
on where and how to attack.

17
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:01,180
Knows village matters very well...

18
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,507
It couldn't be!

19
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:05,446
You mean Orochimaru?!

20
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,877
Who knows...?

21
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,817
Well, that's how it is,
so we can't have you guys living.

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,818
Umm, can you see this?

23
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,064
Paper Bombs!

24
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,961
We're going to detonate
the Paper Bombs

25
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,127
after we've left here...

26
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,926
There's nowhere to run...

27
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,234
There's no chance of someone
coming to save you.

28
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:28,599
Prepare yourselves.

29
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:31,242
It's better than going back
to the Academy, isn't it?

30
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:34,340
Umm, rest in peace.

31
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,911
H-Hey! Just a minute!

32
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,979
Farewell, real me.

33
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:48,394
<i>Run, Dodge, Zigzag!</i>
<i>Chase or be Chased!</i>

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,465
It should've just been
hunting for treasure,

35
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,363
but to think this would happen...

36
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,436
Sure enough,
nothing good comes

37
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:00,938
of being together with you
on missions, Naruto!

38
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,266
This isn't the time to be
saying stuff like that!

39
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,340
They're attempting to mess up
the Leaf Village by impersonating us!

40
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:11,443
Then how're we going
to get out of here?!

41
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,415
Well...

42
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,313
If I use the Rasengan,
I could somehow...

43
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,156
They'd notice that!

44
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,659
It'd be the end if we were
to get ambushed outside.

45
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,323
Then, with your Fang Over Fang...

46
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,258
That'd be the same, the same!

47
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:27,495
You moron!

48
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,225
Then what should we do?!

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,300
- Umm...
- Huh?

50
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,633
If I use
my Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms...

51
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:35,904
I get it!

52
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,611
With that we can weather this crisis
without the guys outside noticing!

53
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,479
If I could just loosen
these ropes a little...

54
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:45,777
Leave that to me!

55
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:52,781
N -Naruto?!

56
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,120
All right!

57
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,458
Me, too!

58
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:58,794
Kiba...

59
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:03,265
Akamaru...

60
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,835
<i>Just a little more...</i>

61
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:18,712
<i>It snapped...</i>

62
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,190
Protective 8 Trigrams...

63
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,003
64 Palms!

64
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,947
Now then,
shall we go as arranged?

65
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,849
- Kiba!
- Yeah!

66
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:58,116
- Hinata!
- Yes!

67
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,183
Naruto!

68
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,992
I know!

69
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:17,475
Hinata!

70
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,341
You okay?

71
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:21,704
Oh...!

72
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:26,709
What...?

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,320
Hey, Hinata!
Cut our ropes before you faint.

74
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,287
Right.

75
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:44,763
It seems the guys outside
are gone.

76
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,967
It doesn't look like this place
is going to hold up now.

77
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,843
It looks like it'd be best for us
to escape as soon as we can.

78
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:57,311
What's that?!

79
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:59,007
It's the buried treasure chest.

80
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,115
Leave it be!

81
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,546
It's a fake anyway.

82
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,981
And there might be
some kind of trap set.

83
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:07,393
But it's our mission to
take this back with us, so...

84
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:10,756
There really might be
buried treasure in it, right?!

85
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:11,855
Byakugan!

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,966
It looks empty inside...
Wait, there's paper inside.

87
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,194
Isn't it a Paper Bomb?

88
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,105
It doesn't seem to be
anything dangerous...

89
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:26,435
Then I guess I'll take it for now.

90
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,275
Come on, there's no need
to go to the trouble of...

91
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:33,845
But it might make for a good mark
to distinguish him from the imposter...

92
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,177
I get it.

93
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:40,755
Akamaru, you're the mark for
the real me, so stay close to me.

94
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:46,594
There's no time.

95
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,927
I'll be going with our Fang Over Fang.
Make sure you keep up!

96
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:52,226
R-Right.

97
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,034
Man Beast Clone...

98
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,441
Fang Over Fang!

99
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,612
You okay, Hinata?

100
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:15,590
I'm fine... I just have to follow
after Kiba, so... I'll be o...

101
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:18,523
Hinata!

102
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,363
All right!

103
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,179
You okay, Hinata?

104
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,881
Naruto!

105
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:45,685
Does your leg hurt?

106
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,053
Kiba...

107
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,861
If your leg hurts, say so first.

108
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,396
I was thinking
I must not cause trouble, so...

109
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,965
Actually, that is trouble.

110
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,438
I'm sorry...

111
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:05,770
Surprisingly, this might be
the weakness of our team.

112
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:06,841
Huh?

113
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,939
Hinata shows too much
concern for us.

114
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:14,277
Naruto and I speak too bluntly to
each other and we get into fights...

115
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,551
N -Now that you mention it...

116
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,683
If we'd take on our missions while
being a little conscious of stuff like that,

117
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,854
we might...
become a pretty good team.

118
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,264
Got it!

119
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,032
I'll try...

120
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,564
All right. Then Naruto and I will go
after those guys.

121
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,309
Hinata, you come later.
Your leg's hurt, so don't force things...

122
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:39,806
Got it.

123
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,775
Listen up. You're hurt, Hinata.
So you follow later.

124
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:47,318
I just said that, didn't I?

125
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,047
Huh? Did you?

126
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,786
Right... Thanks...

127
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,751
Let's go, Naruto!

128
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,892
<i>I have to hurry, too...</i>

129
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,230
I'm back!

130
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:07,668
You're back, Naruto?

131
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,306
We couldn't catch up
with them, huh...?

132
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,779
Naruto? Kiba?!

133
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,251
Was I here just now?!

134
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,749
Y Yeah.

135
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,091
That one was an imposter!

136
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:28,123
Say what?!

137
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:30,284
But the dog didn't notice anything...

138
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,327
He can't be sniffed out even
with the nose of a Ninja Hound!

139
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,165
Akamaru was fooled, too!

140
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,604
We've got trouble!
To the Hokage, immediately.

141
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:39,160
Right!

142
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,803
Akamaru! You remember the smell
of that Agari old man, right?!

143
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:44,805
After him!

144
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:49,442
Lady Tsunade!

145
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:51,643
We've just received
a communication...!

146
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,019
Nobody realizes it.

147
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:59,715
Stay sharp.
Our mission isn't over yet, so.

148
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:01,983
That's right.
The crucial part comes now.

149
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,193
Someone's coming!

150
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,899
We found you, imposters!

151
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,406
We'll kick your butts!

152
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,349
Oh ho... So you're alive...

153
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,942
Naturally!

154
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,621
This time it's your turn
to prepare yourselves...

155
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,915
After all, this is our home field.

156
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,658
There are times when you lose

157
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,755
even when fighting
on your home field!

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,794
We won't let you get away!

159
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:46,968
H-Hinata?!

160
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,140
I'm going to inform the Hokage!

161
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,571
Naruto, you go after the imposters!

162
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,743
Got... it.

163
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,039
Hey...

164
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:03,716
<i>Upon careful thought,</i>
<i>the real Hinata hasn't come yet...!</i>

165
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,347
You imposter!

166
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:10,323
What the...?!

167
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,333
What're you doing to Hinata?!

168
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:20,463
<i>It's just like I'm the imposter.</i>

169
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,070
Naruto!

170
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,139
What're you doing?!

171
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,135
W Well...

172
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,447
He's an imposter!

173
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,037
What?!

174
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,953
Prepare yourself, imposter!

175
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,017
Hey! Wait a minute!

176
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:39,787
Hey, you're also an imposter!

177
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,259
Even if you can copy
the appearance and scent,

178
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,355
you can't go so far as
copy Ninjutsu, right?!

179
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,163
Let's go, Akamaru.

180
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,134
Fang Over?

181
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:58,741
Knocked out?

182
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,146
No way. It was just a punch,
and I didn't even use a Jutsu...

183
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,407
Come to think of it...

184
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:08,653
I was slugged good and hard,
but I didn't feel it at all.

185
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,353
Hey! Weren't you going
to mess up the villaget?!

186
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,850
You guys are utterly weak!

187
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:16,920
Damn it!

188
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,027
I'll catch the fake Hinata,
so you handle yourself somehow!

189
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:22,593
Leave me to me!

190
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:23,633
Hold it!

191
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:26,899
Hold it!

192
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,339
I wonder if I got overly ambitious
and borrowed too many books...

193
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,445
Hey, Naruto!

194
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,253
You...

195
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,996
You moron!

196
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,164
You're butt is so heavy
you fell right on it!

197
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:58,035
Ugly! Ugly!

198
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,639
Forehead girl!

199
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:08,072
I'll kick your butt
the next time I see you!

200
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:11,679
I'll kick your butt,
no matter what!

201
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,550
Sakura, get out of the way!

202
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:17,145
Naruto.

203
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,888
I'll kick your butt!

204
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,560
Wh Why?!

205
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:30,163
What?

206
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:35,164
Why's the Naruto who ran that way
coming from over here?

207
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,544
I'm off on a delivery.

208
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,174
Right. Take care.

209
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,819
What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!

210
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:51,523
Y Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in...

211
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,052
What...?

212
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,495
Na -ru -to!

213
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,056
How dare you do that
to my daughter?!

214
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,336
Wh What...?

215
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,135
I'm okay, Dad.

216
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,500
No, you rest a bit.

217
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,840
I will have Naruto take the responsibility
and make the delivery!

218
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,443
What?!

219
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,208
But, but I...

220
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:18,941
If you refuse,

221
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,013
I'll never let you eat
my ramen ever again!

222
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,489
This isn't the time for me
to be making a delivery!

223
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,160
I finished the delivery!

224
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,353
Okay! Good work!

225
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,124
Where did he go?!

226
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,160
My... imposter!

227
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,840
This jerk was also weak...

228
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:47,535
Kiba... Stop...
Forgive me...

229
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,777
That might've worked on Naruto.
But I hate soppy stuff...

230
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,546
like that!

231
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,951
Did these guys seriously
intend to attack the village...?

232
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,162
Where are you, imposter?!

233
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:07,626
Come out!

234
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,096
Hey!

235
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:10,359
Hey!

236
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:16,431
Could it be that I came here?

237
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,199
Yeah, you did.

238
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:21,913
You'll be paying me for
what you ate earlier.

239
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:23,811
That jerk...!

240
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,661
Forty -five plates...

241
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,536
Here.

242
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,919
Eating and running with
someone else's face...

243
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,622
That imposter...

244
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,822
He's not messing up the village,
he's messing up my reputation.

245
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:13,623
Hey...

246
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,329
No way...!

247
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,277
My Golden Delicious Ninja Way
Ramen Pure Heart of Fire

248
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,973
I'd been setting aside!

249
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:35,049
I won't allow it...!

250
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,949
No matter what, I won't allow it!

251
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,751
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

252
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:44,962
- Go!
- Go!

253
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,889
- Where is he?!
- Where's the imposter?!

254
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,560
- Where are you?!
- Imposter!

255
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,498
Where are you?! Come out!

256
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,135
I'll kill you, imposter!

257
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,571
I'll pay the bill later!

258
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,374
- Find him!
- Where is he?!

259
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,075
There he is!

260
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:07,675
Hey!

261
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,485
- I won't let you get away!
- Got you!

262
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,755
- I've got you!
- You're wrong!

263
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,294
- Is it you?!
- I'm not an imposter!

264
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,024
Calm down, guys!

265
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:24,202
The imposter isn't carrying
a chest on his back!

266
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,533
- What?
- It's not him?

267
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,401
- Now that you mention it...
- That's right.

268
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,667
That's right!

269
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,078
Then...

270
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:37,973
It's him!

271
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,485
Yikes!

272
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:47,653
At the end of the day,
these guys were nothing special.

273
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,754
Hey, are these guys really
Orochimaru's henchmen?

274
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:52,860
Who knows?

275
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:55,827
The Hokage will look
into the details for us.

276
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:56,764
That's right.

277
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,564
Man, I'm tired.

278
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:01,531
My shoulders got stiff from carrying
this thing around the whole time.

279
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,203
Naruto! Kiba!

280
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,914
Oh, the real Hinata's come back.

281
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,783
Hey, Hinata! Over here!

282
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:14,942
Naruto!

283
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:20,882
<i>He's not carrying the chest on his back...</i>
<i>Then this Naruto...</i>

284
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,228
<i>He's the imposter!</i>

285
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,128
Gentle Fist!

286
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:35,667
Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto...

287
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:40,311
- What?!
- What?!

288
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,073
A test?!

289
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,739
This mission was a test

290
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:48,343
in order to see the teamwork
of you three.

291
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:53,057
A Shinobi will often have to
form teams with various others

292
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,855
in response to the qualities
and conditions of the mission.

293
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,690
At such times,

294
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:01,699
failing if teamed with
a certain other person is a problem.

295
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:06,104
And so I gave you a mission
that was easy at the start.

296
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,433
And I made it so along
the way...

297
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,441
something would happen
involving a village crisis.

298
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:12,810
At that time,

299
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,369
I wanted to see whether
you could handle it as a team.

300
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:16,846
So that's what it was...

301
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:18,346
That's harsh!

302
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:21,382
We would've died if
we'd made the slightest mistake.

303
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:28,682
It's okay. I got the story about
you guys from Lady Tsunade.

304
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,262
It was set up so even if
you were to make a mistake,

305
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,661
you would only be injured.

306
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,391
Since this time around
you had the Ninja Hound Akamaru,

307
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,731
I enlisted the help
of the Kedouin Clan...

308
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,500
so you wouldn't be able
to distinguish the enemy.

309
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:44,167
And?

310
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,569
How did these three do?

311
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:47,870
Let me see...

312
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:54,544
They floundered part of the way
and I was worried about the outcome...

313
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:00,649
But I shall pass them.

314
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,455
In terms of results,
they <i>did</i> capture us, so...

315
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,559
Oh yeah.

316
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:09,763
That's...!

317
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:13,095
It was more or less
our mission to bring this, so.

318
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,799
With this, our mission is complete.

319
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,042
There's no point in going
to the trouble of bringing...

320
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:19,171
No, no.

321
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:25,106
There is something important inside
that I must give to you, Lady Hokage.

322
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:29,983
Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.

323
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:31,482
You, too.

324
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,620
See ya.

325
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,347
Yeah.

326
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,325
Are they going to look
like that forever?

327
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:44,625
It seems they'll get their own faces back
naturally in a few days.

328
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,465
I see...

329
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,095
Wh What's this...?!

330
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,566
A bill for the recent training...?!

331
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,804
Here... he said he'd be glad
to cooperate...

332
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:58,278
It comes to this much?

333
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,151
This is a hard world to live in,
isn't it?

334
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,479
<i>My name is Tsunade...</i>

335
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:07,724
<i>My concern now is a debt</i>
<i>that absolutely will not go down.</i>

336
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:10,586
More like, it's growing, isn't it?

337
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,625
I shouldn't have become...
the likes of Hokage...!

338
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,350
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

339
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:38,151
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

340
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,757
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

341
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:43,760
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

342
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:47,822
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

343
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,401
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

344
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,660
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

345
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,536
<i>The images.</i>

346
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,546
<i>It probably will not end</i>

347
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:08,942
<i>It probably will not end</i>

348
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:13,792
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

349
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,818
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

350
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,862
<i>Running freely</i>

351
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:23,492
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

352
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,594
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

353
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:29,572
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

354
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:36,178
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

355
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,449
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

356
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:42,954
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

357
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:54,862
No, it's gone, gone, gone!
Where'd you put it, Naruto?

358
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:56,935
Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it.

00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:57,594
You wrote it?

360
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,829
And I gave it to
a Delivery Ninja.

361
00:22:58,904 --> 00:22:59,802
You gave it?

362
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,840
So it should reach
the other party today.

363
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,401
You idiot!
At this rate, my life as a writer will...

364
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,536
More importantly,
let's get the training started.

365
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:09,978
Shut up and come with me, Naruto!

366
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,446
We have to get that back at any cost!

367
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:15,912
Next time: "Please, Mr. Postman!"
