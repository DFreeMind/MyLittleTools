2
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,947
His opponent is Neji...

3
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,324
The final round is totally different from the prelims.

4
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,134
I don't think Naruto can...

5
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:15,074
Let me have at least a little fun, Naruto kun.

6
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:20,628
A very hard job is waiting for me...

7
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:28,057
Zero Blind spots!
Another Absolute Defense

8
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,449
Shit! I can't catch him at all!

9
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,614
I told you that I'm not that stupid.

10
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,080
I've already figured out...

11
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,581
which one is the real body!

12
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:33,759
The one that attacks the least because
it's afraid of having his Tenketsu pressed.

13
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:38,370
The more you attack me, the easier it is to find the one.

14
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,123
The real one is you.

15
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,427
This is the end.

16
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,525
That's why I said it's useless.

17
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,788
Naruto kun, please don't lose.

18
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:09,534
That's why... I told you to stop jumping to conclusions.

19
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,755
No way!

20
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,132
Alright! Go for it, Naruto!

21
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:29,669
Did he read my mind and have one of clones attack less?

22
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:34,976
After all, I'm ready to die in this match attacking you!

23
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,807
I did it!

24
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:45,635
That is...

25
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,847
What was that?

26
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,922
You thought you won?

27
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,444
Why?

28
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,994
Naruto's punch must've landed on him.

29
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,301
That is...

30
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:18,865
Kaiten!

31
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,247
That's Neji's defense.

32
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:27,852
Man!

33
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:29,837
Don't underestimate me!

34
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,439
The maximum sight of Neji's Byakugan is almost 360 degree.

35
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:42,829
And he senses all the attacks from the opponent with Byakugan.

36
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:49,204
From that point on, Neji's defense, Hakke-sho Kaiten begins!

37
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:13,881
Right before the attacks land on him, he releases a large
amount of chakra from chakra holes all over his body.

38
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,337
With that chakra, he receives the
attacks. He then spins his body,

39
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:20,931
to avoid attacks and repel them.

40
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:26,842
In reality, it is hard to control
chakra released from the chakra holes.

41
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:32,226
Even Jonins are only able to use it for some jutsu by
releasing it from hands, legs, and other certain part of body.

42
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:38,349
But Neji mastered Juken and can
release it from all over his body,

43
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,213
and with only the quantity of the released chakra,
he can completely shut out physical attacks.

44
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,427
In other words, it is more powerful than Gaara's...

45
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,935
It's another absolute defense!

46
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,832
That is father's...

47
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:05,465
Kaiten is a secret Jutsu that is only passed down to
an heir of the Hyuga Souke (main clan) traditionally.

48
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,344
But it's like he created that by himself...

49
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,125
What a guy... I didn't guess he was this much...

50
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:18,949
It's too early to be surprised. Neji's
real ability will be shown from here!

51
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,717
Shit.

52
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,184
This will be the end.

53
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:29,118
You are within my Hakke territory.

54
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:45,256
Ju-kenpo
Hakke 64-sho!

55
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:48,266
No way! That stance is!

56
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,150
Hakke...

57
00:07:59,301 --> 00:07:59,966
Ni-sho (2)

58
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:04,085
Yon-sho (4)

59
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:06,852
Hassho (8)

60
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,403
Juroku-sho (16)

61
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,113
Sanju-ni-sho
(32)

62
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,247
Rokuju-yon-sho
(64)

63
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,759
One person from the Bunke exceeds one from the Souke...

64
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,523
I see it's over.

65
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,533
That's truly amazing talent.

66
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:54,412
Who would've thought that the one who received the power
of Hyuga's Kekkei-genkai (blood limit) the strongest...

67
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:57,666
was a boy in Bunke who could never be an heir.

68
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:03,657
Hizashi... after all, you could've been in the Hyuga family’s.

69
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:08,243
I pressed 64 chakra holes on your entire body.

70
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,427
You won't be able to stand up anymore.

71
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,326
shit...

72
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:17,876
Vexed?

73
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:22,931
Kneeled down in front of a fate that can't be
changed and you finally realize you're powerless.

74
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:28,825
A dream will come true with hard work? That' just an illusion.

75
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:33,832
Hey, Hinata. Are you alright?

76
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,401
Oh man... as expected, eh.

77
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,047
Geji-mayu...
(thick-eyebrows)

78
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,235
Hinata...

79
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,974
Shit!

80
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:47,324
You... impossible...

81
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:55,806
I told you that I'm not good at giving up.

82
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,861
Impossible!

83
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,141
Hey, you're bleeding!

84
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,291
What's wrong?

85
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:17,653
You still have damage from the match...

86
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,832
Hinata! Calm down.

87
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:27,827
I'll take a look at her.

88
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,271
Who are you?

89
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:33,632
Well, I'm not somebody you need to suspect.

90
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,231
Stop it. It'll be the same result even if we fight any longer.

91
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,448
I don't hold a grudge against you anyway.

92
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:46,968
Be quiet. Even if you say so, I do hold one against you!

93
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,406
What are you talking about?

94
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:53,028
Why... why even though you're so strong...

95
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,514
and act like you see through everything...

96
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:02,725
you chose to mentally attack Hinata
who was making every effort she could!

97
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,922
It's none of your business!

98
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:11,272
You made light of Hinata, and concluded that she's a loser.

99
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:16,391
I don't know what happened between the Souke and Bunke, but

100
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,880
I will never allow an asshole like you to call people losers!

101
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,074
Hey you are...?

102
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,335
Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

103
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,696
I understand. If you say that much, then I'll tell you about...

104
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,283
the hatred fate of the Hyuga.

105
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,869
Hyuga Souke has a secret ninjutsu that's been
passed down from generation to generation.

106
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,699
That is Juin-jutsu.

107
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,721
Juin-jutsu?

108
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:02,707
The cursed seal indicates that you're a bird in a cage...

109
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:07,737
Proof that you're one who is tied to a fate you can't escape.

110
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,518
What is it?

111
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,181
That seal is...

112
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:44,519
One day when I was four, I was inscribed by this
disgusting seal on my forehead by that Juin-jutsu.

113
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:50,708
On that day, there was a huge ceremony in Konoha village.

114
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:56,906
It was also the day when a shinobi-kashira from Kumo-kakure (Hidden Cloud) in
Kaminarai (Thunder) country that had been in war against Konoha for a long time...

115
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,624
came to seal the alliance treaty.

116
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:10,157
But there was one clan that wasn't attending the ceremony,
which everybody in Konoha, from Genin to Jonin attended.

117
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:13,067
That was the Hyuga Clan.

118
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:18,422
It was a long-awaited day when
the heir of the Souke turned three.

119
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,893
It was Hinata-sama's third birthday.

120
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:44,256
My father, Hyuga Hizashi, and Hinata-sama's father,
Hyuga Hiashi, who's sitting over there, were twins.

121
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:52,522
But Hinata-sama's father, Hiashi-sama was born
first to this world, the eldest son to be Souke,

122
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:57,321
and the second son, my father was Bunke.

123
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:03,351
Hinata-sama is already three. Congratulations.

124
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:04,590
Yes.

125
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,568
She's a cute girl, father.

126
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,396
What's wrong, father?

127
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,251
No, it's nothing.

128
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:33,085
Then, I'll take care of Neji, Hizashi.

129
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,245
Yes.

130
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,916
When an heir of Souke grows up and turns three,

131
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:44,901
I was inscribed by this seal and became a bird in a cage...

132
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,840
I became a Bunke of Hyuga!

133
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,504
Why was it necessary to do such a thing?

134
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:56,375
What meanings does it have... to separate
Souke and Bunke, or to give the strange seal?

135
00:15:56,494 --> 00:16:00,513
The seal on this forehead is not just a decorative mark.

136
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:10,913
Your footwork is not good.

137
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,190
Yes.

138
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:28,095
Listen, Neji. You live for protecting
Hinata-sama of Souke and the Hyuga's ability.

139
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,397
Yes, father.

140
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,253
Sakkie! (dangerous spirit, blood-thirst)

141
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,681
Father

142
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:08,538
Father, what is wrong?

143
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:14,845
Go home. Today is the last to forgive a fool.

144
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:19,000
Never forget your destiny.

145
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,908
This seal is, in other words, a death,
an absolute terror that Souke gives Bunke.

146
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:36,303
The seal that Souke performs will easily
destroy the brains nervous system of the Bunke.

147
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,840
Of course, it is easy to kill.

148
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:44,790
And this seal will disappear only when I die.

149
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:48,052
Forever concealing the ability of Byakugan!

150
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:56,681
The Hyuga family is one clan that
has the most unique Kekkei-genkai.

151
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,046
There isn't any shortage of people who
want the secrets of this unique ability.

152
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:07,531
In other words, this seal is an effective
system that Bunke uses only to protect the Souke.

153
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:17,082
By never allowing the Bunke to disobey the Souke, and us
protecting the ability of the Kekkei-genkai, Byakugan forever.

154
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,633
And... then the incident happened.

155
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:28,815
My father was killed by the Souke!

156
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,427
One night, Hinata-sama was almost abducted by somebody.

157
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,308
Then, Hiashi-sama quickly came and killed the guy.

158
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:15,312
In the darkness, covering his face
with a mask... guess who that was?

159
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:22,710
The guy was Shinobi-kashira of Kaminari
country, who had just sealed the alliance treaty!

160
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:27,279
It was obvious that they came to get the
secret of Byakugan from the beginning.

161
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,520
But the Kaminari country asked for unreasonable
conditions saying Konoha broke the treaty...

162
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:38,511
because their shinobi was killed in the failure of their plan.

163
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,728
Of course, the relationship between Konoha and Kaminari
grew worse and they were close to starting a war.

164
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:55,564
But Konoha that wanted to avoid a war
and made a backdoor deal with Kaminari.

165
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,191
A deal?

166
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:08,223
The Kaminari demanded a dead body of a Hyuga Souke that
has the Byakugan... the dead body of Hyuga Hiashi-sama.

167
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:13,568
And Konoha accepted that demand.

168
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,744
But father is...

169
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:20,449
And a war was avoided.

170
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:29,515
Thanks to my dad, who was killed as Hyuga
Hiashi's double to protect the Souke!

171
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:35,058
There is no other way than death
to escape from this disgusting seal.

172
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:44,945
Even though they were twins whose abilities were almost even,
their fates were decided when one was born before the other.

173
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:57,421
And this match... your fate was already
decided when your opponent was decided as me!

174
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,737
Did he really close all my Tenketsu?

175
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:45,238
Shit... I can't feel my chakra in my entire body at all.

176
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,718
It is like the time when I used up all my
chakra during the training with Ero-sennin.

177
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,797
Wait... I get it.

178
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,364
Be surprised. I'm going to channel chakra no matter what!

179
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:00,176
