3
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:37,468
Hey! Open Up!

4
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,366
What is it at this time?

5
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:46,628
Idiot! I told you repeatedly to
not take your eyes off from him.

6
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,142
No way... Gaara...

7
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:58,009
Where did he go?

8
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:07,501
I hope nothing happens...

9
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:13,471
A Evil Hand Sneaks Up! A Hospital Room Targeted.

10
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:25,854
Konoha Hospital

11
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,738
He sleeps a lot... it's like he's dead.

12
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:03,281
Yamanaka Flowershop

13
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:10,397
Sasuke-kun hasn't been back yet.

14
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:23,018
I get Sasuke-kun's information before you get it.

15
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,345
You failed to go see him alone, Dekorin-chan.

16
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:31,027
Not that. This is for Lee-san.

17
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,853
It's about time for the last one to die.

18
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,085
I see...

19
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:42,732
Lee-kun! Stop it!

20
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,171
191!

21
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:47,062
Please don't touch me!

22
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:50,284
I'm not finished yet!

23
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:51,581
Here you go.

24
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:54,507
Thank you.

25
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,456
I hope Lee-san's better.

26
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,465
Yup.

27
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,221
Huh?

28
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,096
What's up with that?

29
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:31,775
It's useless. It's totally clogged... so troublesome.

30
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,708
Hey. You finally woke up, eh?

31
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,229
Where is this?

32
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,421
The Hospital. I heard you were sleeping
all day and all night for three days.

33
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:50,730
Three days...

34
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,805
Three days and nights?!

35
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,675
What... what is it?

36
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,267
Shikamaru! When does the real final start?

37
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,657
T...tomorrow.

38
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,095
Whaaaaaat?!?!

39
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,711
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?!

40
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:09,165
I don't have the luxury to keep sleeping at a place like this!

41
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:12,458
Where's Ero Sennin? Where is he?

42
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,684
I need him to train me soon.

43
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:18,828
Huh? What're you talking about? I have no idea...

44
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,411
I can't find my clothes.

45
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,282
Where? where where where?

46
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:29,211
Man... when I thought he's been sleeping a
long time, he starts moving around like crazy.

47
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,578
Calm down a little bit!

48
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:37,361
Listen. Nothing will change even
you try to do something one day before.

49
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,265
Taking a rest is also part of training...

50
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:44,470
Hey, Naruto... What's wrong with you?

51
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,731
I'm hungry.

52
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:51,161
Hey... Don't make me surprised for everything you do.

53
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:52,592
Oh, yeah.

54
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:01,919
It was so tiresome, but I bought a Fruit-set for Choji.

55
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:05,161
But the doctor said no. So, let's eat this together.

56
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:08,864
Choji? Did he get that much damage?

57
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:13,422
Don't get it wrong. He ate too much Yakiniku...

58
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,830
and broke his stomach. That's how he got serious damage.

59
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,117
That's just like Choji.

60
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:23,043
Well, you two are not the type of guys
whom girls pay a visit at hospital.

61
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,293
Here you go.

62
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,290
Looks delicious.

63
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,467
What?

64
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,998
Let's eat in front of Choji,
since we're gonna eat these anyway.

65
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,463
You're tiresome. (You make me tired.)

66
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,042
Nobody is here.

67
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,807
OUT FOR LUNCH

68
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:51,165
It's during lunch time?

69
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:54,228
Oh well...

70
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:04,647
Good.

71
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,398
Lee-san... I'll leave the flower here for you.

72
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,255
This isn't enough for me.

73
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,836
Are you trying to annoy me, Shikamaru?

74
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,180
Oh, that's right.

75
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,074
Why did you save him?

76
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:47,320
This boy is my beloved precious subordinate.

77
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,645
My body... doesn't move.

78
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,443
You...!

79
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:58,749
What are you trying to do at place like this, huh?!

80
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,996
Hey, Naruto.

81
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:06,335
My body moves the same during the
Kagemane-no-jutsu (Shadow copying)

82
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,662
Oops. Sorry, Shikamaru.

83
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:18,483
What're you trying to do?

84
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,753
Choji! Feeling better?

85
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:24,606
Ah, Ino!

86
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,867
The time of Chubbies arrives!

87
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:47,796
What did you try to do to Gejimayu (Thick eyebrows)!

88
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:51,698
I was trying to kill him.

89
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,057
What?

90
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:56,028
How can he stay so calm...

91
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,488
even though his body can't move because of my Kagemane.

92
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,171
Why do you need to do such a thing?

93
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:10,591
You won the match. Do you have any personal grudge against him?

94
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,280
I don't have such a thing.

95
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:18,605
I'll kill him just because I want to do so.

96
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,901
What a selfish thing you're talking about!

97
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:27,166
I believe you didn't grow up in
normal way. You're extremely selfish.

98
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:32,607
Besides, he's a little strange... It's chilling me...

99
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,402
If he starts to do something, it's
too much for me and Naruto to handle.

100
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,916
Man... what should I do?

101
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:44,354
If you stand in my way, I'll kill you two, too.

102
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:47,161
What? Do it if you can!

103
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:48,596
Hey! Stop it, Naruto!

104
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,867
I guess I'll bluff a little to see how he reacts.

105
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:57,549
I know you're strong from watching the match with him.

106
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,350
But both me and him believe we can do good, too.

107
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:06,788
We still haven't shown you our "special moves" in the prelims.

108
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:11,189
Plus it's one against two. You got the disadvantage here.

109
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:15,567
If you listen to us, I won't mind
letting you leave without a scratch.

110
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:20,453
I'll tell you one more time. If you stand in my way...

111
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:21,522
I'll kill you.

112
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,833
This guy...

113
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,520
A guy like you can't kill me!

114
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,567
I'm telling you to stop that.

115
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:33,019
He's as strong as a monster. You know that, right?!

116
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:39,096
I have a real monster inside of
me. I won't lose to a guy like this.

117
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,138
Huh?

118
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,973
I came here because I heard Naruto is here... but...

119
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,286
It's so messy here.

120
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,626
I guess he's alright judging from this.

121
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,659
What are you doing rubbing him a wrong way, idiot!

122
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,471
A monster, huh?

123
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,947
The same here too.

124
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:27,597
As you said, I've not grown up in a normal way.

125
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:32,315
I was born by taking away the life
of whom I would've called my mother.

126
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:40,178
To be the strongest Shinobi, my father's
Ninjutsu made my body possessed by the Sand incarnation.

127
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,915
I'm a born monster.

128
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,173
The Sand incarnation?

129
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:54,658
It's called Shukaku... a wraith of Hidden Sand's
old priest, which was sealed in a teakettle.

130
00:14:56,774 --> 00:15:01,056
It's one of the Hyoui-no-Jutsu, to
have one possessed by spirits before birth.

131
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,165
To do that extent, it's crazy.

132
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:12,007
There's something inside of him, too?

133
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:20,296
Is that something a real parent would
do? It's a messed up way to show love.

134
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:22,393
Love?

135
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,527
Don't measure me with your stick.

136
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:33,224
Family... I'll tell you what that connection was for me.

137
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:38,287
It's just flesh that's connected with
hate and the intention to kill.

138
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:46,055
I was created as the village's best
creation with my mother's life as food,

139
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,723
As a son of Kazekage.

140
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:52,458
I grew up being taught the secrets of
shinobi, one after another, from father...

141
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,982
overprotectively indulged and left alone.

142
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:59,328
I believed that was love...

143
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,261
...until that incident happened.

144
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:07,752
That incident?

145
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,147
What was that, anyway?

146
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,882
What happened?!

147
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,612
For the last six years, since I was six years old...

148
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:31,425
my real father has been trying to assassinate me.

149
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:38,374
But you said you were indulged by your father.

150
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,103
What did that mean?

151
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,462
An existance that is too strong turns
into the existance that is to be feared.

152
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:54,623
My mind is unstable because I was born by a Jutsu.

153
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:59,935
The fools in the village finally realized
that there's a problem in me emotionally.

154
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:05,957
For my father, as Kagekage, I was the ace for the village...

155
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,965
but at the same time, I was dangerous object.

156
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:14,566
It seems that I was categorized as a
dangerous character around the time I turned six.

157
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,909
I was just treated carefully as the village's dangerous tool.

158
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,577
For them, I am a relic in the past that they want to erase.

159
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:29,756
Then, for what reason do I still exist and stay alive for...

160
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:33,282
When I thought that, I couldn't find the answer.

161
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,611
But a reason is needed while being alive.

162
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,585
Otherwise it is the same as being dead.

163
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,853
What is he talking about?

164
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,656
I can understand...

165
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:53,909
He is... the same as me.

166
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,751
And I concluded that...

167
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:01,582
I exist to kill everybody other than me.

168
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:07,428
I was finally relieved of the fear of
death that I could be assasinated anytime.

169
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:15,259
I was able to recognize the reason to
be alive was by killing assassins.

170
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,649
To fight only for myself and to live loving myself...

171
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,511
If I think all others exist to make me feel that...

172
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,903
then there's no other great world than this one.

173
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:36,289
As long as theres others who I should kill, and who
make me feel the joy of living in this world, exist...

174
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,710
my existance won't be erased.

175
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,567
What is this guy? He's seriously dangerous.

176
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,064
I was all alone, too.

177
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,623
I didn't know why I'm alive and it was painful...

178
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:57,577
but because Iruka-sensei recognized my existance,
I was able to feel that I was alive the first time.

179
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,907
On the other hand, this guy...

180
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,639
this guy is still all alone.

181
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:07,713
and he feels that he's alive by killing others?!

182
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,461
There's such a guy in this world?

183
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,199
The world he's living in is too different from mine!

184
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,819
There's no way I can win agaisnt such a guy!

185
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,449
What's wrong, Naruto?

186
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:44,675
What?  Kagemane-no-jutsu is
supposed to be sealing his moves.

187
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:53,747
Naruto! Hey! Be strong!

188
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,014
Man, you're troublesome.

189
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:00,082
Now, Let me feel it.

190
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:03,656
I guess it's over.

191
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,129
That's enough.

192
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:10,344
The real match is tomorrow. There's no need to hurry.

193
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:13,786
Or, do you want to stay here from today?

194
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,647
Please don't leave me alone.

195
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,427
No blood comes out, but I feel so much pain here...

196
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:27,453
What am I?

197
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,163
I will definitely kill you guys.

198
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:57,418
Wait for that moment.

199
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:40,733
Hey Konohamaru! What were you saying about your secret hand?!

200
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:45,135
I was late from the beginning! It's not even a
short cut and it's making me farther away from the arena!

201
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,652
The real match is going to start soon....

202
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:50,565
Anyways, hurry! hurry! hurry!

203
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:53,087
run, if i run, when i run, i'm gonna run

204
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:58,344
Next episode:
Fierce Moo-Chase Moo-Dash
Final exams begin!

205
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:02,273
I can't trust in your final hand at all.
