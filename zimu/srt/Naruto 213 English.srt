<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:33,759
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:39,630
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:45,731
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:51,336
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:58,018
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:04,992
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:17,631
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:29,243
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,201
Stop!

12
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,898
D-Don't push my father around!

13
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:26,003
You idiot, Fuki. Get out of here!

14
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:31,509
What're you hesitating for?
Take care of him quickly.

15
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:33,778
That's your job, right?

16
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,076
Get out of my way.

17
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:38,648
Fuki!

18
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,287
You've got something nice there.

19
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,088
I'll take that.

20
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,617
Please spare my daughter!

21
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:46,959
Like I care!

22
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,188
Father...

23
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,933
Father! Father!

24
00:02:58,706 --> 00:02:59,934
Stop it!

25
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:05,805
Y You jerk.

26
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:24,560
Here.

27
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:26,966
It's okay.

28
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:45,878
Look out!

29
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:04,869
Just a little more...
Just a little more, believe it.

30
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,102
<i>Rare menma pickled bamboo shoots?</i>

31
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,371
<i>Right. But only if I can get my hands</i>
<i>on it when it's in rare bamboo state.</i>

32
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:17,874
<i>It seems the rare bamboo only grows</i>
<i>on some ungodly cliff...</i>

33
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,646
<i>Then I'll get it, no matter what.</i>

34
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:24,288
<i>And then I'll eat some Ichiraku ramen</i>
<i>with the rare pickled bamboo shoots on top...</i>

35
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,350
<i>No matter what, believe it!</i>

36
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:29,930
Rare pickled bamboo shoots.

37
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:31,162
I did it!

38
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:37,634
I'm saved.

39
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:38,795
Huh?

40
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,170
What is that?

41
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,274
It's a person!

42
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:57,350
<i>Vanished Memories</i>

43
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,927
To think there'd be thunder
even though it's not raining...

44
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:08,629
It's kind of eerie.

45
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:16,839
You shouldn't shout like that...

46
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,401
This is a hospital.

47
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,344
You made me shout.

48
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,616
Huh? That white coat.

49
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:24,708
Could it be that you're helping out
the Medical Team, Sakura?

50
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,978
Isn't it lovely? I finally got the white coat.

51
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:32,186
I see. It's great that you were here
just at the right time.

52
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,719
I've got someone I'd like you
to take a look at.

53
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,491
Someone you want me
to take a look at?

54
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:39,130
It's him.

55
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,367
Wh What? Could that be Dozaemon...?

56
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,729
His name's Dozaemon, huh?

57
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,173
I didn't think he was
your acquaintance Sakura.

58
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,573
No. Dozaemon is a drowned body...

59
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,167
Oh, never mind...

60
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,638
I thought I knew him, but I was mistaken.

61
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,740
I see. Then I leave him to you.

62
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:59,286
Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.

63
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,614
So people outside of the village
can't be admitted.

64
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,316
Come on, just do this for me.

65
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,755
I've got other business to attend to.
So I leave the rest to you.

66
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:08,921
Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!

67
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,602
This is indeed the rare bamboo
I've heard about.

68
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,629
Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!

69
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:20,799
What're you talking about?

70
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:22,906
It takes three or four weeks to make

71
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:25,070
the pickled bamboo shoots
out of the rare bamboo.

72
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,305
What?!

73
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:30,378
First, I boil this
and then ferment it slowly.

74
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:33,554
What, I can't eat it right away?!

75
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,851
You need a degree of determination
to eat delicious things.

76
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:38,892
Naruto, so this is where you were.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,587
Hey, what's up with you?

78
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,725
What's up, nothing, you jerk...

79
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:43,923
Oww!

80
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,989
So you force a strange patient on me

81
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,262
and intend to eat ramen
by yourself at your leisure?

82
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:49,803
Ouch. That hurts.

83
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:02,107
Back to the Past Jutsu!

84
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,649
Oh, what's he doing there?

85
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,515
He's probing into his memory
from his subconscious.

86
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,659
That reverse hypnosis thing, huh?

87
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:15,588
Right.

88
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,523
Have you remembered anything?

89
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:24,764
I see.

90
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,772
It seems he's lost his memory.

91
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,407
Lost his memory?

92
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:33,273
Let's call it a day.
We'll do more tomorrow.

93
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,781
It seems he doesn't remember anything.

94
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:39,614
Not his name or address...

95
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,746
If none the doctor's Jutsu don't work,
then this is the real deal.

96
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,516
Then, doesn't he have something
we could use to identify him?

97
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,662
Nope... This is all he had.

98
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,066
What's this?

99
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,567
It's a dove flute, also called an ocarina.

100
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:59,398
Ocarina?

101
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,038
It's broken, though.

102
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,005
Oh, it looks like this will stick.

103
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:07,244
Not having memory could also
be a temporary state of shock...

104
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,777
Anyway, you sign this.

105
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:11,008
What's this?

106
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:12,550
A letter of undertaking.

107
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,852
I told you earlier,
but this is a Leaf hospital.

108
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,190
Outsiders aren't allowed.

109
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,084
If something were to happen,

110
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:22,152
you will take responsibility
for everything, Naruto.

111
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,322
What?!

112
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,125
You got a problem?

113
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:26,029
Fine, okay.

114
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,364
I sure picked up something troublesome.

115
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:04,938
What's going on?!

116
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,231
That's in the direction of the hospital!

117
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,177
Everyone, it'll be okay.
Please evacuate calmly.

118
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,867
<i>Help me!</i>

119
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,281
Forgive me... Forgive me.

120
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,917
Is there anyone left?

121
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,649
Anyone here?

122
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,362
Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?

123
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,224
I'm checking right now.

124
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,098
Hey, Sakura!

125
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:09,897
Naruto.

126
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:11,336
Everything okay?

127
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,394
Somehow.

128
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,105
Hey, where is that guy?

129
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:14,698
What?

130
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:16,138
Come to think of it...

131
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,009
He's not here.

132
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,008
Please help! My baby is...
My baby is still inside!

133
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:26,320
What did you say?!

134
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:30,487
No way. It doesn't look like
we can get in with these flames...

135
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,817
What're you doing?!
Hurry up and put out the fire!

136
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:02,484
I'll go in!

137
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:03,420
That's reckless.

138
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:06,016
The baby is in the deepest part
of the hospital.

139
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:11,624
What?

140
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,089
It's the sound of a flute.

141
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:16,097
It's him!

142
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:18,702
He's getting closer.

143
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,270
Here he comes!

144
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,707
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

145
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,379
- This way!
- To the right.

146
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,550
He did it! The baby is with him, too!

147
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:32,780
All right!

148
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:33,876
My boy!

149
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:35,980
That was a close shave.

150
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:37,914
Thank goodness!

151
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:40,492
Thank you very much... Thank you!

152
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:41,789
Sure.

153
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,497
Thank you so much.

154
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,235
An outsider with amnesia, huh?

155
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,975
Good grief. What a dilemma.

156
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,975
It'd be okay just to let
that one guy stay, right?

157
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,343
We can't do that.

158
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,040
For the safety of the village,

159
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:06,882
we must not overlook even
the slightest thing.

160
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,045
But, we figured out that

161
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:11,785
he's not a bad guy
after that incident, right?

162
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,919
Unfortunately, we must not let someone
whose identity we don't know

163
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,326
stay in the village.

164
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,024
Then, if he were to do something,

165
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:19,963
I'll take the responsibility
and figure something out.

166
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:24,160
Sakura, how's he doing?
Has he remembered anything?

167
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,699
No, nothing yet.

168
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,402
I see.

169
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,544
I'm begging you.
I'll let you guys have some of

170
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:34,308
the rare pickled bamboo
shoot ramen too, Grandma.

171
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:36,809
Rare... pickled bamboo shoots?

172
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:40,714
Yeah. I went to pick some on
the way back from a mission

173
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,847
and then found him!

174
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:45,155
That's news to me.

175
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,826
So you were loitering around like
that on your way back from a mission?

176
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,091
Ouch. Oww.

177
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:56,134
Naruto, so you're serious about
looking after that boy, huh?

178
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,834
Yeah, it's true.

179
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:02,638
All right, then I'll let that boy
remain in the village.

180
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:04,001
Lady Tsunade!

181
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:08,039
I can't run out the person
who saved a child from this village.

182
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:11,614
Excellent, Grandma.
Now you're talking!

183
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:17,655
I'm Naruto Uzumaki...
Nice to know you.

184
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,958
I I'm...

185
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:24,495
Oh, that's right.
Your memory hasn't come back yet.

186
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,895
Then, hmmm.

187
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,299
Menma, make it Menma.

188
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:31,933
Menma?

189
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:35,098
Yeah. I'd gone to pick some
and then I found you, so...

190
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:36,871
Menma...

191
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:40,938
Okay, got it. My name's Menma.

192
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:43,112
It's settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.

193
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:45,242
Good to meet you, Naruto.

194
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:46,877
Here you go.

195
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,787
Wow, it looks delicious.

196
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,590
The ramen here is the best
in the world, believe it.

197
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,787
Let's eat.

198
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,965
Tasty.

199
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,564
But this isn't the finished product.
Don't you notice something lacking?

200
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:08,601
Huh?

201
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,472
Oh.

202
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:13,436
Come to think of it, there isn't
any menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.

203
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:16,414
Right. Until the rare pickled
bamboo shoots are ready,

204
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:18,974
they're sealed from your ramen.

205
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,845
Hey, old man, you'll be
sure to make it, right?

206
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,354
Absolutely.

207
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,618
I can't wait. Say, Menma.

208
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,657
Let's definitely come here together
to have some at that time.

209
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:30,525
Right.

210
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,962
Okay, come on in.

211
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:36,200
Excuse me for barging in.

212
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:39,228
As of today, this is your home.

213
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:42,339
It's a dirty place,
but make yourself comfortable.

214
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:43,710
Whoa.

215
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,407
It really is dirty.

216
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:49,882
Don't get so hung up on the details.

217
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,041
Y You're right.

218
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:54,480
More importantly, let's get to sleep and

219
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:58,047
starting tomorrow we'll come up with
a way to get your memory back.

220
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:58,982
Right.

221
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,762
I can't eat anymore...

222
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:27,915
Man, I slept well!

223
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:29,583
Morning, Naruto.

224
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,447
Menma?

225
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:34,985
Whoa.

226
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,858
Everything's been cleaned up nicely!

227
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,096
Did you do this?

228
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,999
Yeah. I couldn't sleep and
had time to kill.

229
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,069
Thanks for that...

230
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,373
Hey, Menma! What're you doing

231
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:54,240
What do you mean?
I'm hanging up the laundry.

232
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,150
Don't wash someone else's underwear!

233
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,579
I'll do that myself,
so don't worry about it!

234
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,984
Really?

235
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:09,558
Now then...
How should w e get your memory back?

236
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,955
Oh, I know!

237
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:13,799
Come with me, Menma.

238
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,971
This is a specialty from the Land of Wind,
Sand Dumplings.

239
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,477
This fine soy powder is used to
resemble sand and they taste really good.

240
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:26,780
Yeah?

241
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,811
And this one is a specialty from
the Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.

242
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,408
The crunchy texture is irresistible.

243
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:33,475
Uh huh.

244
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:37,455
And this is a specialty from
the Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.

245
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,719
So? Have you remembered anything?

246
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,823
No... Nothing at all.

247
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:45,155
Oh, I thought you might
remember something

248
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,757
if they had a specialty
from your home.

249
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:48,659
Sorry.

250
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:50,670
No need to apologize.

251
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:55,500
Naruto, forget about my memory.

252
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:56,737
What?

253
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:01,475
You see, we don't know how
or when my memory will come back.

254
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,752
More importantly,
you've got your own work, right?

255
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,376
Well, you've got a point.

256
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,655
I've got to finish cleaning
the Great Stone Faces by today...

257
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,248
Then let's do that.

258
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,392
But before that, wait just a minute.

259
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:17,558
Huh?

260
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:18,991
Hey, Menma.

261
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:21,293
Ma'am...

262
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,170
I'll carry your things
to your house.

263
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:27,398
Oh, thank you.

264
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:38,042
Thank you very much.

265
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,482
No problem.

266
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:43,855
At any rate, you've sure got
a lot of weeds growing in your yard.

267
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,820
My lower back has been
bothering me lately...

268
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:50,386
The grass grows as much as it wants.

269
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,460
Then I'll do it.

270
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:53,825
Oh, my.

271
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,662
I I will, too!

272
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,803
Thanks so much!

273
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,403
Phew... Finally done!

274
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:05,543
Naruto.

275
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,668
What is it?

276
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:08,139
They want help too!

277
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:08,941
Huh?

278
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,783
It seems this area here
is all homes of the elderly.

279
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:14,454
Thanks.

280
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,480
I leave it to you.

281
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,623
F-For real?

282
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:22,926
What's this?

283
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:26,462
Actually, thank you gifts have
been sent to Naruto and that boy

284
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,160
from all over the village.

285
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:31,028
What're those two doing?

286
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,866
But really, you're sure an odd guy.

287
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:38,008
Am I?

288
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,604
You've got a strong
sense of righteousness,

289
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,342
I mean,
you're the embodiment of kindness.

290
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,844
It's not something easily done.

291
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:47,520
I just want to live right.

292
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,682
I don't want to have any more regrets.

293
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:54,252
Hm? Menma,
have you remembered something?

294
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:56,123
Huh? No, not really.

295
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:57,589
I see.

296
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:01,096
What?! Is it bird poop?

297
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:03,832
It's blood!

298
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,071
Give me a hand, Menma!

299
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,139
Right!

300
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,976
What's the matter?!

301
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:20,009
Someone... in this village...

302
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:23,553
Let's get out of here!

303
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,159
Menma, I leave this guy to you.

304
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,053
Got it.

305
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:38,927
Damn it!

306
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:46,169
Damn you. Come on out!

307
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,682
Damn it! Where's he hiding?

308
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,083
Naruto...

309
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:10,503
Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!

310
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,773
Huh? What's this?

311
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,539
Awesome power's starting to
well up in my whole body.

312
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,946
All right.

313
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,385
Awesome!

314
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,020
Power's flowing over me!

315
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:39,764
I see you.

316
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:43,134
Damn it.

317
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:51,406
I did it.

318
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:55,815
It's a Substitution!

319
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,547
Damn it. He got away, huh?

320
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,956
You okay, Naruto?

321
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:05,516
Menma...

322
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:07,521
That flute just now...

323
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:12,455
Who in the world are you?

324
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:23,640
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

325
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,979
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

326
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:39,789
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

327
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,388
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

328
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:49,333
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

329
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:54,204
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

330
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:59,177
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

331
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:03,410
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

332
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:07,886
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

333
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:15,292
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

334
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:19,196
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

335
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:24,465
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

336
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,599
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

337
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:33,476
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

338
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:38,173
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

339
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:44,315
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

340
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:52,895
As I thought, he's no ordinary man.

341
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:55,093
He won't be an easy opponent to fight.

342
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:56,362
Wait a minute.

343
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,994
You are talking about Menma
like his our enemy or something.

344
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,595
There is that possibility, you know.

345
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,640
He could be with the intruder
from the other day.

346
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,834
What are you talking about?

347
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:06,044
Weren't you two gonna help us
seek Menma's memory together?

348
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,773
Our mission is to find out
the guy's identity

349
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:09,975
and to catch the intruder.

350
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,176
Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

351
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,280
Next time: "Bringing Back Reality"
