1
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:16,828
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,424
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:26,265
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,536
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:40,116
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:45,491
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:49,085
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,464
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:55,467
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:59,835
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,303
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:08,177
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:11,918
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,121
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:21,387
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,929
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:27,364
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,737
Sasuke!

21
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,440
You punk!

22
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,218
<i>What's with... this guy?</i>

23
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,125
<i>Why...?</i>

24
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:31,725
<i>Damn it...</i>

25
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,092
Is this the best you've got?

26
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:43,102
If this is all you've got,
I still don't need to use that...

27
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:44,534
What?

28
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:50,946
You haven't realized it?
I... haven't used my Sharingan.

29
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,381
Don't mock me!

30
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:03,054
You don't have enough strength
or desire...

31
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,999
<i>You are weak.</i>

32
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:14,636
<i>Why you are weak?</i>
<i>Because you don't have enough... hatred.</i>

33
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,769
If I kept playing comrade with you guys...

34
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,945
I wouldn't have... been able to get...

35
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,789
...this much power!

36
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:45,034
That's right... I need...

37
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:51,902
Both power... and hatred...
in order to catch up with him.

38
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,679
<i>Brothers.</i>
<i>Distance Among the Uchiha</i>

39
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,417
Big Brother... I'll get off.

40
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,655
Don't push it...

41
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,293
Okay...

42
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,824
Oh...

43
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,128
What's up?

44
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,835
This is the place...
where Father works, right?

45
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,006
Yeah... The headquarters
of the Leaf Police Force.

46
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,769
I was curious about it from before,

47
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:28,473
but why's the Uchiha Clan crest
on the Police Force mark?

48
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,343
Oh... so you noticed, huh?

49
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,312
Of course...

50
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,512
Yeah... Let me see...
To put it simply...

51
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,185
it seems the previous generations
of the Uchiha Clan

52
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,161
set up and established the Police Force.

53
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:49,800
So they used their own crest for
the symbol mark of this organization.

54
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,837
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has always been

55
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:55,772
in charge of protecting
the public and the peace of this village.

56
00:04:56,542 --> 00:05:00,945
The Uchiha crest is
a testament to the proud clan.

57
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:05,307
The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.

58
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:09,986
But even now, nearly all members
belong to this first force here.

59
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,524
And contribute to maintaining
peace in the village.

60
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:16,795
Only even more exceptional Shinobi
can crack down on the crimes

61
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:19,423
committed by Shinobi, so...

62
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,901
Sure enough, father's awesome!

63
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,766
Leaf Police Force
Are you going to enter
the Police Force, too?

64
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,435
Well... I'm not sure...

65
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,734
Why not?!

66
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,543
When I grow up, I'm also going
to enter the Police Force, so!

67
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,509
Father's also coming to
tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

68
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,681
It's the first step to my dream.

69
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:42,951
That's right.

70
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,624
You're late... What were you doing?

71
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,459
Father...

72
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,533
I have something to talk to you about.
Come quickly.

73
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,870
That's my boy.

74
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,809
You've come this far just half a year
after being promoted to Chunin.

75
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,418
About tomorrow's special mission...

76
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,690
I've decided to go with you, too.

77
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:20,756
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

78
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:24,726
If you complete this mission, Itachi...

79
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,295
your entrance into
the Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!

80
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,598
You understand, right?

81
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:39,710
You don't have to be so worried.
More importantly...

82
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,976
Umm... Father...

83
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,407
Tomorrow's my...

84
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,882
Tomorrow's mission will be
a very important mission not just for you,

85
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,720
but for the Uchiha Clan!

86
00:06:58,097 --> 00:07:01,157
I'm quitting tomorrow's mission, after all.

87
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,199
What're you doing talking insanity?!

88
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:08,601
You should know how important
a day tomorrow is!

89
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:15,439
I'm going to Sasuke's Academy
entrance ceremony tomorrow...

90
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,746
The general rule is for relatives
to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.

91
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:25,185
There was the notice, right... Father?

92
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,523
I get it already.

93
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,460
I'll go to the Academy...

94
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,030
Your left leg...

95
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,765
Be sure to ice it.

96
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:42,436
Right...

97
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,843
<i>Big Brother... He's so distant...</i>

98
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,210
Entrance Ceremony

99
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,355
Everyone! Congratulations
on your entrance!

100
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:03,759
From here on, please work very hard
towards striving for the Shinobi path.

101
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:08,930
And I'd like you to bring further prosperity
to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.

102
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:17,275
Gee... I remember
the time when Itachi entered.

103
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,668
Just what I'd expect from his brother.

104
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,914
Thank you for your help with both boys.

105
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,150
Oh, it's nothing like that.

106
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,586
The first prodigy since the beginning
of the Academy...

107
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:32,815
There were no students
as exceptional as that boy.

108
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,490
That's a bit too much praise.

109
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:36,823
Not at all...

110
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,456
I'm hopeful for you, too.

111
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,730
Become a fine Shinobi
like your big brother.

112
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:46,939
Yes.

113
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,809
Hey... That's Uchiha, right?

114
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:56,343
Yeah.

115
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,713
I wonder... if he's awesome, too.

116
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,345
Hmm... Must be.

117
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:08,787
Recess at last! What a drag.
I'm still not used to this place...

118
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:10,585
You want some too, Shikamaru?

119
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:14,895
I mean, all of your recesses
have become meal times.

120
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,217
That's my boy...

121
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,617
I've great confidence
you'll make it great in Anbu.

122
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,821
This won't do!

123
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,460
Won't do!

124
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,942
I've got a long way... to go...

125
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,719
Really...

126
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:11,583
You should rest your body
on your days off at least.

127
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,617
You don't have to push it.

128
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:19,890
I heard... that Big Brother graduated
from the Academy in just one year.

129
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,060
The times are different, then and now.

130
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:27,873
Besides, that kid is a bit special, so...

131
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,575
<i>That's my boy...</i>

132
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:42,513
<i>Now, I'm going to hand out</i>
<i>the report cards for the first half.</i>

133
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,651
Taijutsu: 1 st in class and academy
Ninjutsu: 1 st in class and academy
Individual rank: 1 st in class and academy
Team rank: 1 st in class and academy

134
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:59,004
Do a fine job in this vein like
your big brother.

135
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:16,018
<i>Father... I wanted you to say,</i>
<i>"That's my boy," to me...</i>

136
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,382
What did you say?

137
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,219
What do you mean you can't participate
in the assembly tomorrow?!

138
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,529
You don't understand your own position!

139
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm setting out on a mission tomorrow.

140
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,936
<i>What're they doing this late</i>
<i>at night with the lights off?</i>

141
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,738
What mission?!

142
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,473
I can't say...
It's a top secret mission.

143
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:54,452
Itachi... You also have the role
of the pipe which connects the clan

144
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,324
with the keystone of the village.

145
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,359
You know that, don't you?

146
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:00,928
Yeah...

147
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:06,771
Keep that well in mind!
And come to tomorrow's assembly!

148
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:11,873
Sasuke...

149
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,477
Get to bed after
you've gone to the bathroom.

150
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:17,740
Right...

151
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,912
What're you doing hanging around
this late at night?

152
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,413
Get to bed!

153
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:23,816
Okay.

154
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,622
Report Card

155
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,800
Father only thinks about you, Big Brother...

156
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,797
Am I loathsome to you?

157
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,075
It's okay.

158
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:50,072
It's logical for Shinobi to be
ill thought of by people, so...

159
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:52,082
That's not how I feel...

160
00:12:54,587 --> 00:13:00,287
<i>Brother's right.</i>
<i>I really do... think ill of him...</i>

161
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:05,157
Excellence is not easy at all.

162
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:09,523
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant.

163
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:13,396
Even if you're coveted
and sought after at first.

164
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:17,442
But, we only have each other
for siblings.

165
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,109
I will continue to exist with you
as a wall you must get over...

166
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,178
Even if I'm ill-thought of...
That's what a big brother is.

167
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,287
Is Itachi home?!

168
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,287
I have something to
talk to you about. Come out!

169
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,629
Why's everyone gathered here?

170
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,193
There are two people who didn't come
to yesterday's assembly.

171
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,634
Why didn't you come?!

172
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:53,075
<i>He didn't go to the assembly Father</i>
<i>was talking about last night, after all.</i>

173
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,246
I understand that when you enter Anbu,

174
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,545
you get roped into various
troublesome things.

175
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,814
Your father also said something
like that in your defense.

176
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,419
But for us, we don't intend
to treat you special.

177
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,796
Understood. I shall be careful next time.

178
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,390
Now I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

179
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:20,405
Right... But before that,
there's a little more I want to ask you...

180
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:28,244
It's about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself
into the Nakano River to kill himself.

181
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,970
<i>Threw himself?!</i>

182
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,948
The other person who didn't come
to the assembly is that Shisui.

183
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,353
As I recall, you adored him
like a real older brother.

184
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:45,623
I see... I hadn't seen him at all recently.

185
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,023
That's too bad.

186
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:58,867
And we the Police Force have decided
to launch an all-out investigation.

187
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,402
Investigation?!

188
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,576
This is the will Shisui wrote.

189
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,975
The analysis of the handwriting
has been completed.

190
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,713
No mistake, he did indeed write it.

191
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,558
If there are no murder leads,
then what's the investigation?

192
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:18,925
It'd be easy for a person who can use
Sharingan to copy handwriting, you see...

193
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,532
The most adept Uchiha.

194
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,565
The man feared as Shisui,
"the Instantaneous Man.

195
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,965
He was a man who would take
the lead no matter what the mission

196
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,601
if it was for the sake of the clan.

197
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,342
It's tough to think that

198
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:37,780
such a man would leave something
like this and kill himself.

199
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:42,451
You shouldn't judge people...
only on looks and speculation.

200
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:46,152
For the time being,
I leave the will with you.

201
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:51,486
Take that and you request cooperation
in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.

202
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,290
Understood...

203
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,601
I hope we get a lead.

204
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:02,797
A Iso, we have a different route
to Anbu Black Ops.

205
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:07,406
We'll know right away if you do something
like crushing the investigation request.

206
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,984
Why don't you just come right out
and say it?

207
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,279
You suspect me, right?

208
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:21,387
Yeah. That's right, you little punk...

209
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:22,989
Listen up, Itachi.

210
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:26,056
Just try doing something
like betraying the clan and...

211
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,994
it'll cost you!

212
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:38,901
I told you before.

213
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:43,512
You shouldn't judge people...
only on looks and speculation.

214
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,512
It's because you take the liberty to
judge me as patient and take me lightly.

215
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:51,012
Clan... Clan...

216
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:55,457
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own vessels

217
00:16:55,527 --> 00:17:00,760
and don't know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there...

218
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,591
<i>I've never seen him like this...</i>

219
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:08,634
Shisui... was monitoring you recently...

220
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,166
Half a year after entering Anbu...

221
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:16,340
the strangeness of your behavior
couldn't be overlooked.

222
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,846
What the hell are you thinking?

223
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,817
Fixated on the organization,

224
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,981
fixated on the clan,
fixated on the name.

225
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:30,454
It's a dreadful thing that constrains oneself
and labels one's own vessel.

226
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,092
And it's a foolish thing...

227
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:36,931
that fear and hate...
what one has never seen or known...

228
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,263
Stop, Itachi!

229
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:41,300
What the hell's the matter
with you?!

230
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,909
Itachi...
You've been a little strange lately.

231
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,773
I'm not strange at all.

232
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,984
I'm carrying out my own role...
That's it.

233
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,984
Then why didn't you come last night?

234
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,515
In order to elevate myself higher...

235
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:02,685
What're you talking about?

236
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,940
My vessel is dismayed
at this foolish clan!

237
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,203
<i>From olden times,</i>
<i>the Uchiha Clan has all along</i>

238
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,044
<i>been in charge protecting</i>
<i>the peace of this village.</i>

239
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:29,545
<i>The Uchiha crest is a testament</i>
<i>to the proud clan.</i>

240
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,254
<i>That's my boy...</i>

241
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,960
<i>I've great confidence</i>
<i>you'll do great in Anbu Black Ops.</i>

242
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:40,228
Because you're fixated
on insignificant things like clans...

243
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,893
you lose sight of what's truly important.

244
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:47,197
True change cannot be made if stuck
within the restrictions of regulations,

245
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:50,639
and constrained predictions
and imagination...

246
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,006
Saying such arrogant things!

247
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:57,477
Enough! You'll be imprisoned
if you say any more foolish nonsense.

248
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:02,679
<i>Excellence is not easy at all.</i>

249
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,990
<i>If you have power,</i>
<i>you become alienated and also arrogant...</i>

250
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,057
<i>even if you're coveted</i>
<i>and sought after at first...</i>

251
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:14,630
<i>Why... Big Brother?</i>

252
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,228
What do you say?!

253
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:22,029
I can't tolerate it anymore...
Captain, order imprisonment!

254
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:24,834
Big Brother! Stop it already!

255
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,719
I'm not the one who killed Shisui.

256
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,424
But I apologize for
my numerous slips of the tongue.

257
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm very sorry...

258
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:50,665
Recently, it seems he's been up
to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions

259
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,431
and was a little tired...

260
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:53,698
Captain!

261
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:57,072
The Anbu Black Ops is a force
under the direct control of Lord Hokage...

262
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:01,910
Even we the Police Force can't arrest him,
if we don't have an arrest warrant.

263
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,843
And as for Itachi...

264
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:09,116
I will take the responsibility
and monitor him.

265
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:11,316
Please...

266
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:17,860
Understood...

267
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:51,956
With this, you've woken up, right?

268
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,760
We had a hindrance back at that time...

269
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,200
But it won't be like that this time.

270
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:10,140
I'll show you...
the true power of Sharingan.

271
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:28,897
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

272
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:35,270
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

273
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:45,841
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

274
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:55,617
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

275
00:21:57,362 --> 00:22:02,356
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

276
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:11,667
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

277
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:23,379
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

278
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:33,822
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

279
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:46,576
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

280
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:54,152
Give me all you've got,
Naruto.

281
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,187
Or is this all you've got?

282
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,989
You were talking impudently
about your Way of Ninja

283
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,689
and this is all you've got?

284
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:11,536
You've gotta be kidding! Right now,
you're not even worth beating!

285
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:15,234
Next episode:
"Father and Son, the Broken Crest"
