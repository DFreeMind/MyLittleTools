1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:03,792
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,627
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:12,729
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:29,188
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:37,322
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:57,041
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:02,487
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:07,891
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,055
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:19,869
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,750
So it's a case of not being able to fight
with the leader

16
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,482
unless I defeat the underlings?

17
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,755
Well then!

18
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:18,024
<i>Hot Blooded Confrontation.</i>
<i>Student vs. Sensei</i>

19
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,993
So you think you've blackened the path
to this Might Guy's tomorrow with this?

20
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:28,671
Youth is breaking through
the walls that close you in...

21
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,875
If you have both passion and effort,
then nothing is impossible!

22
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,537
With our sights trained on tomorrow...!

23
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:42,287
Is there no tomorrow for us...?

24
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:45,923
<i>So this wood retains</i>
<i>its incredible strength</i>

25
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:49,223
<i>because it is reinforced and</i>
<i>connected by Chakra, I see.</i>

26
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:52,323
Guy Sensei...

27
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:53,757
Yagura?

28
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,191
Are you all right?!

29
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,139
I'm not Yagura...

30
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,472
Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,
Gensho!

31
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,775
Second son of the same, Rokkaku!

32
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,313
Third son, Jako!

33
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,318
Ryudouin?

34
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:20,787
Hmm... I think I've heard
of that somewhere...

35
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,594
Don't tell me that you don't remember!

36
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,030
Our father, Agira Ryudouin,
was deeply injured

37
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:31,502
by the cowardly strategies of you
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

38
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:36,502
And unable to execute his missions,
he passed away in despair.

39
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,002
Our father resented you to the very end,

40
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,946
even muttering your name
on his deathbed...

41
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,852
telling us to fight with
Might Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.

42
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,320
From that day forth,

43
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:52,324
our objective
has been to avenge his death!

44
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:56,952
Yes! We have been lying in wait for
the time when we could get even with you!

45
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,430
Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!

46
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:04,434
There's no way I could forget that battle.

47
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:08,763
Although we were enemies
on our missions, Agira was a fine man...

48
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:12,770
That will remain in my memory as
a splendid contest, even within

49
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,779
the annals of
the complete eight-volume

50
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,371
"Might Guy's History of Famous Battles."

51
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,349
It was a man to man fight.

52
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,295
Nothing happened that dishonored
my Way of Ninja!

53
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,892
You three must be mistaken.

54
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,868
I won't be angry at you,
so let me out of here!

55
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,039
Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon
you to settle my father's score...

56
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:43,632
I'll finish you off!

57
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,432
Sakura...

58
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,295
I noticed you were there some time ago.

59
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,403
My master told me to
make sure you don't overdo it.

60
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,564
You're hiding something, aren't you?!

61
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,337
N -No... Nothing!

62
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,582
Sakura, you're not very good at lying...

63
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:30,787
What?

64
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:42,060
Die, Might Guy!
Enemy of our father!

65
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,802
Wait, I tell you!

66
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:51,975
Hey, you Yagura imposter.
Infiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,

67
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,705
what are you scheming?!

68
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,011
Byakugan!

69
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,017
Guy is in that building!
The building is controlled by their Chakra!

70
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:07,683
Why you!

71
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:22,640
Intense Brow Sensei,
I'm coming to your rescue!

72
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,045
Wh What is this?!

73
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:36,049
Do you intend to shut us in
with these pieces of wood?

74
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:39,315
Don't underestimate us!

75
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,154
Stop it, Naruto!

76
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,002
Wooden Dummies for training?

77
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,575
Are these also controlled by those three?

78
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,373
However strong they are,

79
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:05,246
they couldn't move all of
these Wooden Dummies at once.

80
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:09,212
It's hard to believe those three would
have that much power.

81
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,184
Byakugan!

82
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,388
I see.

83
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,189
They have a simple mechanism,

84
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:24,464
and their movements are controlled by
the labels stuck to the back of their heads.

85
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,965
So, they're not moved with Puppet Jutsu?

86
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,876
No, they're only designed for
repeated punches and kicks,

87
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,070
so they probably cannot respond
to our movements!

88
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,978
Does this mean their movements
can be halted by removing the labels?

89
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,707
So that's what it's all about!

90
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,417
If that's the case,
then I'll return that blow!

91
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,746
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

92
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,294
Here goes!

93
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:05,342
Once I know the weak spot,
you're all mine!

94
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,181
- Gotcha!
- Gotcha!

95
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,056
Hah! This is easy!

96
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,926
These Wooden Dummies are
just one small part of our Jutsu!

97
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,898
Ninja Art:
Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!

98
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:43,614
Damn you!

99
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,017
Keep your wits about you!

100
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,884
There's one that moves differently
from the others!

101
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,792
Neji!

102
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,966
U zu ma ki...

103
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,935
Naruto Barra...!

104
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:13,136
Stay back!

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,572
Some of these Wooden Dummies seem
to be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.

106
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,810
Be careful!

107
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,463
- Lee!
- Bushy Brow!

108
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,470
Leaf Hurricane!

109
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:46,843
Lee?!

110
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,172
How did you know we were here?!

111
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,939
From what Sakura told us,

112
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,178
I felt certain that Guy Sensei
would take this route

113
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,743
if he were headed for
the Land of Mountain Streams.

114
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:58,251
And where is Guy Sensei?

115
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,783
Inside there.

116
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:14,837
What?

117
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,340
A Are they running away?

118
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,878
What's happening?!

119
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:46,368
It's just like a castle!

120
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,162
Leave this to me!

121
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:54,238
Guy Sensei is my master!
I would risk my life to save him!

122
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:58,144
But, Bushy Brow,
your leg injury hasn't healed yet.

123
00:10:58,718 --> 00:10:59,912
I'm going in!

124
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,447
It's reckless!

125
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:07,282
Do you intend to interfere?

126
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,985
Today, I am just
a bit different from usual!

127
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,361
Bushy Brow, we'll cover you.

128
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:18,428
There is a weak point in
the Chakra at the center of the castle.

129
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:19,798
If you hit there, then...

130
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,897
But it may be a trap!

131
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:27,635
Everyone... If it is a trap,
let's try falling into it intentionally.

132
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:36,680
Over there!

133
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,756
Dynamic Entry!

134
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,762
As we suspected,
it was a trap to lure me in.

135
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,233
Anyway, let's follow it through.

136
00:11:56,742 --> 00:12:00,872
Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.

137
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:02,345
All right.

138
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:06,040
Take revenge on that coward
by a suitable method.

139
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,585
Leave it to me...

140
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:13,088
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!

141
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,435
A Wooden Dummy here too?

142
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,637
<i>Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee...</i>

143
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:32,140
Is that Yagura's voice I hear?

144
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,109
<i>I'll teach you both,</i>
<i>master and student,</i>

145
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,378
<i>that sometimes passion and</i>
<i>effort alone come to naught.</i>

146
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,878
I won't allow you to
speak ill of my teacher.

147
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,113
If you've got something to say,

148
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,815
then why don't you come out here
and say it?

149
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,456
<i>There is no need.</i>

150
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:49,085
<i>I can amply prove it with</i>
<i>the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.</i>

151
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,553
I have come to rescue my teacher!

152
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:54,492
There's no way
I'm going to let myself lose to you!

153
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,725
<i>You make me laugh...</i>

154
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,669
What's this? The Leaf Hurricane...?

155
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:06,307
Does this mean that the technique
I deployed that time

156
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:09,040
has been completely imitated
and mastered by Yagura?!

157
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,848
In that case...

158
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,216
Leaf's Severe Hurricane!

159
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,024
<i>Can this really be Yagura?</i>

160
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:23,893
<i>If he's mastered not</i>
<i>only offensive moves,</i>

161
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,488
<i>but also learned to guard with</i>
<i>such perfection</i>

162
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,430
<i>then he truly must be a genius!</i>

163
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,936
<i>What an incredibly</i>
<i>powerful spinning kick...</i>

164
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>The Gensho I faced off with</i>
<i>in the practice hall</i>

165
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:34,836
<i>did not have this much power.</i>

166
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:36,773
<i>To my knowledge,</i>

167
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:40,369
<i>there is only one person who</i>
<i>could let loose this powerful a kick.</i>

168
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:44,346
They are student and teacher
who respect each other.

169
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,316
Dying in fighting each other must
be a wish come true.

170
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,716
We'll have them crush each other

171
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,913
with Wooden Dummies mimicking
each other's movements.

172
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:54,353
Even if each were to discover
the true identity of his opponent...

173
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,287
They can't escape from the confrontation

174
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,763
without defeating
the Wooden Dummies before their eyes.

175
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,958
That is the secret of

176
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,502
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!

177
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,009
<i>Looks like my legs</i>
<i>can't last for very long...</i>

178
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,176
<i>If it comes to this,</i>
<i>there's only one move left.</i>

179
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,309
<i>Guy Sensei, it's okay right?</i>

180
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,949
<i>If I use it for your sake,</i>
<i>you'll probably forgive me.</i>

181
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,151
The Lotus?

182
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:32,694
Could it be that the one who is controlling
this Wooden Dummy is Lee?

183
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,234
Dancing L eaf Shadow!

184
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:56,151
<i>A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back</i>
<i>to aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!</i>

185
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,925
<i>It's magnificent...</i>
<i>Too magnificent!</i>

186
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:04,394
<i>Only Guy Sensei could use</i>
<i>such artful techniques!</i>

187
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,</i>

188
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:10,227
<i>I'm 100% certain that he would have</i>
<i>toppled the opponent with that Lotus.</i>

189
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,607
<i>But, at this rate,</i>
<i>I won't be able to beat this Jutsu...</i>

190
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,403
Wait! There is a way.

191
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:35,484
<i>That tapping is Morse Code.</i>
<i>"You and I are destroying each other..."</i>

192
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,358
But there's no way for either
of us to end this fight

193
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:40,989
without defeating the enemy's Jutsu...

194
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,665
So, it was Guy Sensei that
I was fighting all along?

195
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,830
We must both create an attack
with speed and power

196
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,308
of a magnitude that cannot be
reproduced by the Wooden Dummies...

197
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:57,379
"But I cannot show to you
the abyss of death again!

198
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:08,655
<i>Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person</i>
<i>who is most important to me...</i>

199
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,961
"You will forgive me for using
that move, won't you?"

200
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:17,793
"To me..."
"To me..."

201
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,035
"To me, there is no one more important
than Guy Sensei, you say?

202
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,880
Lee! What do you mean by
making me cry at a time like this?

203
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:36,852
Lee! I haven't forgotten the promise
I made to you back then!

204
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:44,093
"If you die... I shall die with you."

205
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,094
Thank you, Guy Sensei!

206
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,627
Now is the very time when...

207
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:54,572
one's own Way of Ninja...

208
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,334
- must be followed to the very end!
- Must be followed to the very end!

209
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,674
Third Gate: Gate of Life... Open!

210
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,107
Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain... Open!

211
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,759
Guy Sensei!

212
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:17,861
We're far from finished!

213
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,505
What's wrong, Elder Brother?

214
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,673
They're fast. They're both too fast...

215
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:39,883
At this rate,
the Wooden Dummies will... break.

216
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,280
Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!

217
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,184
Open!

218
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:49,853
I can't see them.
They're faster even than sound!

219
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,167
There you go, Lee!

220
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,709
Bring the Chakra of your passions
to bear upon your opponent!

221
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,832
Right!

222
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,386
- The castle is...
...crumbling?

223
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:14,976
If this was revenge,

224
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,675
then why did you not come at me
with the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?

225
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:24,583
That day, though he was
the only man left,

226
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,920
your father refused to surrender,

227
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:29,961
but fairly and sportingly confronted me
with Kung Fu.

228
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:38,792
Out of respect to your father,
I faced him one to one.

229
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:43,333
When the fight was finished,
your father smiled slightly,

230
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:45,876
as if satisfied, and said he would like
to fight again...

231
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:58,517
Whether or not you believe me,
this is all there was to it.

232
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:04,522
Could it be that
what Father wanted to say

233
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:07,463
was not that he wanted us
to defeat Master Guy,

234
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:10,968
but that he wanted to fight again,
fairly and squarely?

235
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:15,298
Have we had the wrong idea all along?

236
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:19,537
I learned something important from
your father in that fight.

237
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:24,075
It is not the people born with
natural gifts who are the lucky ones;

238
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:27,946
the truly fortunate are they who,
believing in themselves to the very end,

239
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,114
can go on striving and keep the flame
of their passions alive because of it.

240
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,459
Uh huh.
That's a good teacher student relationship.

241
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,062
Naruto!

242
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:51,609
Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get
Bushy Brow to Grandma's place, will you?

243
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:53,406
Got it! Get him to the stretcher.

244
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:56,174
No, don't worry about me.
I'm okay. See to Yagura first.

245
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:01,050
Speaking of which,
I still haven't asked of Yagura's real name.

246
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,583
Lee, there'll be plenty of tim
for that later.

247
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,256
Administering first aid
should take priority.

248
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,618
Yes! Guy Sensei!

249
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:11,390
Yup, yup... That is really one
super teacher student relationship.

250
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:13,829
I wish mine was as good...

251
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,293
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

252
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:46,797
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

253
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:51,302
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

254
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,432
<i>Suggestively</i>

255
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:59,239

00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:17,451
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

259
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:22,626
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

260
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,220
Yo, Kiba, Neji!

261
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,026
As always, you have
no sense for tension.

262
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,862
-What was that?!
- Be quiet, you guys.

263
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:58,164
That's right. They are about to
give us important instructions.

264
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,431
- Okay...
- Choji too! Can't you eat a little later?

265
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,769
- I don't mind.
- That's not the point at all!

266
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:03,897
N -Naruto... Um... I...

267
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,442
Things are heating up in here,
aren't they, Sakura?

268
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,374
You are getting too excited.

269
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:07,377
Hey. We're all here.

270
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:09,914
Then, I'll explain the next mission.

271
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:14,818
Next time:
"Crisis: The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather!
