2
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,330
What's wrong?

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,360
You come at me and could only do that?

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,780
You couldn't even lay your finger on me.

5
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,830
You make me laugh!

6
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,240
"Explosive"

7
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,790
I don't know how far I can go, but...

8
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,270
I'll do whatever I can do!

9
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,230
Explosion!
This is the Naruto Ninpo Book!!

10
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,080
Kagebunshin no Jutsu

11
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,790
I'm coming!

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
From now, the secret Taijutsu technique,

13
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,130
Uzumaki Naruto

14
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,080
Bunshin Taiatari
(Clone directly dashing against you)

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,290
Now!

16
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,420
O.K.!

17
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,330
Kagebunshin no jutsu

18
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,380
One more!

19
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,670
Kagebunshin no jutsu

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,960
Take this, the Hidden Konoha secret Taijutsu
technique I learned from Kakashi sensei.

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,340
Senen Goroshi
(1000 years of pain)

22
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,410
It's just an enema...

23
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,680
Kaboom.

24
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,340
That was a great blow.

25
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,500
Did he do it?

26
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,150
After all that effort, you only got one blow.

27
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,710
Shut up.

28
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,020
Who think he'd attack the root of the
tail where the defense is most weak...

29
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,590
Though I didn't get any injuries, it's
impossible to absorb all the impact.

30
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,250
Did I underestimate him too much?

31
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,250
Hey, Naruto.

32
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,460
You've got to save Sakura with all you've got.

33
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,230
And after you rescue her carry
 her away from here immediately.

34
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,950
I know you can do it.

35
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,810
Sasuke, you...

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,420
Even with my current condition, I
can stop him only for a little while.

37
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,340
If I'm finished here then I was just only at this level.

38
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,580
I lost everything once before.

39
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,940
Never again...

40
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,360
I don't want to see my precious comrades die in front of me.

41
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,530
Precious comrades.

42
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,890
I won't never let my comrades die.

43
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,570
I get it...

44
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,490
That's right.

45
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,470
Because he was like me... because he's lived
feeling the sadness and loneliness like I did.

46
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,230
I thought he is strong because he's living in
such loneliness and kept fighting for himself.

47
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,270
But the real strength isn't something like that.

48
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,310
You cannot gain real strength
from fighting only for yourself.

49
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,220
Do you have somebody precious to you?

50
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,650
When a person wants to protect
something or somebody precious to him...

51
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,640
he can be truly strong.

52
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,050
You will become strong.

53
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,670
What amount of chakra is he creating!?

54
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,310
Is this Naruto?

55
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,970
I'll definitely...

56
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,130
protect them till the end!

57
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,580
Taju Kage Bunshin no Jutsu
(extra multiple shadow clone)

58
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,690
He does that well.

59
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,670
Sorry for keeping you waiting for long time!

60
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,280
This is the beginning of Uzumaki (swirl) Naruto Ninpo Books!

61
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,990
What is the number of clones?

62
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,010
What is this?

63
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,960
Wow! This is amazing!

64
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,230
You're somewhat promising.

65
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,040
You... this is...

66
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,320
Sasuke, you take a good rest.

67
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,630
Leave everything to me, Uzumaki Naruto.

68
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,820
This is...

69
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Alright, everybody! Let's go!

70
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,640
*that* Naruto?

71
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,750
Jump!

72
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,020
Naruto Ninpo cho (book)

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,740
Shiho Happo Shuriken no Maki
(Chapter - Shuriken Everywhere)

74
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,500
My body still isn't recovered. I have to defend with Sand.

75
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,170
Here it comes!

76
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,930
Uzumaki

77
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,050
Naruto Nisen Rendan
(2000 continuous attacks)

78
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,670
...chapter

79
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,820
This guy...

80
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,680
This time will be 4000 continuous attacks using both legs!

81
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,850
Here it comes!

82
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,490
What the heck is he all of the sudden?!

83
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,430
No way... against Gaara in that form...

84
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,470
From where did he get this much power?

85
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,490
I...

86
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,300
...against this...

87
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,650
It's impossible that I lose to a guy like this!

88
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,510
What is that?

89
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,570
It's finally out...

90
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,370
The final form.

91
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,300
This is the monster inside of him.

92
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,640
I never imagined that I would show this form to you guys!

93
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,250
Shit... my body...

94
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,670
Theres not much chakra left anymore because of the Bunshin I did...

95
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,950
Shit...

96
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,760
Inu Tori Saru Hitsuji
(Dog, Hen, Monkey, Sheep)

97
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,490
This is the end.

98
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,680
Sabaku Sou...

99
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,070
Kuchiyose no jutsu!

100
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm surprised he did Kuchiyose in that situation.

101
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,070
I'll protect Sakura-chan.

102
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,560
You keep me entertained till no end.

103
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,350
Naruto... you.. what on the earth...

104
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,840
Finally you see the result of my training!

105
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,400
Good.  I can do it.

106
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,390
What're you doing?

107
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,600
You again? What do you want?

108
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,410
It's Shukaku of Sand, if I remember correctly...

109
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,710
Gama Oyabin, fight with me!

110
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,100
I don't think so...

111
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,950
Why should I go to all the trouble against that guy?

112
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,880
It's so stupid.

113
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,140
Why? You told me you'll make me your subordinate!

114
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,710
Isn't Oyabun the one help out the Kobun
(subordinate) when he's in trouble?

115
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
That's the Moral code, isn't it?

116
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,920
I sure did say I'll make you my subordinate, but..

117
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,520
I still haven't exchanged Sakazuki (Sake cup) with you.

118
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,860
What? I'm not twenty years old yet! I can't drink Sake!

119
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,070
Don't say that and listen to what he says, Dad.

120
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,690
Dad?

121
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,000
Why are you here in a place like this Gamakichi?

122
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,830
I came out to play because I was bored...

123
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,770
What? What? You guys are father and son?

124
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,210
...but that guy tried to bully me.

125
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,220
What did you say?

126
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,080
Then I was saved by this guy.

127
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,500
He fought with that monster. This guy is an interesting guy.

128
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,390
I see.

129
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,330
Kid, I accept you as my subordinate.

130
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,240
Plus, I'll show you what Jingi (moral code) is about.

131
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,620
I'll make you pay for what you did.

132
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,080
You, worthless kid!

133
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,570
Hold on tight!

134
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,860
Take this!

135
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,530
Incredible!

136
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,490
What a guy. It's too heavy and I can only swing the dagger.

137
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,120
If I don't finish quickly, the landscape will change.

138
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,300
Hey, Hey, oyabin!

139
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,980
Sakura-chan is somewhere over there. So, don't go there.

140
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,370
Lure him out this way, please.

141
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,680
That's his woman, dad.

142
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,550
I can't rescue Sakura-chan without beating this guy up.

143
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,310
Interesting. Interesting, Uzumaki Naruto.

144
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,170
Damn it. Gaara's planning to do
that. I have to get out of here.

145
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,830
That is...

146
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,730
Is that the medium, eh?

147
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,560
This is my regard to you keeping me entertained until now.

148
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:05,450
I'll let you see the real power of the Sand incarnation.

149
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,690
That dark circles of his eyes...

150
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:15,960
That medium shows signs of insomnia
because of being possessed with Shukaku.

151
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,860
What? Insomnia?

152
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:28,420
A person who's possessed with Monster Tanuki (raccoon dog)
Shukaku is unable to have good sleep, not even one night.

153
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,980
Because of fear.

154
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:38,260
Once you fall asleep, Shukaku will eat
your own character little by little,

155
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,290
and eventually you'll not be yourself.

156
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:54,400
Since it's not possible to sleep well normally, a
medium tends to have his character getting more unstable.

157
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:06,690
Therefore, while the medium is awake, the
power of Shukaku is suppressed normally.

158
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,970
But,

159
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,200
when the medium goes into sleep...

160
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,630
Tanuki Neiri no Jutsu
(fake sleep no jutsu)

161
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,530
He did it.

162
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,750
What's gonna happen, Oyabin?

163
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,630
Once Tanuki Neiri no Jutsu is
started, Shukaku's gonna come out.

164
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,100
Yahoo! I'm finally be able to come out!

165
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,420
That's Shukaku?

166
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,950
He's unexpectedly funky, isn't he?

167
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,810
Suddenly, I find a guy I want to kill!

168
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,190
We're gonna jump.

169
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,320
What?

170
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,790
Fuuton Renku Dan
(Wind element Continuous Airwave Cannon)

171
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,700
Suiton Teppo Dama
(Water element Bullet)

172
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,760
This is as if it's a storm.

173
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,760
What kind of battle are they doing...

174
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,330
Oyabin, that way isn't good!

175
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,400
Be quiet. I know that.

176
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,620
Renku Dan!

177
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,580
Teppo Dama!

178
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,820
Sorry!

179
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,140
It's bad, Oyabin. There's one left!

180
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,230
Yahoo! I did it! I killed him! Killed him!

181
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,660
That hurts!

182
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,130
You throw a ball with a lot of chakra in it!

183
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,770
Even I can't take any more those.

184
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,800
Then, what should we do?

185
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,700
As a start, rough up the medium kid to wake him up.

186
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,750
Then the jutsu will end.

187
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,190
How're we gonna wake him up?

188
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,040
Just give one blow to that kid.

189
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,340
Teppo Dama!

190
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,480
You won't hit me.

191
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,480
Now.

192
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,870
Oyabin! I can't punch him if you don't hold him firmly!

193
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,540
I'm a Toad... I don't have neither
fangs nor nails to stop his movement.

194
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,290
Then! What should we do?

195
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,930
Transform into a thing that have
those with Henge-no-jutsu. (Transform)

196
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,450
But, I'm not good at Henge.

197
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,280
What?

198
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,660
So, you become my will and do the hand seal.

199
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,900
What?

200
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,830
It's a Combination Henge.

201
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,550
Yes, sir!

202
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,750
One with fangs and nails, you got it?

203
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,620
Let me see...

204
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,280
Let's go!

205
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,140
Oh no! Wait! Hold on a sec!

206
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,570
Fangs and nails... fangs and nails... fangs and nails....

207
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,530
Henge!

208
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,260
Henge no Jutsu!

209
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,310
That is...!

210
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,590
I don't know about your past.

211
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,730
Even my past doesn't matter.

212
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,360
I have something I want to protect. That's all.

213
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,430
Hey, no-eyebrows. Me and you, the
similar ones, let's finish this now.

214
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,640
I'll finish with the next one.

215
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,630
This is truly true,

216
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,690
this is the end!

217
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,920

Go over the limit!
