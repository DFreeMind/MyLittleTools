1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,594
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:06,429
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:12,531
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:28,989
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:34,427
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,123
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:40,634
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:45,162
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:51,802
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:56,842
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:02,288
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,856
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:19,670
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:55,677 --> 00:02:01,081
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?</i>

16
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:06,681
<i>Because I had a sad dream last night.</i>

17
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:13,224
<i>My eyes are red, from the tears I shed?</i>

18
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:18,493
<i>Swollen as I cried...</i>

19
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,260
Hey!

20
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,296
Neji! Naruto!

21
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:55,633
What happened to those guys?

22
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,933
It seems they were attacked
by the Shinobi in question...

23
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,501
So he appeared again?

24
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:02,538
He took... he took Sumaru away.

25
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:04,539
What? He took Sumaru?!

26
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,670
Yeah!

27
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:09,514
Anyway, helping the guys who are
down comes first!

28
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:11,340
We'll split up and carry them!

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,916
Got it...

30
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,083
Roger!

31
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,824
Mizura...

32
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:29,234
Naruto!

33
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:33,202
They were attacked by
the Shinobi in the mask!

34
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:36,136
There are no external injuries...
They're just unconscious.

35
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,810
Umm... What about the others?

36
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:49,014
Lee and Tenten are carrying them
here now.

37
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,454
I see...

38
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:52,626
Then Sumaru as well...?

39
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:54,225
Oh... Uh...

40
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,725
He was taken away by
the masked Shinobi.

41
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,024
I'm sorry...

42
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,834
He escaped into the Valley of Death...

43
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,327
We couldn't go after him.

44
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,137
The Valley of Death?!

45
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:16,044
Did he inhale the gas from
the Valley of Death?

46
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:20,246
No... I put him into a state of
suspended animation beforehand,

47
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,178
so there was no effect on his body.

48
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:26,018
I understand using Sumaru
to lure that person...

49
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,620
But to use a child from our same village...

50
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,590
Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?

51
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,995
We're comrades who have
already dirtied our hands...

52
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,033
What're you doing talking nice now?!

53
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,174
We'll make those Hidden Leaf kids
believe that

54
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:44,274
Sumaru's kidnapping was
the work of that person...

55
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:49,610
After we've taken back the star,
we can leave the clean up to them...

56
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:57,655
<i>Hidden Jutsu.</i>
<i>The Price of the Ninja Art. Kujaku</i>

57
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,791
Mizura isn't feeling well and
is taking a break from his training...

58
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,391
<i>Byakugan!</i>

59
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,241
<i>What's this...?!</i>

60
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:23,211
Mizura!

61
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:25,144
You okay?

62
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,014
You still need to rest...

63
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,781
I must not rest at a time like this...

64
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:33,955
I understand how you feel...

65
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,223
But you shouldn't push yourself too hard!

66
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,763
I'm fine... I can walk by myself...

67
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,307
Mizura! See, didn't I tell you?!

68
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,481
I'm okay by myself!

69
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,805
<i>Mother... Father!</i>

70
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,476
<i>Mother! Father!</i>

71
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,484
<i>Do not cry... Sumaru...</i>

72
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:39,554
<i>Your parents protected the star</i>
<i>and protected the village admirably.</i>

73
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:43,425
<i>Sumaru... Look up at the sky and watch.</i>

74
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:48,502
<i>There is a treasure you can see only</i>
<i>in the Village Hidden in the Stars.</i>

75
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,737
<i>If you were born as a Shinobi,</i>

76
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,534
<i>for the sake of protecting this village,</i>
<i>for the sake of protecting the star,</i>

77
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:56,832
<i>become strong!</i>

78
00:06:57,244 --> 00:07:01,146
<i>Like your father and your mother... Okay?</i>

79
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:10,783
Lord... Hoshikage...

80
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,908
Yeah, this looks good!

81
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:35,107
Naruto...

82
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:35,772
Huh?

83
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,115
At this rate, Mizura will die!

84
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:43,748
I felt a Chakra disturbance
and looked into it.

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,928
Despite him lying quietly,

86
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,763
his Chakra was being activated
to the utmost limit.

87
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,926
If that keeps up, he'll be killed
by his own Chakra.

88
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,474
That could never be...!

89
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:08,006
There's no mistake...

90
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,107
But...!

91
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,284
It's because of the star training.

92
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:17,487
The star has the power
to activate Chakra.

93
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,358
However, many Shinobi are unable
to control the amplification,

94
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:26,889
their bodies break down
and it leads to death.

95
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,301
In the middle of this training,
Mizura also...

96
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:35,239
The Third Hoshikage terminated
training utilizing the star

97
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,869
due to the large amount of casualties.

98
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,676
Then why again?

99
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:42,739
Lord Akahoshi,
the current leader of the village,

100
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,408
decided to resume the training
half a year ago.

101
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,884
Something so dangerous!

102
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,684
We'll make him stop right now!

103
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:54,756
Those born and raised in this village
do not fear the star training!

104
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,452
Why would you...?

105
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,463
If they can complete the training
by themselves

106
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,002
and make every effort possible for
the village as a Hidden Star Shinobi...

107
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:07,298
Even if the body w ere to be destroyed,
they would be satisfied.

108
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,173
That's just...

109
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:35,094
Go!

110
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,904
<i>Notice my Chakra... Natsuhi!</i>

111
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,220
<i>Hotarubi... Please protect the star,</i>
<i>protect Sumaru...</i>

112
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,320
Akahoshi's Chakra...

113
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,552
<i>Please use this until you get better...</i>
<i>I'm sure you will!</i>

114
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,920
<i>Thanks, Naruto...</i>

115
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:12,295
<i>But I won't...</i>

116
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,879
It seems his condition has stabilized...

117
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,641
Everyone seems okay for the time being.

118
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:32,985
It still doesn't sit right with me...

119
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:37,289
Mizura and Hokuto, they're all thinking
earnestly of the village.

120
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,617
Especially that Sumaru guy.

121
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,554
He thinks of the village
more than anyone.

122
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,624
What do you mean...?

123
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:51,131
If it were for the sake
of protecting the village

124
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,672
and the special comrades around me...

125
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:58,574
I would've gotten impatient,
wanting to get strong quickly as well.

126
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,881
Yeah... That's right...

127
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:03,407
Yes...

128
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:07,485
Well, this isn't the time to
be saying stuff like that.

129
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:10,619
The unforgivable one is that star thief!

130
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:15,928
But, there wouldn't be any suffering
from training if they didn't use the star.

131
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:17,959
I think so, too.

132
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:23,391
If they have the star, everyone would train
for the sake of the village.

133
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,663
But if they do train,
then their bodies get...

134
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:29,106
Geez, I don't know what to do!

135
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:34,279
Our mission is to protect the star.
Our first priority is to get back the star.

136
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,984
We shouldn't be meddling in
the matters that follow!

137
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:39,319
That's right...

138
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,249
Okay.

139
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,149
Got it!

140
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:46,185
Lee and Tenten, you guys search
around the village chief once more!

141
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,518
What? Again?

142
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:51,731
Why did the flying Shinobi escape
to the dangerous Valley of Death?

143
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,899
Even though he got the star,

144
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,764
why did he go so far as
to take Sumaru away?

145
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,035
Come to think of it... Why is that?

146
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,436
The quality of Chakra of
the one who took the star

147
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,601
and the one who took Sumaru away
were completely different.

148
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:04,335
- Huh?!
- What?!

149
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:05,309
Say what?!

150
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:08,910
That's right...
There are two masked Shinobi!

151
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,347
What does that mean?

152
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:15,482
In my opinion, there's more to
this mission than meets the eye.

153
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:35,004
As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku,
Lady Natsuhi.

154
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,347
Where is he...? Where's Sumaru?!

155
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:52,219
Before that, I'll have you return
the star to me...

156
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:54,222
I'll trade it for Sumaru!

157
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:55,689
The star first!

158
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:56,724
I refuse!

159
00:13:57,064 --> 00:13:59,897
Then I'll take it back by force
if I have to!

160
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,693
What's so funny?!

161
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:06,832
Akahoshi...
You're no competition to me.

162
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,300
Even after you left the village,

163
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:13,312
a few of us who were interested
continued training in secret!

164
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,243
You think you have completed
the star training

165
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:17,476
by training on your own?

166
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:21,480
Verify with your own eyes whether
or not I'm no competition!

167
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,323
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

168
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,917
Beast!

169
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:33,391
Such a folly... I have no choice.

170
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,500
Ninja Art: Kujaku... Beast!

171
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:42,699
Wha?!

172
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,517
To think she'd be this tough...

173
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,479
Yotaka! Shisou!

174
00:14:58,892 --> 00:14:59,381
Go!

175
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,219
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

176
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,662
What're you thinking, Akahoshi?!

177
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,559
I'll have you play along with me
a little while longer... Lady Natsuhi.

178
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:11,893
Huh? What is it?

179
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,536
A flow of massive Chakra...

180
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:15,537
Is it him?!

181
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:17,243
No mistake!

182
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,306
Oh?! Who is it?!

183
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,308
Our helper from the Leaf...

184
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:25,077
The Shinobi who seized the star
has appeared!

185
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:27,447
Lord Akahoshi is now delaying
that person...

186
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,316
Please fight with us!

187
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,581
All right! Let's hurry!

188
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:39,326
The enemy's power is mighty
and Lord Akahoshi alone cannot...

189
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,331
It's all he can do to delay the enemy.

190
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,402
Right. Leave it to us!

191
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:49,900
It seems nobody's here.

192
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,112
It seems they've gone out...

193
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,573
There's a faint presence
inside the residence.

194
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:58,717
Now's our chance. Let's infiltrate!

195
00:15:59,019 --> 00:15:59,542
Right!

196
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,016
Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!

197
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,519
What?! Lee?

198
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,655
Since when could you use Ninjutsu...?

199
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,029
Tenten! It's okay. There's nobody in here!

200
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,794
Hey, that's not Ninjutsu!

201
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,173
Kind of...

202
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,502
Suspicious, eh?

203
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:35,847
<i>Yikes!</i>

204
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,151
<i>Uh...uh, oh...</i>

205
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:49,335
Well... I guess I can do it later.

206
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:00,905
It seems to be a medical room...

207
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,473
Somebody's being laid down in a bed.

208
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,646
I wonder who it is?

209
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:08,550
That's...!

210
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:11,787
Sumaru!

211
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,327
Why did you make Sumaru and
the others do that star training?

212
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,271
You should've been told by
the Third Hoshikage

213
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,963
about how dangerous that training is!

214
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,866
You yourself... are the answer to that!

215
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:32,939
What?!

216
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,539
That Chakra is wonderful!

217
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,114
It would make for great fighting strength

218
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,245
if we had one hundred, no,
even ten Shinobi like you!

219
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:44,213
The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages
would be no match for us

220
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,315
even if they all ganged up on us!

221
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:47,225
It's still not too late.

222
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:51,325
Let's make this village into
an invincible Hidden Star Village!

223
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:58,468
<i>It hurts... It hurts...</i>

224
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,474
<i>My body feels like it is on fire!</i>

225
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:01,771
<i>Help me...</i>

226
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,106
<i>I must train... Star training...</i>

227
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:08,443
- <i>That's enough... That's enough.</i>
- <i>For the sake of Hidden Star Village...</i>

228
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:11,844
<i>There's no need to do</i>
<i>such painful training!</i>

229
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:17,079
That sorrow must not be repeated...

230
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:19,849
If you're saying you're going to
continue this any further...!

231
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:30,902
W Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!

232
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,739
You can't do it! Natsuhi!

233
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:39,876
Sumaru, who is more important
than your life, is in my hands!

234
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,451
There he is!
He's moving in on Akahoshi!

235
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,294
All right!
I won't let him get away this time.

236
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:59,124
Wait! He's not an opponent
you can take on from the front.

237
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,067
I've got a plan.

238
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:01,993
A plan...?

239
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,830
I'll stop his Chakra,
so I leave the rest to you!

240
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,771
<i>Indeed, the situation will get worse</i>
<i>if we're too slow.</i>

241
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,869
Got it! Be careful, Naruto!

242
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,011
All right! Let's go!

243
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:17,107
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

244
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,544
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

245
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,081
You again?!

246
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:37,794
<i>It's more than I imagined.</i>

247
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,805
<i>It's impossible from the front, after all.</i>

248
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,935
What?!

249
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:46,477
Where's the real body?!

250
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:48,605
Oh, no!

251
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,380
<i>I get it.</i>

252
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,877
<i>When controlling massive Chakra,</i>

253
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,855
<i>less attention is paid to the area around</i>
<i>the main body in spite of everything...</i>

254
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:58,583
<i>Good thinking, Naruto!</i>

255
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:02,923
He... He did it...

256
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:15,503
A woman...?!

257
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:22,843
<i>The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it...</i>

258
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,615
<i>I can find the star if I take the time...</i>

259
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,720
<i>But now's my only chance</i>
<i>to defeat Natsuhi!</i>

260
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,890
<i>As long as she interferes, I won't be able</i>
<i>to carry out my ambitions!</i>

261
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,658
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

262
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,091
Beast!

263
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,157
Naruto! Look out!

264
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:44,331
Shoot!

265
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:48,203
Naruto!

266
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,318
Something the matter, Mizura...?

267
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:02,978
No... It's nothing...

268
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:05,853
<i>Naruto...</i>

269
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:09,519
<i>Mother...</i>

270
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:29,981
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

271
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:36,653
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

272
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:52,261
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

273
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:59,142
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

274
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:04,240
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

275
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:11,223
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

276
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:18,129
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

277
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:24,899
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

278
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:31,672
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

279
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:38,349
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

280
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:45,384
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

281
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:54,298
Oh! Everybody, I just realized
something important!

282
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,459
What is it all of the sudden?

283
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:57,560
Sumaru was being captured
by Akahoshi!

284
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:01,095
Which means that the culprit who attacked
everyone was Akahoshi!

285
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:01,970
And?

286
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:06,240
Believe it or not!
One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.

287
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:08,280
Neji said that long time ago, remember?

288
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:10,316
Excellent, Neji.
You are a sharp one!

289
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:11,850
Can we move on?

290
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:15,216
Next time:
"Hoshikage: The Buried Truth"
