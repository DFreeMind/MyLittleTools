00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:26,245
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,516
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,722
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:40,096
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:45,471
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:49,065
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,444
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,447
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,815
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,283
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:08,157
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,898
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,230
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,101
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,367
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,909
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:27,344
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:55,875 --> 00:02:01,006
<i>The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan</i>

21
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:30,065
<i>No matter what darkness</i>
<i>might lie ahead,</i>

22
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:32,008
<i>I will rush into it headfirst!</i>

23
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,108
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

24
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:37,376
<i>I will get my hands</i>
<i>on that power!</i>

25
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,561
<i>It's getting late...</i>

26
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,186
<i>What was that?</i>

27
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,488
<i>I thought I sensed</i>
<i>someone there just now...</i>

28
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,061
<i>The lights...</i>

29
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,990
<i>It isn't even close</i>
<i>to bedtime yet...</i>

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,865
This is...!

31
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,303
Wh What <i>is</i> this...?!

32
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,545
<i>What the hell is this?!</i>

33
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,687
Uncle... Aunt...

34
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:59,324
Father... Mother...

35
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,564
Father? Mother?

36
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,701
<i>There's somebody in there!</i>

37
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:51,543
<i>Move!</i>

38
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:53,549
<i>Move!</i>

39
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,045
<i>Move!</i>

40
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,084
Father! Mother!

41
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,120
Big Brother!

42
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,920
Big Brother!
Father and Mother are...!

43
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,420
Why? For what reason?!

44
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:38,921
Who the hell would do
something like this...?!

45
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,129
Big Brother... what are?

46
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,576
What are you doing, Big Brother?!

47
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:01,214
You pathetic younger brother...

48
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,388
Mangekyo Sharingan!

49
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,470
Stop! Big Brother!

50
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,643
Don't make me see
this kind of thing!

51
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:29,273
Why...?!

52
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,013
Big Brother, why did you?!

53
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,402
Why...

54
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:06,379
Big Brother... Why did you?

55
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:13,156
In order to measure my vessel...

56
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:17,062
To measure your vessel?

57
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,193
Is that all?

58
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:28,266
Only for that reason...
you killed everybody...?

59
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,608
That is what is important.

60
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,944
What the hell is that?

61
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:42,646
You gotta be kidding!

62
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,037
<i>I'm scared...</i>

63
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:07,972
<i>I'm scared!</i>

64
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,227
Don't kill me...!

65
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,454
I don't believe it!

66
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,827
This is too unlike you, Big Brother.
I mean...

67
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:02,299
The reason I acted as the big brother
you desired was...

68
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:06,029
because I wanted to
measure your vessel.

69
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:12,241
You have the potential
to become my opponent

70
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,280
in order for me to measure
my vessel.

71
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:20,718
You hated me...

72
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:24,648
and you continued to have
the desire to surpass me.

73
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,919
That's exactly why
I will allow you to live...

74
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,687
for my own benefit.

75
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:35,894
You are someone who could be able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.

76
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,640
However, on one condition...

77
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:51,381
That you must kill
your closest friend...

78
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,810
Y You've gotta be kidding...

79
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:03,619
Just like I did...

80
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,499
<i>Regarding Shisui Uchiha</i>
<i>who committed suicide last night</i>

81
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,263
<i>by throwing himself into</i>
<i>the Nakano River...</i>

82
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:17,108
<i>The other one that did not show up</i>
<i>to the meeting is Shisui...</i>

83
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,644
<i>If I remember correctly...</i>

84
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:22,272
<i>you adored him like</i>
<i>he was your real older brother...</i>

85
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,150
That was... your doing...?

86
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,383
Big Brother, you... killed Shisui?!

87
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,117
That's right... and because of
that I obtained these eyes.

88
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,862
The main hall of Nakano Shrine...

89
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,493
Underneath the seventh tatami mat
on the far right

90
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,037
is the secret gathering place
of the Clan.

91
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:51,400
There you will find recorded
the secret of...

92
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:58,246
the raison of
the Uchiha Clan's Visual Jutsu.

93
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,884
<i>The secret of the raison... ?

94
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:05,820
If you attain these eyes,

95
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:08,689
you will become the third person
including myself

96
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,992
to utilize
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

97
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,432
If that happens...

98
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:18,836
then there will have been meaning
in my allowing you to live.

99
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:21,635
However... at present...

100
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,036
You are not worth killing.

101
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,947
My pathetic younger brother...

102
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,847
If you want to kill me,
then begrudge me!

103
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,313
Hate me!

104
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:37,052
And live in an ugly manner...

105
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:41,655
Run away... run away...
and cling to life...

106
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:46,130
And one day, when you have
the same eyes as I do...

107
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,527
come and stand before me!

108
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,281
<i>A dream...?</i>

109
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,165
Yes... that's right.

110
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,141
The only one who survived...
is that boy.

111
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,704
Didn't he have
an older brother?

112
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:39,510
Yes, but he's gone missing...

113
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:46,385
It can't be true...
That elite Uchiha Clan...

114
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,712
Hi, Sasuke! What did you
come to buy today?

115
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,655
<i>Sasuke, are you on your way to school?</i>

116
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:58,787
<i>Yeah.</i>

117
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:05,337
<i>I saw Itachi earlier,</i>
<i>but he's very admirable, isn't he?</i>

118
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,799
<i>He's already become</i>
<i>a top class Shinobi.</i>

119
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,534
<i>He graduated from the Ninja Academy</i>
<i>at the top of his class at age seven</i>

120
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,636
<i>and attained the rank</i>
<i>of Chunin at age ten, didn't he?</i>

121
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,841
<i>He was able to use Sharingan</i>
<i>when he was eight!</i>

122
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,817
<i>That's true, isn't it?</i>

123
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:26,187
<i>That boy is truly the pride</i>
<i>of the Uchiha Clan.</i>

124
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,864
<i>Welcome home...Sasuke!</i>

125
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,056
<i>Sasuke...!</i>

126
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:40,754
<i>Wait a second...</i>

127
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,794
<i>What is it?</i>

128
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,603
Mother?!

129
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,451
<i>Then why only Big Brother!</i>

130
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,993
<i>Your brother's your brother.</i>
<i>And you are you.</i>

131
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:19,435
<i>Father cares deeply</i>
<i>about both of you.</i>

132
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:11,749
<i>The main hall of Nakano Shrine...</i>

133
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,753
<i>Located underneath</i>
<i>the seventh tatami mat on the far right</i>

134
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,559
<i>is our clan's secret gathering place...</i>

135
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:30,073
I see... So that's what it is...

136
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:35,374
Ninja Academy

137
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,949
Hey, Shikamaru...

138
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,041
Wanna go to the candy shop
after school?

139
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,586
Huh... No way.

140
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,119
You can do that'cuz
your mother's nice,

141
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,648
but if my mother found out that I bought
myself a snack before going home,

142
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:51,218
I'd be in big trouble.

143
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:53,128
Did you hear the news...

144
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,258
that entire Uchiha Clan
was apparently murdered?

145
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,370
Yeah, my dad told me.

146
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,941
Apparently he's the only one
who survived...

147
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,318
<i>That's my boy.</i>

148
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:26,021
<i>With me, you're all</i>
<i>your father talks about...</i>

149
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:38,073
I wonder... what kind of things
Father was saying to Mother...

150
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:51,415
<i>If you want to kill me...</i>

151
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,685
<i>Begrudge me! Hate me!</i>

152
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,131
<i>If it's for the purpose of killing you,</i>

153
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:07,002
<i>I will rush headfirst into whatever</i>
<i>darkness which may lie ahead!</i>

154
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:11,274
<i>I will obtain that power no matter what!</i>

155
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,911
<i>From this point onwards,</i>
<i>I am an avenger!</i>

156
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,376
<i>Sasuke is now</i>
<i>in depths of darkness...</i>

157
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:24,287
<i>If you stop in a place like this...</i>

158
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>you won't be able to catch up</i>
<i>with Sasuke.</i>

159
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:50,344
<i>Neji, it's just like you said.</i>

160
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,449
<i>That guy looks like he's in</i>
<i>the depths of darkness right now...</i>

161
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:59,288
<i>He really hit me with</i>
<i>his full strength! Damn it!</i>

162
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:10,032
Don't you consider me...
your comrade any longer?!

163
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:16,664
Don't all those things we did together
in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!

164
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,073
No.

165
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,649
<i>I will get my hands on</i>
<i>that power no matter what.</i>

166
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,919
It wasn't meaningless...

167
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:35,353
To me, you became my...
closest friend.

168
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,429
We've become... friends?

169
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:41,898
Then... why?!

170
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,764
All the more reason why...

171
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:46,832
All the more reason why...

172
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:50,306
there's meaning in taking
you down.

173
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:58,112
I don't fully understand but...

174
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:02,518
I understood that you want to
fight me with your everything!

175
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,486
Sasuke...!

176
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,539
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

177
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:34,916
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

178
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:45,487
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

179
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:55,263
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

180
00:21:57,008 --> 00:22:02,002
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

181
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:11,313
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

182
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:23,026
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

183
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:33,468
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

184
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:46,222
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

185
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:54,489
Are you trying to take me
down for real?

186
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:57,297
I don't know any longer

187
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,167
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not!

188
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:04,933
Could it be that it was only I
who thought we were friends?

189
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:10,477
If that's the case,
I'm just a really lame guy...

190
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:12,483
Aren't I? Sasuke?

191
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,182
