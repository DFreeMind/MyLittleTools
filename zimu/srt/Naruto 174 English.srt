1
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:21,780
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:26,590
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:29,222
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,823
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,428
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:46,346
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:55,717
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:06,499
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:15,975
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:21,105
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,271
Look, Papa!

12
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,805
What is it, Kunihisa?

13
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:58,075
Look, it's sparkly and pretty.

14
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,820
That's right, Kunihisa.

15
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:06,551
Even though it's so pretty,
how can it have no value...

16
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,563
That's horrible, isn't it, Papa?

17
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:16,938
<i>Lmpossible!</i>
<i>Celebirty Ninja Art. Money Style Jutsu!</i>

18
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:20,173
A Are you serious, Grandma Tsunade!

19
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,705
Calm down!

20
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,175
Sorry, I'll calm down.

21
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,513
Since he is an important person,

22
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,679
I believe there is no one appropriate
for the job other than you.

23
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,892
Finally... Finally a mission
appropriate for my abilities.

24
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:43,726
Guarding an important person...
It has such a nice ring to it!

25
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,524
Listen seriously!

26
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:50,801
Gotcha.

27
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, about this mission...

28
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,673
Shizune.

29
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:57,336
Yes!

30
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,816
The details are written in
those documents.

31
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:06,281
His name's Kunihisa,
he lives in the capital.

32
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,651
He's the heir of
an old acquaintance of mine.

33
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,890
Your acquaintance, Grandma Tsunade?

34
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:14,553
Yes, his father's name is Kunijiro.

35
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,059
He made his fortune in one generation.
He's a successful jeweler.

36
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,059
<i>The heir of a jeweler...</i>

37
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,066
Hey, Papa?

38
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:30,843
Is this real, too?

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,846
Of course it's real, little Kuni.

40
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,149
So, is that and that and this
and the one over there too?!

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,254
Of course, little Kuni!

42
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,152
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

43
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,827
Suddenly my motivation is boosted!

44
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,123
I'll do it! I'll do that mission!

45
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,064
So where is this Kunihisa at,
Grandma Tsunade?!

46
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,103
Come in!

47
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,066
- Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
- Wow! What's this brat?

48
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,338
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

49
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,574
Ninja?

50
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,075
Don't add that question mark at
the end of your sentence, don't!

51
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:10,651
So it must be you!

52
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:15,721
You are the kid who's going with Kunihisa
to play be a -Ninja -for-a -day...

53
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,254
I'll leave him to you, then.

54
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:23,159
What? Be a Ninja for a day...?

55
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,567
My little Kuni really admires Ninja,

56
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:29,798
and he aggravates me by saying
nothing but Ninja everyday.

57
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,371
Grandma Tsunade!

58
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,637
Wasn't this
the guarding-important-person mission?!

59
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,938
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,778
I did say he's an important person,

61
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,817
but didn't say a word about
guarding him.

62
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:44,613
I was fooled! Grandma!

63
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:45,720
Naruto Uzumaki!

64
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,725
I order you to play be
a Ninja for a day with Kunihisa!

65
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,955
Damn... That's a dirty trick, Grandma!

66
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,596
Oh, there's one more thing.

67
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,489
I added your regular missions
as a service.

68
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:03,597
Oh, that's cruel, Grandma Tsunade!

69
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:12,879
Clean the pond, repair the bridge,
get rid of the savage pig,

70
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:14,904
and...

71
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:21,146
It turns out that babysitting is just added
to the regular D rank missions!

72
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,790
Ninja, Ninja.

73
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:30,889
Watch this, Kunihisa!

74
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,398
I'll teach you the awesomeness
of a Ninja.

75
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:41,973
Hey, aw esome Naruto! Awesome!

76
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:45,773
It's "be a Ninja for a day," isn't it?

77
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,609
So Kunihisa, you gather garbage
from over there, too.

78
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,948
Okay!

79
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,486
Oh, that's right.
Don't go into the marsh.

80
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,278
This marsh is bottomless,

81
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:57,917
so once you're caught,
you can't get out.

82
00:05:58,493 --> 00:05:59,585
Huh, what?

83
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,159
- Oh, no, Young Master is in trouble!
- Naruto!

84
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,062
What are you doing?!

85
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,536
You fool! I'll save you,
so you stay right there!

86
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,003
Fool! I'll be fine.

87
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,300
You'll be fine?

88
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,741
I can handle this kind of simple task
with my Ninjutsu.

89
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:15,768
Ninjutsu?

90
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,404
- Oh no! Young Master!
- Oh, no!

91
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,276
Alligator snapping turtle, Piranha, Toad!

92
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,845
Money Style:

93
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,286
Help Me Jutsu!

94
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,691
What?!

95
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,518
- Yay!
- Mine!

96
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,822
Wha?! Wh Wh Wha?!

97
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,095
I'm fine!

98
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:49,906
What are you guys doing?!

99
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:53,647
If you want money hurry up
and rescue me.

100
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,914
What good would increasing
the victims do?

101
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,522
Hey, Kunihisa.

102
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:09,354
Huh?

103
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,796
Who are they?

104
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,297
Oh, them...

105
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,309
Papa employs them and
they protect me if I get into trouble.

106
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,341
Really.

107
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,869
That's right, for example...

108
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:28,171
There!

109
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:36,714
See!

110
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:38,989
What do you mean "see"?!

111
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,953
Is it okay?

112
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,060
I said it's okay!

113
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,991
Really, really okay?

114
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:51,067
What are you so freaked out about?
It's okay!

115
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,699
But still, it's scary!

116
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,806
Cut the bull and come here now!

117
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,641
R-Right!

118
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,139
But just before that...

119
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,117
Ninja Art: Scapegoat Jutsu!

120
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,417
See? It's fine.
C'mere, quick!

121
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,225
If I get on it next,
I think it might break...

122
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:17,956
Let's check out a bunch more.

123
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,404
I'm not finished yet! More of you!

124
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:27,797
Go!

125
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,073
What the?!

126
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,088
Just as I thought.

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,418
I thought I was gonna die.

128
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,923
What were you doing, Kunihisa?!

129
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:53,632
What would have happened if
I'd got on the bridge like that?

130
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,026
C'mon you!

131
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,371
Okay everyone, your compensation!

132
00:08:59,007 --> 00:08:59,701
Here!

133
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,733
I'm telling you, stop that!

134
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,812
That kid...
He's got money, huh, Big Brother.

135
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,176
Yeah... And his main guard
is a single Genin.

136
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,383
Big Brother, it's decided.

137
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:16,715
Yeah.

138
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:25,827
What's next?

139
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:29,695
Get rid of the savage pig
who appears in the field ahead.

140
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,165
Okay! I'll do my best!

141
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,303
What the?!

142
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,866
A savage pig...?

143
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,974
More like a monster!

144
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,011
Crap!

145
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,577
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

146
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:44,985
That's cool!

147
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:51,551
Naruto!

148
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,290
Okay! It's my turn this time!

149
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,891
F-Fool! What are you doing?
Hurry up and escape!

150
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,060
Here I go!

151
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,104
Ninja Art: Money Clone Jutsu!

152
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,705
Money Clone?!

153
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,102
Huh?!

154
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,709
Hey, you ugly savage pig!

155
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,081
Starting now,
I, Kunihisa, will punish you!

156
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:21,485
Go!

157
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:27,523
Go! Get him! There!

158
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:36,532
What, nobody wants to eat your meat!
You dummy!

159
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,009
He ordered all of this!

160
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:48,638
What?!

161
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:51,781
I didn't want to,
but he forced me to...

162
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,012
Huh? W-Wait...

163
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,278
That's a lie. It's a misunderstanding!

164
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,623
Those are false charges!

165
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,966
Forgive me! Naruto...

166
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:10,295
I... How should I put this...?

167
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,401
Really hate guys like you!

168
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,437
Why are you getting so testy?

169
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,839
Geez, poor people just can't help
that they have short tempers...

170
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,116
This'll put you back in a good mood.

171
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,913
Take as much as you want!

172
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,113
Enough already!

173
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,122
I'm telling you to stop
doing stuff like that!

174
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,189
Why?

175
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,190
It's a big mistake to think that
anything can be resolved with money!

176
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:39,423
There are times when you have
to use your own power!

177
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:43,830
There hasn't been anything that
I couldn't do with money so far!

178
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,102
You... Are you always like this?

179
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,809
With that personality,
you can't make friends!

180
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,478
It's okay'cause
I can buy friends with money!

181
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:53,604
What...?

182
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,416
You... Buy friends? You mean...

183
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,951
If I give'em money,
everybody will be my friend!

184
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:03,185
Kunihisa...

185
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:06,983
That's why I hate country Ninjas.

186
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,127
They're cheap and stink of poverty...

187
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:12,394
Stupid!

188
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:17,528
Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!

189
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,175
Running made me hungry.

190
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,075
Take this and buy a boxed lunch!

191
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,783
There's nothing like a store
to buy lunch around here.

192
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,851
Well, snacks will be fine!

193
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,680
There's no convenient store
or candy shop...

194
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:41,022
You're useless!
This is why I hate the country!

195
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,759
Stupid Naruto.

196
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:50,296
What's that?

197
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,669
Oh, Young Master!

198
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:55,741
Oh!

199
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,477
Little fish, little fish!

200
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,946
Let's eat!

201
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:07,146
The kid must be stupid to get
caught in this cheap trick.

202
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,153
Don't you agree, Bro?

203
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,052
Yeah!

204
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,965
Huh? Naruto?!

205
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:24,232
Aw man,
you're really high maintenance.

206
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:25,765
Those two guys just now...

207
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,773
They were going to catch you!

208
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,478
They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever...

209
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:33,637
Whatever...?

210
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,143
I'm often a target,
because I have money.

211
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,745
Often a target...? You...

212
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,351
More importantly,
I want to eat more fish!

213
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:45,354
Go find a shop and buy some.

214
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:50,554
You... Still think you can do
anything with money?

215
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,660
All right, watch this!

216
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,032
Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!

217
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:03,638
How's that?!

218
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:08,315
You can just get things using
your own power without using money.

219
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:12,709
Even... without using money?

220
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:15,854
Damn!

221
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:18,591
He attacked us by surprise,
that cowardly bastard.

222
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,760
I'll give it back to him doubled!

223
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,426
Well, wait...

224
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,265
If we do it thoughtlessly,
we'll just get creamed again.

225
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,161
So what do we do?

226
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:28,800
We'll use that thing.

227
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:29,865
That thing...?

228
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,576
Look close at the movement
of the fish...

229
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,606
Aim for the instant when
they fall after jumping up.

230
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:42,915
Don't get hasty.

231
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:45,443
Now!

232
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,215
Oh!

233
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,219
That was close!

234
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,524
O One more time, Naruto!

235
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:54,089
I'll get the Kunai knife,
so one more time!

236
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:55,929
Master Kunihisa!

237
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,562
- It's deep over there!
- Please be careful!

238
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,601
I know, I know...

239
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,037
Where did it go?

240
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,402
I think it's in this area, but...

241
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,440
I won't let you get away this time!

242
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,641
You guys...

243
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:17,848
We hired these guys with
the money you threw away.

244
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,912
It means that now,
they're on our side...

245
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,850
Hey, you guys! I'll pay you double
what those guys did!

246
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,721
So be on my side...

247
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:28,855
Wh What the...?

248
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,427
Looks like you've run out of money.

249
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:38,995
How about you guys over there?
Wanna join us?

250
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:42,104
We'll pay up stacks of money.

251
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,504
Humph! These guys have been
with me for a long time.

252
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,008
That paltry sum won't...

253
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:51,079
We're not going along with
your selfish acts any longer!

254
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,846
Y You guys?!

255
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,854
No! I don't like it!

256
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:01,662
Annoying brat. I'll have to tie you up
so you won't move.

257
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,069
What are you doing, Kunihisa?!

258
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,832
Naruto, I... I...

259
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,875
It's fine already!

260
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,140
Hey you... I'll pay you double what
you get for your mission.

261
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,172
Won't you hand that brat over to us?

262
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,510
We're just going to demand
ransom money from his parents is all.

263
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:31,282
We won't kill him.
Relax and hand him over.

264
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:36,886
I It's not enough?
Here, how about this?

265
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:38,428
Naruto...

266
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,660
Kunihisa! Ride on my back!

267
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:41,960
O Okay.

268
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:48,133
S Still not enough, huh? Here!
That's all of it! Take it!

269
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,203
Like I said...

270
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:55,013
It's a big mistake to think
you can obtain anything with money!

271
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:56,613
Crap!

272
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:58,075
After them!

273
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,647
Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.

274
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,413
Okay!

275
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,786
<i>Damn! I can't move</i>
<i>with him on my back!</i>

276
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,798
I can't see the bottom, Naruto...

277
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,265
Go!

278
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,913
Okay! You go on ahead.

279
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,673
What?! Go on ahead?!

280
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,220
There he is! Let's get him!

281
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,277
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

282
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,017
Wh What are you doing?!

283
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,649
It's okay! Hurry up and jump!

284
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,219
I I can't... I'm scared, Naruto!

285
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,259
It's not scary, c'mon!

286
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,994
I can't... I'm scared...!

287
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:49,933
Damn it!

288
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:50,898
Do it!

289
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,174
Naruto!

290
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,735
Well, you're coming with me!

291
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:00,036
Hurry! Kunihisa!

292
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:00,943
B-But...

293
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:04,449
It's okay... You can definitely do this!
Believe it!

294
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,010
Prepare yourself!

295
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,918
No way!

296
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:14,418
Go Kunihisa!

297
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,156
Oh, Big Brother!

298
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,330
Huh?! Kunihisa?!

299
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,373
It hurts!

300
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,781
I'm going to clean those guys out
and then I'll be right over!

301
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,009
So wait a second!

302
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,149
D-Daruto...

303
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,326
D-Darudo!

304
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:50,225
The wall's collapsing... Escape!

305
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,460
How long are you guys gonna be
on top of me!

306
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,096
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

307
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,632
Wh Wh What's going on?!

308
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:01,532
<i>I have to go to him!</i>

309
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:06,076
<i>There are times when you have</i>
<i>to use your own power!</i>

310
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,842
<i>Use my own...power!</i>

311
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:17,352
<i>You can just get things using</i>
<i>your own power with out using money.</i>

312
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,093
<i>Even without money...</i>

313
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,428
<i>with my own power!</i>

314
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,824
<i>I can...do this!</i>

315
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:30,834
<i>Just one step short!</i>

316
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,897
Naruto!

317
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:35,871
Kunihisa!

318
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,080
No! A little bit more!

319
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,188
- We did it!
- We did it!

320
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:49,545
All right!

321
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,757
I It hurts but...
I'm scared but...

322
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,358
I...!

323
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,468
You... What a face?!

324
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:05,936
Kunihisa...

325
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,799
You did a good job!

326
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:17,607
Darudo!

327
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,645
Wha?!
Hold on, don't drip snot!

328
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,951
But Naruto!

329
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,649
Stop it!

330
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:30,925
Well... See ya!

331
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,398
Yeah! Next time you come play
at my house, Naruto!

332
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,064
Okay!

333
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:40,438
Really... You took great care of him.
Thank you!

334
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,505
Yeah, well...

335
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,038
Well then...

336
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:44,734
Yes...

337
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,954
Papa, Papa!

338
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,746
What is it, little Kuni?

339
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,488
Look, it's sparkly and pretty...

340
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:03,860
But it has no value,
it's just a marble, little Kuni.

341
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,531
That's true, Papa...

342
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,229
But...

343
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,740
As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter
whether it's valueless, right?

344
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,292
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

345
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,093
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

346
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,699
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

347
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,702
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

348
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,764
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

349
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,343
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

350
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,602
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

351
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,478
<i>The images.</i>

352
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,488
<i>It probably will not end</i>

353
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,884
<i>It probably will not end</i>

354
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:13,734
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

355
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,760
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

356
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,804
<i>Running freely</i>

357
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:23,434
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

358
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,536
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

359
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

360
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:36,120
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

361
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,391
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

362
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,896
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

363
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:54,339
All right, I'm fired up!
Our mission this time is a treasure hunt!

364
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:58,172
But your recent low mission
success rate concerns me.

365
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,213
No need to worry.
We've got a map, so it'll be a cinch!

366
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,270
I've thought about it, you see...

367
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,051
No need to think, believe it!

368
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,746
If you fail this mission...

369
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,116
It'll be okay, I tell you!

370
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,781
You'll all start over again
from the Academy!

371
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,323
What?!

372
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,122
Next time: "The Treasure Hunt is On!"
