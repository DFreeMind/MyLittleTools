19
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:54,043
It seems a lot bored.

20
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:59,366
Where are ended the blond man and arrogating?

21
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,450
The trees are training themselves in climbing.

22
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,219
And you do not have to make it?

23
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,036
Not, inasmuch as they are the best one…

24
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:08,137
… master Kakashi has said to me of proteggervi.

25
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,387
Indeed?

26
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,409
Like…!

27
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:16,880
Tazuna, you have a moment?

28
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:20,030
What happens, Giichi?

29
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,162
Beh…

30
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:24,503
I have thought a lot to us and…

31
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:28,601
… I would want to stop to work to the bridge.

32
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:31,501
Cos ì… cos ì  to the unexpected one!

33
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,426
Not also you…!

34
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:37,032
Tazuna, we know ourselves from a lot.

35
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:42,643
I would want to work, for ò  if we continue,
you know well of what is able Gatoo!

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,033
Nothing will have sense if they kill to us.

37
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:55,160
Why we do not interrupt the construction of the bridge?

38
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,912
I cannot make it.

39
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:05,156
This is our bridge.

40
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:08,313
This is the bridge that we are constructing entirety…

41
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,603
… confidando in the fact that would carry resources…

42
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:14,424
… to our poor country.

43
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,960
But that sense has if moriremo!

44
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:19,408
And already noon.

45
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,951
In order today we have worked enough.

46
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,621
Tazuna!

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,786
Giichi, from tomorrow not disturbing to you to come.

48
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:39,530
The country where a hero existed.

49
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:44,688
Maledizione!

50
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,359
That it is happening!!!

51
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:08,537
Not to make me ò  to exceed!

52
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:25,652
Where we go?

53
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:29,262
I must buy some ingredients for the supper.

54
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:31,382
- I accept whichever job -

55
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,746

Welcomes.

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,779
Not there is nearly null.

60
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,060
Pervertito!!!

61
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:11,486
… I was not…

62
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,006
It has been strange to me what
it has happened to you little ago.

63
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,373
Where it will go to end this city?

64
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,166
(Still!)

65
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,980
EHY…!

66
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,913
… you…

67
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,793
?

68
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,375
They give the something to me?

69
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,127
Prendi.

70
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:50,893
Thanks!

71
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:58,132
E' cos ì  from when Gatoo has arrived.

72
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:02,441
All the adults have lost the hope.

73
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,346
For this…

74
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,147
… we have need of that bridge.

75
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,381
It will be a hope symbol…

76
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:17,873
… that it will serve to giving it it wants to fight…

77
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:22,006
… to people of this country
that submitted hour alive.

78
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,768
If only…

79
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:30,224
If we only finished the bridge…!

80
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:34,657
The city would return as it was a time…

81
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:38,185
… and cos ì  its inhabitants.

82
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,161
Sasuke-kun…

83
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:48,805
Naruto…

84
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:10,123
Cursed! Cursed!
Sasuke knows them more and more up!

85
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,491
Maledizione, a po' to the time is resuming to me.

86
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,418
Not, not!

87
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:27,455
If task to Sasuke I lose only the concentration.

88
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,506
Hey, hey…

89
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,664
Qual' is your secret?

90
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:34,897
Eh?

91
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,838
But not to say it to Sasuke, we go!

92
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:39,725
Ok?

93
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,650
It listens, "chakra" uses the spiritual energy…

94
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,422
… perci ò  you do not have to be
of nervous of impaziente.

95
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:48,546
Rilassati, concentrates your energy…

96
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:51,481
… and it focuses all the Chakra in your feet.

97
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,902
To focus! To focus!

98
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,867
Well, it is working!

99
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,455
Ok! Hour I can make it us!

100
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,243
Hey, Naruto!

101
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,759
Which devil you want!?

102
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,363
Not to break off when I concentrate myself!!!

103
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,778
I wanted…

104
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:11,234
I wanted to ask to you…

105
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,385
Which thing?

106
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:18,308
Strange that attacks button with me.

107
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:24,929
Before… before you have asked council Sakura, not?

108
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,049
What has said to you?

109
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,905
AH?

110
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:33,733
You I do not say.

111
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:49,611
AAAH, how nice!

112
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,393
E' for a long time…

113
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:54,823
… that we did not make one beautiful tavolata!

114
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:02,756
- Still!
- Still!

115
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,529
If you must vomitare, you stop to eat!

116
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,105
Not! I must eat!

117
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,450
To cost to strain to me I must eat.

118
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,502
I must become stronger the first possible one.

119
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,986
(Not there is of need to arrive a lot.)

120
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,542
Uhm…

121
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:34,102
Why you hold one photo torn to the wall?

122
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,996
Inari-kun observed it continuously while we ate.

123
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:42,803
It seems that the ace of one person
it has been removed intentionally.

124
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,400
E' my husband.

125
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:54,670
E' the man who once it came
considered the hero of this city.

126
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,177
Inari, where you go?

127
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:10,899
Papà! I had said not to speak to you about he
to the presence of Inari!

128
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:25,541
That it is taken to Inari-kun?

129
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,004
Told to us cos' has not happened?

130
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,256
That man was the adoptive father of Inari.

131
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:39,115
But they were equally many joining,
just like father and son.

132
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:45,745
In that Inari period he was much happy one and sorridente.

133
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,425
For ò…

134
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,499
For ò…

135
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:59,849
Inari changes ò…

136
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:03,370
… from the day of the incident of its father.

137
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:10,500
From that day, because of that tragedy…

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,393
… the word "courage" stopped to exist…

139
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:18,339
… for people of this island and Inari.

140
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,909
Which incident?

141
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:22,359
What succeeded to Inari-kun?

142
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,394
Before explaining that episode to you....

143
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,394
… I must tell you of the man who was…

144
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,261
… called Hero from the inhabitants of the country.

145
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,940
A hero?

146
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,808
He was to incirca the three years ago…

147
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:38,742
… when Inari knew this man.

148
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,076
Little!

149
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,780
Little!

150
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,824
Not!

151
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:49,387
Its name is * Shooting Star.
* Falling star

152
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,220
And from today the dog is mine!

153
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,808
It is not Shooting Star!

154
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:54,878
E' mine Little!

155
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,758
Ridammelo!

156
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,029
Little are my friend and not you giving ò  never!

157
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,733
Taci!

158
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,414
Little!!!

159
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,151
This why me you do not have intentional to give.

160
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,980
This stupid dog does not interest me more.

161
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,198
It leaves you to go it!

162
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,922
Cos' you have made!?

163
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,988
You want to kill Little!?

164
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,294
E' your precious dog, not?

165
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,614
Sbrigati and goes it to save.

166
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,270
What happens to you?

167
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,020
T' it does not import if Little die?

168
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,169
(Sure that m' it imports.)

169
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:49,651
(E' my only friend.)

170
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,424
(For ò…)

171
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,516
It watches! A not sà dog that neanche to swim!

172
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:54,192
(For ò!)

173
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,319
(Me dispiace Little.)

174
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,622
(But so' not to swim.)

175
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:03,703
Hey! If it is your dog you would have to be dived!

176
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,546
You have exaggerated Akane-kun.

177
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:14,190
If it did not know to swim?

178
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,971
You help me!

179
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,572
We go ourselves some!

180
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,022
For ò…

181
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:24,880
Then you want to save Inari?

182
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,182
(I do not want to die.)

183
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,875
(Someone me aids!)

184
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,894
P… Little!

185
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,374
Little!!!

186
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,761
It is not a lot important, for ò…

187

198
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,492

And cos ì  has betrayed you also your dog!?

201
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,771
In my country, instead the dogs
many faithfuls are animals.

For ò  you you had to wait for, seen

203
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,884
Cos ì  I was scared that
I did not succeed to move to me.

204
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,546
I wanted to save it, for ò…

205
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,582
… of it I did not have the courage.

206
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,827
Obviously.

207
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:13,625
Normal E' to your age to have fear.

208
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,472
For ò  it remembers to you…

209
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,661
… small…

210
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,318
What?

211
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,937
… that a man must living without regretted.

212
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:28,081
You must protect us ò  that it considers important…

213
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,577
… with both the arms.

214
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,735
It does not import how much hard one or sad it is…

215
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,341
… even if you had to die.

216
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,469
Its name was Kaiza…

217
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:49,069
… a fisherman who arriv ò
here chasing a dream.

218
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,761
After this, Kaiza and Inari remained joined very.

219
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:58,249
Perhaps because the true father of Inari
mor ì  before being able to know it…

220
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,606
It and Kaiza were inseparable,
truly like father and son.

221
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:10,847
To not he wanted a lot us because Kaiza became
a member of our family.

222
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:16,280
Moreover this city had need of he.

223
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,734
Kaiza-saint it is a disaster!

224
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:21,189
This rain has made to yield the dam!

230
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,200
That disaster!

231
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,401
We must tie one rope to the dam
and to pull in order to close it!

232
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:35,250
Absurdity!
How we can tie one rope!?

233
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,248
Anyone morirebbe with that one current!

234
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,483
But at this rate the D Area will come destroyed!

This is too much, also for you!

239
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,906
Papà!

240
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,935
Not to worry to you…

241
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:56,858
Your papà is invincible.

242
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:01,438
Your papà loves the city where six been born.

243
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:16,311
You must protect us ò  that it considers important…

244
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:21,617
… with both the arms…

245
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:25,231
… also to cost of living!

00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,095

Courage, we pull strong!

250
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,951
Force!

251
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:47,955
From then Kaiza hero was called
from all people of the city…

252
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:53,120
… and Inari was much proud one of its father.

253
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:57,590
Little after Gatoo arriv ò  in city.

254
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,257
And one night…

255
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:20,054
… I have felt that you want protect the city
with your arms, not?

256
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:29,185

258
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:00,617
Listened!

259
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:05,162
This man was directing terroristic activities
against the Gatoo corporation!

260
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:08,324
Upsetting the order of this country!

261
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:11,561
Like punishment, he will be executed!

262
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,647
I hope that one what of the sort will not happen never more.

263
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,182
Papà!

264
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,261
Not, Inari!

265
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,227
Uccidetelo.

266
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,718
Papà…

267
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:48,063

00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,326
With yours…

271
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:12,832
… arms!

272
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:16,477
You have mentito to me, papà!

273
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:23,241
From that day, Inari changes ò.

274
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:26,784
Like he also Tsunami, and all the population.

275
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:32,235
A hero!?

276
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:35,325
Stupid. The heroes do not exist!

277
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,629
What you make Naruto?

278
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,736
Scordati to continue the training.

279
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,610
In order today you have consumed too much Chakra.

280
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,840
If it exaggerates, collasserai.

281
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,116
Glielo dimostrer ò.

282
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,618
?

283
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,249
Which thing?

284
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,825
The dimostrer ò…

285
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:15,941
… that in this world…

286
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,397
… the heroes exist!

287
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:36,478
Before Cultivate your hunger you idealize.

288
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:39,889
Motivated your anger to make them all realize.

289
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,009
Climbing the mountain

290
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,343
never coming down.

291
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,492
Break into the contents

292
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:46,950
never falling down

293
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:52,325
My knee is still shaking

00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:53,657

295
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,738
Sneaking out of the classroom

296
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:56,934
