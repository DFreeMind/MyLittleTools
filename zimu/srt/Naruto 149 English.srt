1
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:16,901
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:21,497
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:26,337
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:29,609
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,814
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:40,189
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:45,563
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:49,158
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,536
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:55,539
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:59,907
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:02,376
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,990
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,322
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:19,194
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:21,459
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,436
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:45,756
It's so quiet, isn't it?

21
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:49,260
Peace is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

22
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:53,959
Being able to...
drink sake tranquilly like this...

23
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:02,230
Please, this isn't the time
to be drinking sake!

24
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:07,107
Especially at a time when
the village is enjoying peace...

25
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,613
you should hurry up and
finish up your work!

26
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,510
Why is it that work
never seems to cease?

27
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:18,514
That's because you never bring
a single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!

28
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,422
There's disquiet among
the Kamizuru Clan?

29
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,519
That's a communiqu from
the ANBU Unit

30
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,223
stationed in the Land of the Earth,
isn't it?

31
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,162
That's a name one rarely hears.

32
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:33,362
The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers
of the Hidden Stone Village.

33
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,597
Long ago, they were so famous
as to be extolled

34
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:38,074
as equals of the Aburame Clan...

35
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,645
But they've died out and hardly anyone
remembers their name...

36
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,149
I see...

37
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:53,223
It says there's been some disquiet,
but there can't be many of them left.

38
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:55,785
It's really nothing to worry about...

39
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:04,659
<i>What's the difference?</i>
<i>Don't All Insects Look Alike?</i>

40
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:10,969
Wow... There are so many insects...

41
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:13,636
This is truly a paradise for insects...

42
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,670
We won't get stung, will we?

43
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,139
Almost none of these insects will
cause bodily harm to humans.

44
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:22,615
I do have some of the Aburame Clan's
secret recipe insect repellant...

45
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,790
but I would prefer not to use it,
if at all possible.

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,088
Because it would also repel
the Bikochu.

47
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,861
Then you shouldn't have
brought it out in the first place.

48
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,627
There's no mistake...

49
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,702
That kid in the lead...

50
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,998
he's a member of the Abarame Clan,
after all.

51
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,840
I never imagined that
we'd bump into them in a place like this.

52
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,984
Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?

53
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,553
Anyone who wants to get their hands
on a Bikochu

54
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:01,491
has to come to this place
during this particular period.

55
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:06,486
The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan
rests on the outcome of this mission...

56
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,624
We need to get our hands on
a Bikochu, no matter what!

57
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,638
This is a female bikochu.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,278
Pound its characteristics into your heads.

59
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,375
Okay!

60
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,776
Got it.

61
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:26,115
Hey, I've seen this thing before...

62
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,316
Hey, really?!

63
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:29,945
Where did you see it, Naruto?

64
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,053
That was...

65
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:38,928
When I inadvertently leave some food out,
they start coming out of nowhere.

66
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,431
A whole deluge of them...

67
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,468
So those were Bikochu...

68
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,838
If it's those things,
they should be easy to catch.

69
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,276
Hey...

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,972
Naruto...

71
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,406
Those are called... cockroaches.

72
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,147
Huh? Cockroaches?

73
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,083
You're comparing apples to oranges.

74
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,944
This thing is completely different!

75
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,947
They look exactly identical to me...

76
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,249
- They're not!
- They're not!

77
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,700
Depending on how one looks of it,
this could be an opportunity.

78
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,102
What do you mean, Suzumebachi?

79
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:21,432
It's been ten days since we came here...

80
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,708
we haven't been able to get
any leads on the Bikochu.

81
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,677
However, that kid from
the Abarame Clan might...

82
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:29,171
That makes sense!

83
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,508
You mean they might be able
to catch a Bikochu...

84
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:36,051
From their appearance,
it seems they're all Genin.

85
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,921
If they're able to catch
a Bikochu...

86
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,785
we'll just take it from them.

87
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,796
All insects look alike.

88
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,136
Insect Summoning Jutsu!

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,185
There aren't any... here...

90
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,276
This thing here
is different too, huh...

91
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:38,577
Huh?

92
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:55,032
<i>Don't be a burden to everyone...</i>

93
00:06:56,301 --> 00:07:00,135
<i>This mission</i>
<i>is something that I suggested...</i>

94
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,331
<i>so I will find it without fail!</i>

95
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:03,602
<i>Byakugan!</i>

96
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:14,414
<i>Just as I thought...</i>

97
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:17,353
<i>it's difficult to perceive things</i>
<i>as small as insects.</i>

98
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:23,552
Huh?!

99
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,070
Shino! Kiba!

100
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:35,296
Hinata... Did you notice too?

101
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,732
So... you did too?

102
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,335
I guess... they think they're hiding...

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,307
Unfortunately for them,

104
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,942
we have a whole array of specialists
in detecting enemies.

105
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:51,119
What should we do, Shino?
You're the leader of this mission.

106
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,754
If we end up in a battle,
there's the danger of involving the insects...

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,892
and injuring the Bikochu.

108
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,597
As long as they don't make a move,
we'll just watch them closely.

109
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:02,592
Got it.

110
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,796
I wonder if... Naruto noticed.

111
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,805
If he had noticed,
he would have raised a big clamor.

112
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,976
I don't want to stir things up.
So don't tell him.

113
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:13,738
Okay...

114
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,640
Hey, Shino! Shino!

115
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,441
I found it! I found it!

116
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,717
I'm telling you,
I found a Bikochu!

117
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,650
He found it already?!

118
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:29,489
That's impossible!

119
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:32,655
When we spent ten days searching
and couldn't find one...!

120
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:35,226
Awesome, Naruto...

121
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,832
Are you sure, Naruto?

122
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,328
Let me see it.

123
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:42,903
See... this is it, right?

124
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:50,280
It's exactly like the photo, right?

125
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,215
I might be an insect hunting genius.

126
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:54,342
Huh?

127
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:56,350
Does it look the same to you?

128
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:57,379
Huh?

129
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,459
That's called a goliath beetle...

130
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:06,396
Huh?! It's not the same thing

131
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,000
Bikochu aren't active at night.

132
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:18,267
Which means that...

133
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,407
Let's call it a day then.

134
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,545
Shino... Shino!

135
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:26,015
I found one!
This time there's no mistake!

136
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:28,752
It's probably a completely
different insect again.

137
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:29,785
Naruto...

138
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,027
Yeah! There's no mistake!

139
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:42,897
Over here! Over here!

140
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,027
If you don't hurry,
it'll fly off somewhere!

141
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,135
Hey, didn't you bring it with you?

142
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,307
I found one that's resting in a tree.

143
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,745
The shape of its feelers is certainly
the same as Bikochu.

144
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,514
And all the characteristics match.

145
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:05,154
They do, don't they?
There's no mistake it's this thing, right?!

146
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,515
B-But... Naruto...

147
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,927
This thing is different after all, isn't it?

148
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,460
Why is that?

149
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,597
It's not only size! How would you make
this one sniff scents?!

150
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:18,564
Like this!

151
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,831
This thing is called
a Fake Bikochu.

152
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,272
It has an extremely
violent temperament...

153
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:28,204
It gets angry if one touches its nose
and sometimes even eats humans...

154
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,802
What?

155
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,873
Huh?

156
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:51,058
Hey, Shino! Didn't you say
there weren't any dangerous insects!

157
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,466
Almost none... but not zero.

158
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,420
Kurobachi... Jibachi...

159
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:17,120
Do you <i>really</i> think they'll be able
to catch a Bikochu?

160
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,685
- That might be difficult...
- That might be difficult...

161
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,408
<i>Unless I control my Chakra</i>
<i>more perfectly</i>

162
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:43,977
<i>I won't be able to find something</i>
<i>as small as an insect!</i>

163
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,289
<i>To come all this way and</i>
<i>continue training...</i>

164
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,828
<i>That's quite admirable...</i>

165
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,433
The air pressure has changed.

166
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,099
That's a sure <i>sign</i> that
the weather will change.

167
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:41,473
Yeah, I realize that.

168
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,207
A wind charged with moisture
has started blowing...

169
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,273
This means
there's gonna be rainfall.

170
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,420
When it's such good weather?

171
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,021
But I can see clouds off in the distance...

172
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:53,817
Hinata...

173
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,326
We need to hurry.

174
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:03,834
Because it's said that the Bikochu
only lays an egg when it rains

175
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,705
and larva emerges from the egg
the following morning.

176
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,404
In other words,

177
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,706
if it rains today, it'll become
a mature larva tomorrow morning.

178
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:17,004
In view of the season,
this may well be our last chance.

179
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,875
If this chance slips by,

180
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,976
it will become impossible to search
for Sasuke using a Bikochu...

181
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:23,781
Sasuke...

182
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,463
It'll be fine.
I'll find it without fail!

183
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,051
Don't rain... Don't rain yet!

184
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,623
Damn! Where is it?!

185
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,764
Please come on out
before it rains!

186
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,695
Naruto...

187
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,128
What are we gonna do...

188
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:17,538
if those guys don't find
a Bikochu, Suzumebachi?

189
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,299
It was the Aburame Clan

190
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:23,074
who was the catalyst in
the downfall of the Kamizuru Clan...

191
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:26,778
<i>In order to avenge our clan's</i>
<i>longstanding grudge...</i>

192
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:28,341
<i>we will finish them off!</i>

193
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:38,284
Those guys...
They haven't made a move yet.

194
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,626
They must know that we're searching
for the Bikochu.

195
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:46,767
Which means that they must be waiting
for us to find one.

196
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:51,802
I see... So their plan is to steal it
from us once we've found one...

197
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,245
What cheapskates...

198
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:03,946
Rain...

199
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,260
Not this one either!

200
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,890
Damn! When I told it not to rain!

201
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,501
<i>There's no more time...</i>

202
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,500
<i>Don't be a burden to everyone...</i>

203
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,974
<i>So ultimately...</i>
<i>I contributed nothing.</i>

204
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,683
There's still plenty of time!

205
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:43,592
Naruto...

206
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:49,127
<i>I will not go back on my word...</i>
<i>That's my Way of Ninja!</i>

207
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:54,533
<i>That's right...</i>

208
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,974
<i>This mission is something</i>
<i>I suggested!</i>

209
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:02,067
<i>When Naruto hasn't given up,</i>
<i>what's up with me giving up?!</i>

210
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:03,477
Hinata!

211
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:09,878
This rain may be
very advantageous to you.

212
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,513
What do you mean?

213
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:15,454
When the surrounding temperature cools,

214
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,017
living creatures become
easier to discern.

215
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:26,733
<i>Naruto, I won't give up either!</i>

216
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:28,501
Byakugan!

217
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,814
<i>I have to...</i>
<i>I have to concentrate more...</i>

218
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:47,256
<i>I need to... I need to...</i>
<i>control my Chakra!</i>

219
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,190
<i>I can see them!</i>
<i>So those are insects!</i>

220
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,593
<i>That insect...is wrong...</i>

221
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,332
<i>This insect is wrong too.</i>

222
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,231
<i>That's...!</i>

223
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,140
<i>There it is!</i>

224
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:12,348
Naruto! On the side of that tree!
There's a Bikochu there!

225
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:37,807
I caught it!

226
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,807
We did it...!

227
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,810
I did it! I caught it!

228
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,682
There's no mistake.
It's a female Bikochu.

229
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,486
- Yes! I did it!
- Cripes...

230
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:53,649
Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!

231
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:54,850
That's so great, Naruto!

232
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:57,224
Hinata! It's thanks to you!

233
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:01,390
Naruto... is... hugging me!

234
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,227
What's the matter, Akamaru?

235
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,899
All right! It's an egg!

236
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,203
It laid an egg, huh...

237
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,906
Really?

238
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,774
It will emerge by tomorrow...

239
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:19,806
So then we should make it
recognize Sasuke's scent, right?!

240
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,447
<i>Sasuke... I'll find you without fail!</i>

241
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,897
It looks like they finally found one...

242
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,558
The time has come, hasn't it?

243
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,834
Yeah...

244
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:50,442
That Naruto... He suddenly...

245
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,715
pressed his face so close to mine...

246
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,117
So... you were able
to dodgerthat one just now.

247
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,721
That was pretty well done
for a Genin.

248
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:09,730
<i>They're the ones who've</i>
<i>been trailing us all this time...</i>

249
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:13,533
However, I wonder if you'll be able
to escape from this attack?

250
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,700
Ninja Art... Honey Jutsu!

251
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,671
Bees?!

252
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,384
No... that's!

253
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:38,687
It looks like you've noticed, huh.
That's honey.

254
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:41,554
Honey that adheres like a bonding ag ent!

255
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,039
I used up all my Chakra earlier...

256
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,605
That thing is a real bee.

257
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,746
<i>Naruto...</i>

258
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:13,889
What do you think, Akamaru?

259
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,361
I see...

260
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:20,098
I was convinced that those guys
would make some kind of move.

261
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,300
There hasn't been any sign
of them since earlier on...

262
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,436
There's a possibility that
we've overlooked something.

263
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,469
Hey, Naruto!

264
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,509
Huh?

265
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:30,544
Where's Hinata?

266
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,207
She said she was gonna
go wash her face.

267
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,346
Hmm...

268
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:38,184
But it's been quite some time.
I wonder what she's doing?

269
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:39,354
Could it be that...?!

270
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,816
Huh? What?

271
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:42,616
- Naruto!
- Wha?!

272
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:48,191
A letter on a Kunai?

273
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,327
Huh?!

274
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:53,496
<i>We are holding the Kunoichi</i>
<i>brat hostage.</i>

275
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:55,169
<i>If you want to get her back,</i>

276
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,173
<i>it'll be in exchange for</i>
<i>the Bikochu.</i>

277
00:20:57,241 --> 00:21:00,642
<i>Come to the top of</i>
<i>the eastern hill later tonight.</i>

278
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,313
Damn! So that was their move!

279
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:05,244
Hinata...!

280
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:32,838
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

281
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,311
<i>And you become speechless</i>

282
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:42,311
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

283
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,549
<i>So you don't answer</i>

284
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:51,253
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

285
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:56,130
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

286
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,634
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

287
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:07,839
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

288
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:17,446
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

289
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:26,623
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

290
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:38,436
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

291
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,823
Damn! We've run out of options!

292
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:54,880
It's too soon to give up.

293
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,154
But we don't even know
where Hinata is?!

294
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:01,128
No, there's one place Hinata
is sure to appear.

295
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,123
I get it! The place where
the exchange will take place!

296
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,065
We have one chance.

297
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,897
Awright! I'll do it!

298
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:11,235
I'll protect Hinata and
the Faint Scent Beetle without fail!

299
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:16,840
