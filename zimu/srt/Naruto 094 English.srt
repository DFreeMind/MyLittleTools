But before, I want that Tsunade makes something affinchè recovers my forces.

How?

62
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,320
It would not work against of he.

You would consume your Chakra uselessly.

We do not look at ourselves from a lot!

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,710
Jiraiya-sama, because of the poison, you cannot use yours correctly chakra.

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,900
Your stupidity is too much, is not true Jiraiya?

Apparently, it did not want.

78
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,000
Probably she has given a poison to it that limits its power.

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,750
To sacrifice Jiraiya, eh?

80
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,020
Creed that Tsunade wanted to make it, but…

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,400
Merda, has uncovered my handicap.

The Child with the Kyuubi demon of the examination of Chuunin…

86
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,800
I would have had to kill it when of it I had the opportunity.

they are the Sannin and the Third Hokage.

90
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,900
Then it has been Jiraiya-sama to remove I seal to Naruto-kun?

Even if six become Genin, and even if for case you would become Hokage, is well.

177
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,780
In I do not have fear of you. You could dirmi the same thing?

178
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,910
They are not like you. I  will receive  the title it of Hokage!

179
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,550
Why to become Hokage, is my dream!

180
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,140
A not more six child.

181
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,380
You would have to stop to fight.

182
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,520
It watches in face the truth. If you want to escape, makes it.

183
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,790
Ehi, cos' is this look?

184
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,750
You are in order to die. And if morirai your dreams svaniranno in the null one.

185
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,400
You want to perhaps die! Nawaki, six solo a Genin.

186
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,360
On the battlefield, it is well to escape.

187
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,320
I will not never escape !

188
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,490
The children believe that all it is easy.

189
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,660
This is because they allow it to say of the stupidities and having of the unattainable dreams…

190
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,140
It is  for that they never do not abandon.

191
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,650
Jiraiya, six state you to insegnargli the Rasengan?

192
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,380
Insegnargli one technical that will not be able to comprise? The just six its Master?

193
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,620
You would not have to encourage it.

194
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,380
He is  for that this child says that he dreams to become Hokage and other fesserie…

195
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
If he continues to run after this stupid dream…

196
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,660
Morirai!

197
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,770
They give 3 days and I will dominate  this  technique to me!

198
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,550
In this case we make a bet.

199
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,540
Merda!

200
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,510
I  will respect  the given word.

201
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,850
This is my Ninja creed!

202
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,950
A bet?

203
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,960
I give one week to you.

204
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,040
If it succeeds in to dominate this technique,  I will admit  that you can become Hokage.

205
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,700
And I will give  this  necklace to you.

206
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,670
If it remains here firm, the much worse one for you.

207
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,360
How?

208
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,310
Why?

209
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,310
Ehi, Old Tsunade!

210
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,780
Still?

211
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,990
As I have promised to the age of our bet,  I will earn  this necklace!

212
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,250
Kage Bunshin not Jutsu

213
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,930
Because a Kage Bunshin!

214
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,910
Hour enough! You do not have need of proteggermi, Naruto!

215
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,760
Stopped!

216
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,000
I had said to you that if continues to you with this attitude you would be died!

217
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,040
And if you die.... Your dreams will die with you!

218
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,910
Not firm! It moves to you from its road! You escape!

219
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,520
It is not preoccupied.

220
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,800
I…

221
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,220
Not  morirò  before becoming Hokage!

222
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,480
tsk.. You will not go from no part!

223
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,620
Vai!

224
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,470
The same technique that it has used before.

225
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,220
Not, this is…

226
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,100
I understand…

227
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,710
In order to concentrate the chakra in its hand, it has used a Kage Bunshin.

228
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,130
If I can compress my Chakra…

229
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,000
I can make my movement!

230
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,930
Impossible!

231
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,110
RASENGAN

232
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,130
The Believe your promised. It' s too hard to give me courage…

233
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,420
Allways, the feel it. The precious Time with you…

234
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,600
