00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,140
They are tired.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
That waste!

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,070
Because!

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,720
It was its occasion in order to become Chuunin!

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,550
It is made cos ì.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,490
Indeed… I do not understand if it has been serious or less....

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,470
Neanch' I succeed to understand it…

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,940
But its intelligence and its strategy
they have exceeded the level of Genin.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,230
If true mission with squares from four had been one…

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,360
It would have won once stopped the movements of Temari.

35
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,350
Creed that has gained the challenge, but lost the encounter.

36
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,490
E' a sin that cos ì  is svogliato…

37
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,020
However, it has not lost the head during the fight and…

38
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,190
it has not fallen in the panic.

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,460
This why it succeeds to maintain the calm
also in the more difficult situations…

40
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,420
why it knows to bottom its ability.

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,260
For a Chuunin these psychological bases
they are fundamental…

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,310
Shikamaru possesses all the qualities for being a leader.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,660
If we had to judge like squad leader…

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,330
E' much more important protect just the group…

45
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,320
that to carry a.termine the mission.

46
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,780
Just.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,870
The excuse "I have carried out the mission, but I have lost
all the my group "does not go well.

48
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,540
A.termine must know to estimate the risks of carrying
the mission and to think first of all to survive…

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,810
Otherwise one is not in a position to becoming Chuunin.

50
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,160
Under this point of view, Hyuuga and Naruto have failed.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,000
Even if as Genin is Okay.

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,880
Task that Shikamaru has rinunciato to us too much soon.

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,150
What of tasks?

54
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,230
Be '…

55
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,970
they said that it has more possibility than Naruto.

56
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,000
Because it has been withdrawn!

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,610
That Stupid!

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,900
Truly they are incazzato!

59
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,740
I go to dargli one lesson!

60
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,460
Perhaps the person who will become Chuunin will be…

61
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,030
Stupid You!

62
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,280
Taci, super idiot.

63
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,240
Because six withdrawn to you!

64
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,200
We forget ourselves about this, okay?

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,740
But what you say!!

66
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,220
You could have won!

67
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,900
Taci. We go to enjoy the next encounter to us.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,660
… E' Ridicule!

69
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,880
The Next encounter…

70
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,080
Sasuke!

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,940
Crash! The time of the dance of the leaf
and of sliding of the sand!

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,790
The next encounter is that one of the Uchiha finally!

73
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,080
Yeah, but who is this Gaara?

74
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,790
Of they are not sure…
But it will not be nothing in comparison to a Uchiha.

75
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,020
You have felt? The boy of the Uchiha will come disqualified!

76
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,390
You say seriously?

77
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah.

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,260
I have felt that it is remained hardly
hurt in training before the torneo.

79
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh cabbage!

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,770
I have taken a day free in order to see this encounter!

81
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,950
It will be better than you come!

82
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,240
This encounter will come won from the Uchiha.

83
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,330
This is  that  that creeds.
I task that the boy of the sand will gain.

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,880
Of they are sure.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Not, in the world of the combats…

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,660
what  cannot be always foretold… will happen.

87
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Hokage-sama, R-with regard to Uchiha Sasuke…

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,180
Still it has not arrived.

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,890
I have not just chosen…

90
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,420
I cannot make to attend beyond the spectators.

91
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,440
…  Others 10 minuteren.

92
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,760
We attend others 10 minuteren.

93
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,700
But this is…

94
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,280
The spectators have attended to along this encounter.

95
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,790
He would be cruel to cancel it.

96
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,250
We have already waited for a lot,
what will be never others 10 minuteren?

97
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,310
Hokage-sama…

98
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,820
Uchiha, what is that it does not go!

99
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,730
When inzierà the encounter? Force!

100
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,950
Kazekage, you have reason.

101
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,070
We will attend others 10 minuteren. It goes well?

102
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,820
It goes to say it to Genma.

103
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,770
Ok

104
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,750
The Uchiha must already have been disqualified.

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,460
I understand.

106
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,490
Others 10 minuteren, eh?

107
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Sasuke-kun…

108
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,160
Hey, that one is…

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,040
You are…

110
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,670
Cabbage, What is making that idiot!

111
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,620
Still it has not arrived!

112
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
Sasuke-kun…

113
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,410
Perfavore.

114
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,390
Welcomes both.

115
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,470
Soon, You run within.

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,980
S ì!

117
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,690
Okay, we go, Lee!

118
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,270
S ì!

119
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,990
Many encounter of the first one round are already finish to you.

120
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,420
It remains only the encounter of Uchiha Sasuke against Gaara.

121
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,900
Com' has gone the encounter between Naruto-kun and Neji?

122
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,420
E' be a lot interesting.

123
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,720
Hyuuga has lost.

124
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,430
Naruto-kun… has struck Neji?

125
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,120
Then it is cos ì.

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,850
Ce you have made it…

127
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,640
Naruto-kun.

128
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,290
Dev' to have been one exciting news for he.

129
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,040
When Uchiha comes outside!

130
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,960
Fairies to exit Uchiha!

131
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,510
Uchiha!

132
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,730
Hey, lacks little to the disqualification.

133
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,040
It is indeed in order to arrive?

134
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,640
It will arrive.

135
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,620
Of they are sure.

136
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,640
Eternal damnation, what devil is making Sasuke!

137
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,980
That it will be making the Uchiha!

138
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,530
It seems that the voices of a its accident were true.

139
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,250
If it loses for disqualification,   I will have gained the bet.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,970
Others 30 second ones…

141
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,310
Sasuke-kun… you come I pray to you…

142
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,080
Sasuke… you move to arrive!

143
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,730
You will be in the troubles if it does not arrive!

144
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,640
The time is expired. Creed is the end.

145
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,470
The last encounter…

146
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,440
The time is expired, therefore…

147
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,780
You have seen? Arrived E'.

148
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,060
I make excuses myself for the delay.

149
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,110
Your name?

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,190
Uchiha Sasuke.

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,880
Uchiha Sasuke.

152
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,770
Sasuke-kun!

153
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Ce has made it.

154
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,830
Lee-saint!

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,110
Diamine… It has caused a bag to us
of problems and it does not seem upsotten.

156
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,470
Always six in delay.

157
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,470
I had thought that you would not have come
why you had fear to fight against of me.

158
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,730
And who was what she said that would have come?

159
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,260
You have gained your first encounter?

160
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,690
Sure!

161
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,490
Cos ì  not to be excited, idiot.

162
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,030
Well, um…

163
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,220
Hard E' to say it after that we are it enters to you
in the arena with our super performance…

164
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,060
But Sasuke… has been disqualified?

165
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,650
It must have taken your ugly habit to arrive in delay.

166
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Then it has been…

167
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,410
E' Ok.

168
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,350
The encounter of Sasuke has been postponed…

169
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,970
And it is just joint in time, therefore it has not been disqualified.

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,550
They are content to know it.

171
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,410
E' better than you do not lose against that boy!

172
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
Sure.

173
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,740
Anch' I want to fight against of you.

174
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,560
Sasuke!

175
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,000
Anch' I want to fight against of you.

176
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,880
I know.

177
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,470
Sasuke-kun!

178
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,160
Also after all those that it has made,
it is always crazy for Sasuke…

179
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,020
Poor Shikamaru.

180
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,540
Now they are not considered at all.

181
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,240
Task just not to be able to us to make null…

182
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,090
I want to see anch' this I meet.

183
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,860
Sakura, your group is fichissimo.

184
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,270
How never?

185
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,730
Why, per.primo.cosa, that Naruto has struck Hyuuga Neji.

186
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,420
And Sasuke-kun is one of the Uchiha clan.

187
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,220
And it seems that all have come here in order to see the encounter of Sasuke-kun.

188
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,680
Sasuke-kun is in order to strike itself with Gaara of the Sand
against which I have not been able to make null…

189
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,180
And Naruto-kun has defeated Neji, R-he who wanted to defeat…

190
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,960
Because…

191
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,580
Why they are cos ì…

192
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,610
…  mortified?

193
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,850
Lee…

194
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,250
He is in order to begin.

195
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,840
Gaara, you stop it to laugh and you come down in field.

196
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,110
Naruto, we go on.

197
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,350
Okay.

198
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,350
We use the scales in order to go up.

199
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,080

200
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,590
Six angry anchor why I have thrown to you of under?

201
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,530
It is put badly…

202
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,190
It was from that I did not see Gaara cos ì.

203
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,820
Hey! Gaara!

204
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,090
You memories the mission…

205
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Not to speak to Gaara now…

206
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,770
It would kill to you.

207
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,320
Just.

208
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,660
Hey, We go.

209
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,490

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,220
Tornei of cos ì  low level like the examination of Chuunin…

213
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,580
…  they are optimal for the bets.

214
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,790
Some Daimyo has come just with this attempt.

215
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,950
Therefore… You can lose the encounter?

216
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,380
Di' something, child.

217
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,300
Hai cos ì  fear to say something?

218
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,590

219
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,050
Stopped! Stopped!

220
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,280
If those two had not been '…

221
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,470
Probably it would have killed we.

222
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,580
I have not never seen to kill in that way without some hesitation.

223
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,280
Sasuke will have large problems with he.

224
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,700
