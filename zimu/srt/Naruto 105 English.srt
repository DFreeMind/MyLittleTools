00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,720
These scales are too much long!

31
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,320
The "Scales are calls break-breath."

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,280
Ah? I want to see!

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,280

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,420
But how much breath has?

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,360

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,070
Of I was sure.

39
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,400
The boy has earned my confidence.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,500
Six nearly arrived. Sbrigati, Idate.

41
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,530
Episode #105
Fine of the stage!
The thunders preannounce one violent crash!

42
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,540
Ehi, you…

43
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,750
S ì?

44
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,390
I must dirti that you six earned my confidence.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,400
S ì  s ì,  I have other to which thinking.

46
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,770
Someone believes in you not!?

47
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,460
During the Chuunin examination…

48
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,200
You have said that you had fallen on the tenth question, just?

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,130
Uhm.. was a strange problem that left the choice us to resolve it or not.

50
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,930
They were 3 years ago…

51
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,750
They had given the same problem to me.

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,590
Well, I go to give the tenth problem to you.

53
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
The tenth problem…

54
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,120
Which kind of question wants to make my brother us?

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,490
The tenth problem is one competition
between the 3 members of your square.

56
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,820
Once data the problem, you must answer all and 3 to the questions…

57
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,960
And one of you will be…

58
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,810
Eliminated.

59
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,750
Who will fail will have to always remain a Genin in order.

60
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,000
I will make sure  personally that it cannot more be ripresentare to the Chuunin examination.

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
Which thing?

62
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,170
Then all the job of square is not served to nothing!

63
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,140
The rules I here establish them. And I do not admit objections.

64
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,330
If you want to be withdrawn, you can make it.

65
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,690
If gone via now you can rifare the examination between 6 months.

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,300
But if a person withdraws itself, the entire square will be disqualified

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,660
But you will have the right to rifare the examination between 6 months.

68
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,880
Then, than what you have decided?

69
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,910
A member of my square will fail…

70
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,790
I have confidence in me, I can make it us.

71
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,690
But one of they will always remain Genin in order…

72
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,630
It is  a decision that its will change
life, and that one of the square companions.

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,550
If you want to be withdrawn, makes it hour never more you or.

74
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,570
It is  all, who abandons?

75
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,140
Last call…

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,240
In this case, all here…

77
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,960
you have failed!

78
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,660
P.... Why?

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,840
Waited for…

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
We have taken the choice difficult to remain here!

81
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,060
The determination of which spoken it is the worse one than all!

82
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,470
You do not have the right to become Chuunin!

83
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,230
E' all.

84
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,270
I understand.

85
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,670
Which kind of question is capitata to you ?

86
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,610
I have forgotten.

87
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,390
In effects, me it has explained, but I have not understood much good.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,060
They are remained in knows it because I had confidence in he.

89
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,690
But it has betrayed to me.

90
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,360
It was impossible to preview the result.
Then, I have asked my brother…

91
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,930
Brother, than what it was this examination!?

92
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,990
A Ninja must see to here of the normal parameters.

93
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,350
You would have had to comprise this message during the examination.

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,440
Truly I have not understood it!

95
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,780
You have not never had need of courage in order to complete one mission?

96
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,980
Idate.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Just six convinced some?

98
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,870
Sure that not. M-Ma…

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,070
Ehi…

100
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,300
Scordati the life from Ninja.

101
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,720
If you say it, I will make  it…

102
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,160
But dimmi because I have failed to the examination!

103
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,620
You must discover it alone…
You reflect to us.

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,730
I have not never found the answer to this question.

105
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,420
Aoi has caught to you, later on true?

106
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,880
Already.

107
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,570
We are arrives to you finally!

108
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,520
Hour I can continue alone. You it remains here.

109
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,610
After all this, you still say to leave to me you in peace!?

110
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,650
I cannot more receive aid from part yours.

111
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,100
I.... must make it alone us, otherwise I would be useless!

112
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,990
Ehi.... Ehi, Idate!

113
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,770
I can make it us.
The cures of Sakura-saint have made effect.

114
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,680
Merda.

115
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,680
Not! It does not make me badly!

116
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,770
Well, I go to catch up it!

117
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,720
The island of O' uzu is from the other side of the bridge.

118
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,230
You would have sbrigarti.

119
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,230
It would seem that Idate has caught up the Tempio di Modoroki.

120
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,090
What!?

121
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,780
I have underrated this Genin di Konoha.

122
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,610
Merda! Why you have not killed them!?

123
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,660
Not there is time in order to discuss of.

124
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,940
It crosses the bridge, and to the svelta.

125
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,920
Eternal damnation, than good to null!

126
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,960
Ehi. You aid only because it is my job.

127
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,000
But if it still lacks to me respect, I kill to you.

128
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,580
Spiacente S-S..Sono..…

129
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,510
Hour that you have understood, you go!

130
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,450
S ì!

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,280
It is  here!  It is  Fukusuke!

132
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,860
It is  impressive. I did not expect see again a lot soon to you.

133
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,170
This is.... The sword of Raijin!

134
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,030
Stopped!

135
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,000
Stopped!!

136
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,020
E' useless to resist.

137
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,980
It is  the leggendaria sword used from the Nidaime…

138
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,170
The sword of Raijin. Nobody  can  resistergli

139
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,590
You would have to know it.

140
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,640
After all, six the one which has it stolen for me.

141
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,120
Merda…

142
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,270
Of the mud balls.... Like in the combats between children.

143
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
Scusami but I do not have more mine kunai.

144
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,330
Naruto!

145
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,300
But you will not be able to stop the following ball with that one.

146
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,370
Kage bunshin not jutsu

147
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,250
The Chakra in the palm of the hand concentrates…

148
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,910
We go!

149
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,070
We go!

150
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,790
Still!

151
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,700
What tries to make…

152
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,850
Ninpou: Jouro Senbon!
[ Rain of pricks ]

153
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,720
Spiace to say to you it to me, but this sword of Raijin  can  cut whichever thing.

154
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,130
And of the concentrated Chakra not ago exception.

155
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,430
Naruto!

156
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,600
This time, lascerò  not to go  to you.  I will not make  the same error.

157
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,970
You must be struck against me! Not to touch Idate!

158
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,260
You say always things of the sort?

159
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,930
An other, you proteggete, and you helped dates confidence…

160
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,590
The thing begins to annoy to me.

161
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,380
The persons weak people cannot
to survive without the aid of the others.

162
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,940
This is because they believe in the others and they are made to betray.

163
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,070
The weak people as you they must always escape.>.

164
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,880
He is not cos ì,  Idate?

165
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,430
Sai well of that I speak, because it has happened when you have stolen this sword.

166
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,410
I see.

167
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,470
The village of the Rain.

168
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,790
Aoi-sensei?

169
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,300
Aoi-sensei!

170
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,970
Idate!

171
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,970
Brother…

172
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,970
Race of imbecille!

173
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,790
It returns immediately to the village!

174
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,770
Tu.... you do not become account of what you have made!?

175
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,760
What!?

176
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,120
Six strict one, as usual,

177
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,570
But it does not import, Are content that you have come.

178
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,570
Aoi-sensei?

179
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,980
A simple Jonin  cannot  interpret  that  that is written in this coil of Kinjutsu.
[ Technical prohibited ]

180
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,510
For guilt mine, two siblings tradiranno Konoha.

181
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,700
Ibiki-saint, ve I pray some, you reveal the content to me of this coil.

182
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,400
Scordatelo.

183
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,530
You have chosen the dead women.... With Idate?

184
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,430
It is  a Ninja, perhaps not much equipping…

185
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,440
But it does not have fear to die.

186
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,770
It does not seem to me that you have reason.

187
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,250
It has the printed publication fear in face.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,470
I have forgotten the life about Ninja!  I will not be  never more a Ninja! You do not kill to me!

189
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,000
It deciphers the coil.

190
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,460
You will not want at all to see yours fratellino smaller to die under your eyes, true?

191
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,890
Fratellino? It speaks about this idiot?

192
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,400
Brother…

193
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,700
This kind of threats does not work with me.

194
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,660
Ibiki, the Village of Konoha is cos ì  important for you?

195
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,110
Even if the proteggi with your life, you will be always and only one pawn!

196
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,070
E' this the reason for which you have betrayed Konoha?

197
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,780
Painful.

198
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,230
Race of…!

199
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,840
Idate!

200
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,400
Vattene!

201
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,150
And you brother?

202
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,710
I will catch up  to you, I have an account to regulate.

203
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,730
Lascerò  not to go  to you!

204
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,510
Brother!

205
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,490
Vattene! You escape!

206
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,470
But, brother!

207
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,240
Vai!

208
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,430
If it remains here you will be only of impiccio!

209
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,510
Ve I will not allow  it!

210
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,660
Vai!

211
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,910
Enough I was been strange…

212
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,820
It has risked its life for an idiot like you.

213
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,220
Later on, only you have run, and run…

214
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,960
You could have asked aid the village.

215
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,110
But you have not made it.

216
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,000
The excuse "I thought that Ibiki was died" could not resist.

217
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,320
It is  while still alive, after all.

218
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,810
To the contrary of you, Ibiki has a great talent .

219
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,330
Sopportato the torture…

220
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,990
The content from the coil has been kept secret, and it has brought back it behind

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,700
All this for guilt of good its fratellino to null.

222
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,930
You have betrayed your village, and abandoned your brother…
And tasks only to same you.

223
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:50,790
You have not believed neanche in your brother, that it has risked its life in order to save yours.

224
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,880
You had fear of the punishment.

225
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,050
Then you have not believed in Konoha, your village born them.

226
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,440
Not creeds in nobody.

227
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,320
And nobody believes in you.

228
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,070
I have not never had a pupil Bravo like you.

229
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,680
_ in order ricompensar you, you  kill  in one fraction of second.

230
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,320
Idate-saint!

231
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,720
Sasuke! Sakura-chan!

232
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,940
It recovers the Naruto forces.

233
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,760
I of he take care.

234
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,410
Not to make a lot the advanced one.

235
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,300
M' he does not import in how many you are, nobody  can  strike to me.

236
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,920
I, Rokusho Aoi, a Jonin of the Village of the Rain that handles the sword of Raijin.

237
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,820
Truly?

238
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,950
Interesting.... the sword of Raijin against my Chidori…

239
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,700
We see qual' is better.>.!

240
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,990
Then the voices were true.

241
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,720
The survivor of the Uchiha clan is more the weak person than all.

242
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,000
Sasuke-kun!

243
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,740
Sakura-saint, scappa! It will not save nobody!

244
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
you want makes you to kill!

245
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,880
Not to say it not even!

246
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,950
I you  proteggerò, Idate-saint! I have made one promised you, not?

247
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,150
Give confidence to us!

248
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,350
therefore they remain a small hurt rabbit, and an excellent pupil.

249
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,560
You will salt together in paradise.

250
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,830
It withdraws.

251
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,870
It withdraws!

252
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,150
To withdraw that what?

253
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,300
That  that you have as soon as said!

254
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,150
The survivor of the Uchiha…

255
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,150
I!

256
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,100
He is not from underrating!

257
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,620
Tu!

258
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,480
Sasuke-kun!

259
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,020
Sasuke-kun! In feet!

260
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,360
The bottom of the ocean would have to be enough cold.

261
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,820
Stopped!

262
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,930

263
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,080

264
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,090
