1
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:21,664
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,473
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:29,105
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:31,706
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:36,312
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:46,229
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:06,382
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:15,859
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:20,989
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,845
Hmm, what?

12
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:48,954
A wanted flyer.

13
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,593
"This man who calls himself
Tokichi is a major criminal

14
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,732
who has killed a family of three..."

15
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,461
"He has a bird shaped birthmark
on his chest."

16
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:03,898
A bird shaped birthmark...?
It couldn't be...

17
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:06,066
What is it, Hinata?

18
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,036
I can't tell because
his face is covered with scars.

19
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:12,749
But he has... a bird -shaped birthmark!

20
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:18,555
He has a bounty on his head too?

21
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:22,482
What the heck is going on
with everything?

22
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:32,092
<i>Hunt or Be Hunted?!</i>
<i>Showdown at the OK Temple</i>

23
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,679
Where are you going, old man?

24
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,057
Just rest quietly.

25
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:31,994
Let go!

26
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:35,332
Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine...

27
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:40,328
What the heck can you do in that condition,
you wanted man?!

28
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:49,678
A bounty hunter who was
in the bar attacked last night...

29
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,712
What's the idea of a bounty
chasing after a bounty?

30
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:57,144
It's none of your concern!

31
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,994
Your wound again...

32
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:06,531
Stop!

33
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,593
D-Don't move!

34
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:14,265
I didn't do it...

35
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:19,041
Then, how do you explain
this wanted flyer?

36
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,974
That Gosunkugi did it...

37
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,241
He killed an innocent family
of three...

38
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:30,480
just to steal money.

39
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:33,991
What do you mean by that?

40
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:43,530
I was a swordsmith in a tiny village...

41
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:48,039
in a small country sandwiched
between two large countries.

42
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:05,218
I was poor,
but for me it was a happy life.

43
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,326
But on that festival day...

44
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:36,350
I was about to go deliver a sword
that a customer had ordered.

45
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,259
I wanted to participate in the festival
right away, so I was hurrying.

46
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,591
At that very moment...

47
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,569
For some reason,
the door was half open.

48
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:59,137
It's Tokichi...
I'm delivering the sword you ordered...

49
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,977
I told everyone everything
as it happened.

50
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:15,783
But... the people in the village
wouldn't believe me.

51
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:21,185
It's because I was the only one
who hadn't shown up at the festival.

52
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:26,587
And the particular shape of the sword
that stabbed through the family...

53
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,160
A swordsmith should be able
to make any kind of weapon...

54
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:31,892
That was the reason.

55
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,761
Stand up, Tokichi!

56
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,037
Tokichi!

57
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,909
Don't let him get away! After him!

58
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:43,846
And ever since...

59
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,684
I wandered aimlessly from town to town.

60
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,381
BOUNTY
One million ryo

61
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,690
It was something
the villagers had issued.

62
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,994
And there was one more
wanted flyer besides mine...

63
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,365
BOUNTY
Threee million yen

64
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,770
...of the man who killed the family.

65
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:20,111
I resolved to capture Gosunkugi
with my own hands.

66
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,889
I would clear my name and
return to my village...

67
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:43,169
And... to get some information about him,
if even just a little...

68
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:50,738
I became a bounty hunter despite
having a price on my own head.

69
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:08,064
So that's why we were in the way, huh?

70
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:12,429
The only way to prove my innocence
is for me to capture him myself.

71
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,532
I want to go home.

72
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,577
Will you... concede him to me?

73
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,887
We're Ninja.

74
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:32,517
We carry out missions we've received,
no matter what!

75
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,859
Even if the worst were to happen,
we can't let him get away.

76
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,521
Let's go...

77
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,682
Was that okay, Naruto?

78
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,377
That Gosunkugi jerk!

79
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:05,086
We have to capture him,
no matter what.

80
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,918
That's right.

81
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:13,991
And if that old man, Sazanami,
pushes it too far in his condition,

82
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:18,195
not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi,
he could end up getting killed instead.

83
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:38,247
Don't hold back.
I'll give you...

84
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,716
the likes of my head.

85
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:47,290
You're wounded,
so I can kill you whenever I want.

86
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,967
Before that, I'll be taking Gosunkugi.

87
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,531
Well, I guess I'll just have
those Shinobi kids do their best.

88
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,351
The Land of Stone,
Post Station Two...

89
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,851
It seems everything in this town...

90
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:17,384
politics, economics, military,
is conducted by monks.

91
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,493
It really is. Nothing but temples...

92
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,193
The temple, which could be
called the head temple,

93
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,068
is the OK Temple on that mountain.

94
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,302
Hey, Hinata. What's that bell?

95
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:33,606
That was created as
the sightseeing crown jewel

96
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:37,614
to recruit people to live in their temple...
The Golden Bell!

97
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,285
It's just like it is saying,
"Please steal me."

98
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:47,183
I know...
Gosunkugi is after that bell!

99
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

100
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:25,353
But how does that Gosunkugi guy
intend to steal that bell?

101
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:40,670
Naruto!

102
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:41,404
Huh?

103
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:56,017
You guys... are Gosunkugi's...!

104
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,363
Are these guys going to corral us?!

105
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,722
Just like the time with Sazanami...

106
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:04,162
<i>Byakugan.</i>

107
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,566
Look out! Run!

108
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,571
Old Man Sazanami?!

109
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:16,610
Leave this to me!

110
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:18,479
All right!

111
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:20,176
Eat this!

112
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,857
What're you doing here...?

113
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:35,896
I just came to settle the score.

114
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,259
But... your wound is still...

115
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,835
I won't get in your way.

116
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:44,806
I'll pursue the target on my own.
This is a competition!

117
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,738
I guess it can't be helped.
I accept!

118
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:52,314
But we can't even start
as things stand now!

119
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:55,551
There are still nails in the ground...

120
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,886
He's waiting for the best moment.

121
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,957
Gosunkugi!

122
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,324
The bell... is at the top!

123
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,557
What...?! Could it be...?!

124
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,302
<i>Oh, no...!</i>

125
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,096
The nails in the ground aren't moving.

126
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,334
The Jutsu has worn off!

127
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,110
What?!

128
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,509
Damn it! When did he...?!

129
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,243
So as the words say,
we've been "nailed down," huh?

130
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,987
They're by the bell!

131
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,485
Why that!

132
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:41,365
Wait! Don't forget the bounty hunter
from last night is also after Gosunkugi!

133
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:46,898
No problem...! We'll get there first,
no matter what!

134
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,469
Let's go!

135
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:07,817
How awful...

136
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,550
That Gosunkugi jerk...!

137
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:10,824
Unforgivable!

138
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,099
Hey! Where's Gosunkugi?!

139
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:18,725
Naruto! He'll get away if we're too slow!

140
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,498
We don't have any time to think.
Let's take care of this in one shot!

141
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,569
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

142
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,338

00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:53,798
Here I go...

150
00:15:58,843 --> 00:15:59,901
I hit you with the back of the sword...

151
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,950
Where's Gosunkugi?

152
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,686
That way!

153
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:28,763
Gosunkugi!

154
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,171
He's ours!

155
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:39,779
Old man, you're going to prove
your innocence, right?!

156
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,419
If you're a bounty hunter,
then show your pride!

Too slow!

161
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:20,989
Farewell!

162
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,158
Damn it...!

163
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:29,931
It's not over yet!

164
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:31,627
What?!

165
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,699
Prepare yourself!

166
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,364
W Wait!

167
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,240
Don't be hasty...

168
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:52,484
If I kill you, the one who can prove
my innocence will be gone!

169
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,858
We lose...

170
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:56,722
That's right...

171
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:00,856
What?!

172
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,069
Bounty Sazanami,
otherwise known as Tokichi...

173
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:08,066
I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!

174
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,070
And you, bounty Gosunkugi!

175
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,869
Your spree of evil deeds...

176
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,306
The number of charges
against you is incalculable...

177
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:20,780
A government official has ordered
you hauled in for questioning!

178
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:24,852
Old man...

179
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,218
Damn it. There's nothing we can do
if the opposition is a bureaucrat...

180
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,597
You murderer!

181
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,400
Give back the family you killed!

182
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,804
We'll kill you in the same way!

183
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:51,380
<i>Damn it...!</i>

184
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,019
Hey, hey, you guys!

185
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,424
You've got nerve to put up wanted flyers
without doing a decent investigation!

186
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:20,767
This man is the true culprit behind
the murder that occurred in this village!

187
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:29,213
This Gosunkugi has already been
apprehended and has confessed.

188
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,512
And the weapon has been seized...

189
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:35,353
Therefore this individual Tokichi
shall be acquitted!

190
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,497
You jerks!
You made me work for free!

191
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:41,889
What're you going to do about it?!

192
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,534
Why'd you do that for me?

193
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:54,204
I overheard some stupid tale
of woe, you see.

194
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:58,245
It makes no difference
to a bounty hunter...

195
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,184
But I overheard it,
and so I had no choice.

196
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:06,754
It was necessary to verify whether
or not you really are a wanted man...

197
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:08,821
You...

198
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,585
Not "you. Gatsu!

199
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,922
I'm also a bounty hunter...
I'm in the same trade as you!

200
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:20,530
Gatsu...

201
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,666
Tokichi... We're sorry.

202
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,865
Forgive us, Tokichi.

203
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,845
<i>Good for you... Old Man Sazanami.</i>

204
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,239
Let's go.

205
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:46,359
I've kind of gotten homesick and
really miss the Leaf Village...

206
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:50,197
But you know, a failed mission
means failure...

207
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:53,268
The Fifth Hokage's going
to scold you good, Naruto.

208
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,433
<i>What?!</i>

209
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,210
<i>You failed another mission?!</i>

210
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:04,746
I... don't want to go home...

211
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:41,278
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

212
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:52,856
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

213
00:21:53,598 --> 00:22:04,167
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

214
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:16,352
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

215
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:27,796
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

216
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:39,341
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

217
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,105
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

218
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:54,024
Creeping up noisily,
a round, fat guy and a skinny one!

219
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:57,921
Beneath the scorching rain,
a disastrous tranquility ensues.

220
00:22:58,029 --> 00:22:59,758
Tsunade hits the jackpot!

221
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,695
Kakashi's guess is a huge bust!

222
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:03,529
Heard it somewhere,
this unprecented event!

223
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,501
The great acts of
Monday and Pocha!

224
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,194
Then comes Naruto...

225
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:09,568
Let me join in
the training too!

226
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:13,699
Next time:
"The Appearance of Strange Visitors"
