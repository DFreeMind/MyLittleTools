1
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:20,779
<i>Connecting old words</i>
<i>that have been used up</i>

2
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:29,521
<i>I just want to convey</i>
<i>my simple thoughts</i>

3
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:34,959
<i>That day's faint wind blows away</i>

4
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,089
<i>at the castle ruins of yesterday</i>

5
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,236
<i>I'll laugh with you</i>
<i>and live for the moment</i>

6
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:52,878
<i>Still that incident</i>
<i>will continue to trouble you, right?</i>

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,772
<i>That's why it must be good bye</i>

8
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:04,757
<i>Leaving nothing behind,</i>
<i>let us share what is left</i>

9
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:11,956
<i>In time, we'll realize</i>
<i>that it was everything</i>

10
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:18,698
<i>And sadness will touch our cheeks,</i>
<i>creating a river of tears</i>

11
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:28,673
<i>Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex</i>
<i>and melting away</i>

12
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,986
<i>Sand Coffin!</i>

13
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:19,856
<i>I'll</i> do it.

14
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,598
No! Please back me up.

15
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,206
I got sand in my mouth...

16
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,647
P-Please let me go!

17
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,778
You wouldn't be able to do
anything in your current state...

18
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,947
I'll do it.

19
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,621
Please be careful!

20
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,694
That guy attacks with bones!

21
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,096
Like earlier...

22
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,298
he does things like shoot bones
and extrude bones from inside his body...

23
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,339
He controls bones freely!

24
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,601
Gaara of the Desert...

25
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:11,812
You use sand,
as the name implies, huh...?

26
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,759
<i>Gaara vs. Kimimaro</i>

27
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,669
<i>Tough defense using sand...</i>

28
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,666
<i>He...isn't a close range combat type...</i>

29
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,841
<i>Getting close would be difficult, huh.</i>

30
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,456
<i>It's coming!</i>

31
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,047
Digital Shrapnel!

32
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,005
<i>There's no waste in his movements...</i>

33
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,975
<i>Sure enough,</i>
<i>he's a considerable Taijutsu user.</i>

34
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,480
<i>Attack and defense are one...</i>

35
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,082
<i>He attacks and defends</i>
<i>with sand, huh?</i>

36
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,953
<i>However, the amount of sand</i>
<i>he can control is probably...</i>

37
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,018
<i>...about the amount of sand</i>
<i>inside the gourd.</i>

38
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:32,228
Gaara of the Desert...
A dopey nickname.

39
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,560
You can't do anything
if you don't have sand.

40
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:42,864
Going to the trouble of walking around
carrying heavy sand

41
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,000
is the very proof of that.

42
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,814
Sand Shower...

43
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,552
How trite...

44
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,755
As long as I have sand,
I can do anything.

45
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,260
You're the one who's dopey...

46
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:09,467
It's easy for me to do things
like create sand with dirt...

47
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,668
<i>I get it...</i>

48
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:16,073
<i>With his own sand he grinds things</i>
<i>like rocks and minerals in dirt</i>

49
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:17,439
<i>and makes it into sand.</i>

50
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,978
<i>So he was sending his own sand</i>
<i>beneath the ground</i>

51
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,675
<i>and adding new sand, huh...?</i>

52
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,384
<i>Gaara of the Desert...</i>

53
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:29,150
<i>His nickname isn't just for display.</i>

54
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:30,746
<i>Excellent!</i>

55
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:36,559
You did it!

56
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,596
Not yet.

57
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,262
<i>Sand Burial!</i>

58
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,717
I'm reminded of that man
when I look at that guy.

59
00:05:58,818 --> 00:05:59,443
Huh?

60
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,310
Sasuke Uchiha!

61
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,250
He had the same eyes
as that guy...

62
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:06,824
The same eyes?

63
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:11,128
<i>Wanting to verify the value</i>
<i>of one's own existence...</i>

64
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,991
<i>Such eyes...</i>

65
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,235
Sasuke!

66
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,436
Sasuke!

67
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:08,615
Sasuke.

68
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:12,652
You're here, aren't you?!
At least answer me!

69
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,601
What's gotten into you?!

70
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,914
<i>I don't hate the darkness...</i>

71
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,525
<i>The darkness is where</i>
<i>I was brought up...</i>

72
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,889
Why am I... in a place like this?

73
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,392
Did I do something wrong?

74
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,512
Is there really God...?

75
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:17,974
If there is, why confine me
in a place like this?

76
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:24,819
Who's there?

77
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,885
It doesn't matter who I am...
Get out!

78
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,001
Kimimaro, the time has come to use you...

79
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:39,298
Huh?

80
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:43,567
For our sake,
for the Kaguya Clan...

81
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,609
Fight!

82
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,676
<i>Yes... To fight.</i>

83
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:54,583
<i>That is...</i>

84
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:58,688
<i>the only thing I can do now.</i>

85
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,744
N No way...

86
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,751
That's quite some pressure...

87
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,263
I would've been flattened
just like that

88
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,462
had I not made a membrane
of bone just below the skin.

89
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:02,449
Bones... That guy's a monster, too.

90
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,752
It's a troublesome body, isn't it?

91
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,617
I underestimated you...

92
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:11,795
But, I won't be caught by
your sand anymore.

93
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:24,365
Sand Tsunami!

94
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,938
<i>Wow... It's beyond</i>
<i>the scope of</i>

95
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,135
<i>escaping from the sand</i>
<i>or not getting caught...</i>

96
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:14,217
<i>To think it would change</i>
<i>the terrain itself...</i>

97
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,067
You... You did it.

98
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,137
Not yet.

99
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,242
Giant Sand Burial!

100
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,478
<i>H He's so strong...</i>

101
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:47,151
<i>He's gotten even stronger</i>
<i>than when he fought me.</i>

102
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,590
<i>But...this time for sure...</i>

103
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,632
He's a persistent guy...

104
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:55,595
Huh?!

105
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:02,504
<i>I'm still...alive...</i>

106
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:07,211
<i>Then... There's still significance</i>
<i>for me to live.</i>

107
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,407
From now, we're going
to launch a night attack

108
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,782
on the Hidden Mist Village...

109
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:18,019
As they are disconcerted
from that incident,

110
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,651
now is the perfect time for us
to make them realize our ferocity!

111
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:31,568
Make them realize the ferocity
of the Kaguya Clan!

112
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,331
- Yeah!
- Right!

113
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:37,907
What're you doing, Kimimaro?
Get going!

114
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,275
I don't know what to do...

115
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,171
You don't need to think
deeply about it.

116
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,547
Go down to the Hidden Mist Village

117
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,848
and kill every last person
you encounter!

118
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:54,823
Just act on your instincts!

119
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?

120
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,109
No...

121
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,443
I I see... Excuse me!

122
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:23,882
Haku?

123
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,550
Oh... no. It's nothing, Zabuza.

124
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:30,825
We don't have time to be stopping.
Let's hurry!

125
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:32,761
Right!

126
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:38,965
<i>He had the same eyes as I...</i>

127
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,663
<i>Before I met Zabuza...</i>

128
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,717
Hold it!

129
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:06,391
You're a hasty one, aren't you?
I'm not from this village.

130
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:17,230
The thing you are after is right there...

131
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,340
Now, go.

132
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,513
<i>It seems to have begun...</i>

133
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,847
<i>The Kaguya Clan...</i>

134
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:35,917
<i>Fools who can only find</i>
<i>their own path of life by fighting...</i>

135
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,994
<i>It was long ago</i>

136
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,760
<i>when a simple minded group that</i>
<i>just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.</i>

137
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,327
<i>With a governed organization</i>
<i>as an opponent,</i>

138
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,462
<i>they just become fools</i>
<i>rushing towards death</i>

139
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:49,564
<i>if they fight only with power...</i>

140
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:55,672
Are we the only survivors...?

141
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,077
It seems we're surrounded...

142
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,719
The defense was tighter
than we thought.

143
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,686
We have no choice...

144
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:04,688
Now it's come to this,

145
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,225
take along with you
every person you can!

146
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:11,954
We'll have them entertain us
as much as possible!

147
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,194
<i>What do I fight for... ?

148
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,360
<i>What am I...?</i>

149
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:21,097
<i>Without knowing anything,</i>
<i>I just kept on fighting.</i>

150
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,009
The time has come to use you...

151
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:27,879
<i>I'm needed...</i>

152
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,242
<i>That was the only thing</i>
<i>that got my body moving.</i>

153
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:32,780
<i>And...</i>

154
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:36,878
<i>I was also able to figure out that...</i>

155
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,423
<i>I couldn't live if I didn't fight.</i>

156
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,197
<i>Dawn broke...</i>

157
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,567
<i>And I learned that...</i>

158
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,442
<i>I myself was the only one</i>
<i>to survive.</i>

159
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:05,273
<i>Again, I'm all alone...</i>

160
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,649
<i>By myself, I just wandered</i>
<i>aimlessly from place to place.</i>

161
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,659
<i>This is...</i>

162
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,451
<i>The flower, from back then... ?

163
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:53,228
Why are you blooming
in a place like this?

164
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,634
Why won't you answer?

165
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,101
You're ignoring me, too, huh?!

166
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:08,102
There's no way you'd be seen
by someone in a place like this, yet you...!

167
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,608
That's enough...

168
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:16,750
Maybe... there's no significance to living.

169
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,448
But you might be able to
discover something interesting

170
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:24,360
by continuing to live... right?

171
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:29,456
Like how you discovered that flower...

172
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,463
Like how I discovered you.

173
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:41,074
Okay, Let's go...

174
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,488
<i>Back then...</i>
<i>Lord Orochimaru said that, but...</i>

175
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,385
<i>People are born with</i>
<i>some kind of significance.</i>

176
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:03,360
<i>That's what I think...</i>
<i>some kind of important mission.</i>

177
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,333
<i>The mission for me...</i>

178
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,167
<i>is to protect Lord Orochimaru</i>
<i>and his ambition.</i>

179
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:20,976
What's... that?!

180
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,563
Come back, Sasuke!
Everyone's worried about you!

181
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,973
Damn it...
It's so dark I can't see anything!

182
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,974
<i>You've got better eyes than me.</i>

183
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,681
<i>Sasuke is in the darkness now...</i>

184
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,417
N -Neji?!

185
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,887
<i>You'll be unable to catch up</i>
<i>with Sasuke</i>

186
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,923
<i>if you stop in a place like this...</i>

187
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,223
Neji

188
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:08,192
Yeah... You're right!
This isn't the time to stop.

189
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:14,094
Just wait! I'll take Sasuke
back home no matter what!

190
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,940
Sasuke!

191
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:47,696
<i>Sand Coffin!</i>

192
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,153
<i>That form...?!</i>

193
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,176
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

194
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,271
<i>And you smiled</i>

195
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,813
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

196
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:35,614
<i>In my own words</i>

197
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:41,250
<i>Would you think it was</i>
<i>a bother if I approached you?</i>

198
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:46,793
<i>Despite my doubts,</i>
<i>I worked up my courage</i>

199
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:52,469
<i>My clumsy attempts with words</i>

200
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:58,200
<i>You listened without turning away</i>

201
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:04,378
<i>No wonder I get carried away by you</i>

202
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:11,450
<i>But you don't feel anything for me, do you?</i>

203
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,653
<i>I feel so sad</i>

204
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:15,624
<i>But...</i>

205
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:18,094
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

206
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:21,132
<i>And you smiled</i>

207
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

208
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:26,927
<i>In my own words</i>

209
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:29,437
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

210
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:32,636
<i>And you smiled</i>

211
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,179
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

212
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:38,148
<i>In my own words</i>

213
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:42,777
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

214
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,628
I'm saved. That's excellent.

215
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:55,222
To think you could do such a thing!

216
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,559
He was persistent,
but this is the end...

217
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,139
He'll never come out again.

218
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,401
Brainwashed by Orochimaru...

219
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:07,935
It's not brainwashing!
That person understands me!

220
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,272
What do you guys know?!

221
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:15,350
