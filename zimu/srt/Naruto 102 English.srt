Been born and grown to Konoha, in the Country of the Fire,

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,980
I adore to eat of the Ramen from Ichiraku and my name is Uzumaki Naruto!

186
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,440
And the persons call to me…

187
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,650
The Ninja maldestro…

188
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,070
The Ninja maldestro. Eh!? it is not veroo!

189
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,620
I know to YOU well.

190
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,000
Jirochou head has the happy air, like always.

191
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,290
Ehi Naruto!

192
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,750
It leaves to be. A boy must be full of energy.

193
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,590
Now that there are introduces to you, we speak seriously.

194
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,390
Godaime Hokage has said that you will reveal us the details of our mission.

195
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
First of all,

196
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,230
You have felt to speak about the Race of Todori?

197
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,320
To.... To-I give.... Of that what?

198
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,780
You put yourselves comfortable.

199
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
The origin of this history…

200
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,500
laughed them to time it makes, and it begins with one legend.>.

201
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:28,750
A man, General Todori, made a rituale in order to guard the storms under its control.

202
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,430
He was decided to organize an event where its rituali were kept, every four years.

203
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,220
In principle, podistica contest was only one,

204
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,180
And all it was carried out pacifically.

205
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,610
But recently, the race has taken one different direction.

206
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,320
In the way of Tekarou, from the old times,

207
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,490
There were two groups, the Wasabi clan and the Wagarashi clan.

208
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,080
Unfortunately, these two clan never have not been in peace,

209
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,750
and they began to strike itself along the distance

210
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,430
Not only they, but also the countrymen were imply to you, and there were many wounded.

211
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,180
For being sure that all good went,

212
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,890
The getlteman have caught up an agreement.

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,940
Beginning from hour, we will not fight more, but we will make one challenge.

214
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,070
Therefore that this challenge is…

215
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,530
It is  the event that has every place four years: The Race of Todori.

216
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,080
Four years ago, the Wagarashi clan has cheated,

217
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,840
I have felt that they want to rifare it also this year.

218
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,590
This is the reason for which we have decided to call to you, and I have sent of the messengers to Konoha.

219
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,300
They have been attacks to you on the road.

220
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,400
Ve I pray some.

221
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,570
You help us.

222
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,410
We cannot lose the race against the Wagarashi clan.

223
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,410
Left that me of it I occupy!

224
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,950
And who we would have to escort?

225
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,830
Oh, accepted the mission?

226
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,130
You have called to me, Head?

227
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,510
Which thing, you know?

228
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,390
That  will facilitate the presentations.

229
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,600
It is not exactly that one.

230
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,240
Sai, Jirochou head is intelligent.

231
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,990
In truth, never it would not have been inchinato in front of you.

232
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,370
Even if it has been inchinato in front of me,

233
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,160
I do not have wants to escort a bastard like you.

234
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,870
Not even I!

235
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,500
I do not know that six kind fantino, but I would not head at your horse.

236
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,590
Which fantino!?

237
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,880

246
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,320

You would not have had to call this Ninja di Konoha.

283
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,860
Not being contrariato, Idate.

284
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,870
They are not contrariato.

285
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,870
They are objective…

286
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,170
Idate, creed in you more than in anyone other.

287
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
The rest depends on you.

288
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,550
And if I had confidence in they?

289
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,230

Even if the life will cost me.

294
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,710
I did not think that a lot important was a event!

295
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,790
But that race kind is?

296
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,050
Since you do not know it, I will explain  to you  as the race will be carried out.

297
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,260
The departure point is the Tegarashi port.

298
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,890
Once that the race has left we direct to Modoroki.

299
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,310
It is  Modoroki?

300
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,810
Exact.

301
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,440
We will use one boat in order to go to Modoroki. E' the faster means.

302
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,400
Beginning from here, the road  can  vary,

303
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,320
And it will be run until the end.

304
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,620
Here the rules.

305
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,200
Low Scorciatoie, blows, sabotaggi.. are all means allowed.

306
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,170
Then, to call of the Ninja does not go against the rules.

307
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,590
I ask myself as they are the Ninja employs to you from the adversaries.

308
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,380
They must hide and they must make attention.

309
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,670
Not to lower your guard, Naruto.

310
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,010
S ì!

311
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,600
