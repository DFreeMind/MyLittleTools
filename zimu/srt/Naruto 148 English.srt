1
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,944
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:21,541
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,381
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:29,652
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,858
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:40,232
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,607
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:49,201
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:52,580
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,583
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:59,951
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:02,420
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:08,293
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,034
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:14,366
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:19,238
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:21,503
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,045
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:27,480
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:00,139
Huh, it's Lady Tsunade.

21
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,475
Huh? You guys are...

22
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,949
Hey, are you visiting someone
at the hospital too?

23
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:07,149
Yes.

24
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:09,350
You too, Lady Tsunade?

25
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,781
Well, I guess...

26
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:13,428
She just doesn't want to stay
in the executive office...

27
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:14,392
Shut up!

28
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:18,731
Hinata, don't faint when
you see Kurenai Sensei.

29
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:21,970
P-Please let's not talk about that.

30
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:23,466
Did something happen?

31
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,700
When we were visiting Naruto
in the hospital in the past...

32
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:26,672
Shino!

33
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:30,306
This girl fainted when she saw Naruto
all covered with bandages.

34
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,277
Kiba!

35
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,911
I'II... I'll be fine this time!

36
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,340
I finally found you...!

37
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:40,152
Old Lady Tsunade, I need
to talk to you!

38
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,524
Huh? Hinata!

39
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,119
<i>Naruto...</i>

40
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:52,167
- <i>Naruto is...so close!</i>
- Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong?

41
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,037
Your face looks a little red...

42
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:58,139
Do you have a fever or something? Huh?

43
00:02:59,408 --> 00:02:59,999
Hey...

44
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,941
H-Hey, Hinata?!

45
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,517
Hey Hinata!

46
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:14,213
Are you okay?!
Get a hold of yourself!

47
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,084
Hinata!

48
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,151
Naruto...

49
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:22,858
<i>The Search for</i>
<i>the Rare Bikochu Beetle</i>

50
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:34,139
Hey, you woke up.

51
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:36,410
So Mizuki didn't know anything,
you said?

52
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:39,313
Tsunade interrogated him herself.

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,015
He didn't have any information

54
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,553
that would lead to Orochimaru's
current whereabouts...

55
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:51,321
After all, that guy was nothing but
a disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh.

56
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:53,388
So it seems...

57
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:56,021
We still don't know where
Sasuke went...

58
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:59,864
And that's the result after
a desperate fight with Mizuki...

59
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,029
That can't sit right with
Naruto either... huh?

60
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:07,904
Please Old Lady Tsunade,
say it's okay!

61
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,239
When I say no, I mean no!

62
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:13,310
As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn't able
to concentrate on her work!

63
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,110
Naruto's been breathing down
her neck the whole time

64
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,413
asking her to let him go off
in search of Sasuke.

65
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:23,421
So she sneaked out
of her office, but...

66
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,783
He was lying in wait for her here.

67
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,120
<i>Naruto...</i>

68
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,894
I've asked you numerous times already!

69
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,366
Please let me go in search
of Sasuke!

70
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:36,862
I've told you numerous times already.
Impossible!

71
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,463
Why!

72
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,599
You have some training to do!

73
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,243
I can't because Pervy Sage
isn't around!

74
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:48,208
We have zero leads on either
Orochimaru and Sasuke.

75
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:49,676
So how are you planning
to search for him?

76
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:51,945
I can figure it out somehow!

77
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,586
If there aren't any leads,
I'll go find some!

78
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:56,784
So please let me go do it!

79
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,654
You're stubborn, aren't you?

80
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,456
You're stubborn too,
Old Lady Tsunade!

81
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:02,324
- Please let me go!
- No, you may not!

82
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,831
If I say I'm going, I'm going!

83
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,696
Shut up! No means no!

84
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,162
Byakugan!

85
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,174
All right! Good work, Neji!

86
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,608
Move in another half step
right there!

87
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:22,376
Yes sir!

88
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,428
Sorry to keep you waiting.

89
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,763
Let's take a break, Neji.

90
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,132
Yes.

91
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,142
Have some tea too.

92
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:53,713
Thank you...

93
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,112
If Hinata was here,
she should have observed a little.

94
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:03,383
<i>Hinata prepared this...?</i>

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,323
It would supplement her training
by observing...

96
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:25,945
<i>Byakugan!</i>

97
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,454
Let's take a break.

98
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:43,588
Yes.

99
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,689
Food! Food!

100
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,366
That was pretty well done.

101
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,802
I would say that you're getting closer
to perfecting the technique.

102
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,767
It's thanks to you both.

103
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,977
You're so kind to join me
in my special training every day...

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,708
We're a team.

105
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,776
When a comrade in the team
is in a fix,

106
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,112
one offers a helping hand.

107
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:04,917
That's only natural...

108
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:07,722
A comrade...

109
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:13,161
If a comrade suddenly disappears,

110
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,887
it must be awfully hard.

111
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:18,898
You're talking about Naruto,
aren't you?

112
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:25,000
Isn't there some way
we could help him?

113
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,407
I'd like to help him out in
some way too... but...

114
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,174
Lady Hokage was telling Naruto...

115
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,277
that there are no leads at all.

116
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,447
There may be one resource...

117
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:43,719
Really?!

118
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,459
I'm talking about Bikochu.

119
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,122
Bikochu?

120
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,558
Are you talking about
those rare insects?!

121
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,234
I have heard that they had
become extinct some time ago.

122
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,839
Since there was a possibility
that they could become extinct,

123
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,933
the Aburame Clan discontinued
using them,

124
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:05,705
so a miniscule number of them
should still be alive.

125
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:09,273
Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?

126
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,478
Well... it's not surprising that
you don't know about them.

127
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,256
The last time that Bikochu
were used

128
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,690
was before the last Great War...

129
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:22,386
Bikochu are one kind of insect
used by insect handlers.

130
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,699
Larvae which have hatched from eggs
become chrysalises in no time at all,

131
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,759
then emerge and turn
into imagos.

132
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:31,206
They are then made to
recognize scents...

133
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:34,140
and they are able to track
even the faintest scent...

134
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,609
to its source.

135
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,710
Their olfactory sense is several thousand
times greater than a Ninja Hound's.

136
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,085
They are insects capable of
exhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.

137
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:50,516
However, Bikochu lay eggs
only once every several years...

138
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,961
This year is actually the year
in which they lay eggs.

139
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,764
And right now is exactly
the time when they hatch.

140
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,233
I see.

141
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,362
There are still some of
Sasuke's belongings left in the village...

142
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,460
Right?

143
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,169
If one makes the Bikochu,
recognize that scent...

144
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:09,208
We may be able to locate
Sasuke's whereabouts, right?

145
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,607
What is the probability
of finding a Bikochu?

146
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:18,819
Frankly speaking, not very high.
Perhaps 10%.

147
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,348
10% huh...

148
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,891
As you guys know,

149
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,868
the situation in the village
is currently very grave...

150
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:38,638
We don't have the leeway of allowing
even Genin to sit around and play.

151
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:43,842
However, fortunately or unfortunately,
Kurenai has been hospitalized,

152
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:47,470
so you guys, Squad Eight,
no longer have a mission.

153
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:50,615
Rather than just letting
you sit around and play,

154
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:53,985
I'd rather place my bet
on that 10% possibility.

155
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,319
Huh... you mean...

156
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,626
Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka.
Hinata Hyuga.

157
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,462
I order you to search for
the Bikochu!

158
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,657
- All right!
- All right!

159
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,202
I designate Shino
as the leader this time.

160
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:11,501
And... that spy up there!

161
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,470
Oww...!

162
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:20,874
Naruto...

163
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:22,549
You're going to go even if
I try to stop you, right?

164
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:23,710
Yup!

165
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,911
In that case, I have no choice
but to let you go...

166
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:28,514
However...

167
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,315
This is your last chance.

168
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:34,023
If you don't find the Bikochu...

169
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,393
you must give up on Sasuke!

170
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:37,457
Wha?

171
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:38,362
You understand?!

172
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:42,035
It'll be fine...
I'll find it without fail.

173
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,937
All right. You won't go back
on your word, right?

174
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,601
Yeah! Leave it to me!

175
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:50,309
You're easily pleased, aren't you?

176
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:52,145
Owww!

177
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,248
<i>Naruto...</i>

178
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,829
Sasuke...

179
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:18,632
Hinata.

180
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,136
Good morning.

181
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,246
Neji will be here soon
for his training...

182
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,305
Please prepare tea as always.

183
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:28,541
Well...

184
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,179
Huh? What's the matter?

185
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,844
I need to go...
on a mission starting now...

186
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,244
A mission, huh...

187
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:35,987
In that case, it can't be helped...

188
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm heading out...

189
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:42,554
Don't be a burden to the others.

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,762
Yes, sir!

191
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,941
I'm... I'm sorry! I'm in a hurry...

192
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,852
The way she handled
her physical response just now...

193
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:08,047
<i>Hinata...</i>

194
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:12,985
You're late, Hinata!

195
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:14,427
I'm sorry!

196
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:19,460
All right then! Let's head out!

197
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:21,399
Let's go!

198
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:24,431
Huh?

199
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,607
Why are you walking at
such a leisurely pace?!

200
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:29,934
It takes a Shinobi two days on foot

201
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,911
to get to the habitat of
the Bikochu...

202
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,041
There's no need to make haste
from the very start.

203
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:42,381
But what if the eggs hatch
before we get there?

204
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:46,517
The eggs of Bikochu only hatch
on the day after it's rained...

205
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,691
There's no sign of it
raining any time soon...

206
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,695
But... if by some remote chance...

207
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:51,460
Naruto.

208
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,625
Wh What is it?

209
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,930
I am the leader of this team.

210
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,266
While we are on this mission,
you will obey the orders of your leader.

211
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:08,916
Kiba, I can't believe you're able
to work with that kind of guy...

212
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,811
Well, I've gotten used to it...

213
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,547
I'm sure you'll bond with him too, Naruto.

214
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:17,822
I wonder about that...

215
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,098
Naruto and the others
left a while ago.

216
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,632
I see.

217
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,339
Didn't you want to go too?

218
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,737
<i>When it comes to searching</i>
<i>for insects,</i>

219
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,745
<i>Shino, who's an insect handler,</i>
<i>is number one...</i>

220
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,974
<i>And then Hinata who has Byakugan...</i>

221
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,108
<i>and Kiba and Akamaru who have</i>
<i>sensitive noses are there too...</i>

222
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,277
<i>So there's really no role that</i>
<i>I could play!</i>

223
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:48,316
<i>What I must do right now...</i>

224
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,621
<i>is to become a Medical Ninja</i>
<i>as soon as I possibly can!</i>

225
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:02,534
What's the matter, Shino?!

226
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,402
The sun's going down.
We're setting up camp.

227
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:06,198
Got it.

228
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:07,138
- Huh?
- Okay.

229
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:08,966
Huh? What?!

230
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,941
We're gonna set up
camp already?!

231
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:15,513
I'm not tired at all yet!
Let's go further!

232
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:20,146
Naruto, the leader of
this team is <i>me.</i>

233
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,490
I I understand!

234
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:26,926
Okay then... let's sleep.

235
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,860
Huh... we're gonna sleep already?!

236
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,362
Many animals and plants
go to sleep at sunset

237
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:34,834
and awake at sunrise.

238
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:36,968
In order to search for insects,

239
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:40,530
we must understand the rhythm
of living creatures with our own bodies...

240
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:43,305
But... the sun's just set...

241
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:46,473
Naruto, <i>I am the leader of this team...

242
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:49,312
Okay, okay. I got it!

243
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,555
There's no way
I can sleep so early...

244
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:58,754
Yeah, right...

245
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:02,192
All that complaining and guess
who's the first one to fall asleep?

246
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:33,725
I have to pee...

247
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:46,735
Huh?

248
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:47,870
Huh?

249
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,504
What's that?

250
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:00,618
It's a waterfall...

251
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,716
Hey... Is somebody there?

252
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:28,777
S Say...

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,617
Damn it...!

254
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:37,155
S Sorry. Did I scare you?

255
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,319
Huh?

256
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,225
There's nobody there...

257
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,768
Huh, Naruto...
Did you catch a cold?

258
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,173
Yeah... a little...

259
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,840
After sleeping so much
you're still tired?

260
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:02,538
Well, uh...

261
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,743
When I woke up last night to pee,
I saw something awesome...

262
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,080
Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?

263
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,351
No, I'm okay...

264
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,651
And... what was that awesome thing?

265
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:15,796
It was a beautiful woman
in the middle of the waterfall!

266
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:16,626
Huh?

267
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:20,995
When that person moved her arms,
the water would suddenly move too!

268
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:22,733
It was awesome!

269
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,135
And what happened then...

270
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,697
When I tried to speak to her,
she suddenly vanished.

271
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:30,676
You must have been dreaming
or something.

272
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,973
It's starting to feel that way...

273
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,449
You idiot!

274
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:40,045
Your face is red, Hinata.

275
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,913
You might have really
caught a cold.

276
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:44,348
Huh... really, I'm fine...

277
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:52,694
This fruit is edible.
This will be our meal today.

278
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:54,330
Got it.

279
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:58,597
We can save on
our food supplies too.

280
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,637
There's one thing
I need to warn you about.

281
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:05,471
On rare occasions, this fruit grows
to the size of a human being.

282
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,408
However, those fruits
are damaged inside.

283
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,113
Don't tamper with them
under any circumstance.

284
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,616
There's nobody who would
eat something that huge.

285
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:14,220
N -Naruto...!

286
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:17,149
He's eating it...

287
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,865
Naruto... We're going on ahead...

288
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,562
I'II... I'll be right behind you!

289
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,039
Sorry to keep you waiting!

290
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,809
Wait just a second!

291
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:08,036
Hey... aren't w e there yet?

292
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:10,806
Yes.

293
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:12,776
We're here!

294
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:13,606
What...?

295
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,681
Wow!

296
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,717
I've never seen anything
like this before.

297
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:29,123
This certainly isn't a place
where humans could inhabit.

298
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:32,633
That's right...
That's why it's paradise for insects.

299
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,699
D-Don't tell me...

300
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:38,839
Could it be that... over there...?

301
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,338
You mean that's where
the Bikochu are?

302
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:44,706
No problem.
It's better than the Chunin Exam.

303
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:53,014
Damn... The foothold crumbles easily...

304
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:54,485
- Naruto...
- What?

305
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:57,852
As the leader, I'm warning you...

306
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,026
At a time like this,
what is it?!

307
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:01,524
Don't fall.

308
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:05,324
I already know that
without your telling me!

309
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,097
Naruto!

310
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:11,432
No way...!

311
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,173
That was close...

312
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,680
Those were insects, huh...

313
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,774
That's why I warned you.

314
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,081
When this mission is over,

315
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:29,589
I'm definitely gonna kick
that guy's butt!

316
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:38,061
This is... the Bikochu forest.

317
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,364
Let's go.

318
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:57,716
There's no mistake.
Those are Leaf Shinobi.

319
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,312
The fact that those guys came to
a place like this

320
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:02,117
means their objective is...

321
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:07,255
Yeah... it's the same as ours...
the Bikochu.

322
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:09,592
We're not gonna let them
take any Bikochu.

323
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:14,764
The Bikochu...
belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!

324
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:32,882
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

325
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:36,355
<i>And you become speechless</i>

326
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,355
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

327
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,593
<i>So you don't answer</i>

328
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:51,296
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

329
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:56,173
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

330
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:58,678
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

331
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:07,882
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

332
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:17,489
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

333
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:26,667
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

334
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:38,479
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

335
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,459
Huh! If you're talking about
the insect in this photograph,

336
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:54,660
I'm very familiar with it.

337
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,066
- Huh?
- Really?!

338
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:59,573
Damn... Don't tell me
that was a Bikochu?

339
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:01,298
Where did you see it?

340
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,844
I heard some rustling in the kitchen
in the middle of the night,

341
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:04,935
and I unintentionally threw
a slipper at it...

342
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:05,637
Wait a second...

343
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:07,146
N -Naruto...

344
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:10,946
What you're talking about
is an ordinary cockroach.

345
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:16,589

Don't All Insects Look A like?"
