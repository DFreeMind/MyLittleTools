Subtitles By: BakaSan

2
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,225
I will become the Hokage!

3
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:51,826
I can't lose a battle like this!

4
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:56,195
Shut up! You can't even keep up with my speed at all!!

5
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,003
U!

6
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,683
Zu! Ma! Ki!

7
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,610
Naruto Combo!

8
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,561
The winner is Uzumaki Naruto.

9
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,968
I am... getting stronger!

10
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,933
Wow! Good! Great job!

11
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,332
That Naruto beat Kiba!

12
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,857
This is a big surprise, isn't it?

13
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:02,008
Opening of the Byakugan!! A big decision of Shy Hinata!

14
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,668
This medicine is really good!

15
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,888
Hey, don't you want to use this, too, Sakura-chan?

16
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:21,690
It's only you to have your wounds heal that quickly...Naruto.

17
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:26,378
I've been surprised by Kyubi (nine-tails) power, as always.

18
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:43,710
He..hey...

19
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,655
This is a medicine cream for your wounds... for you and Akamaru

20
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,159
You’d better start worrying about
yourself, instead of somebody else.

21
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:13,292
The rest is you, Choji, Neji, Lee, the Sand (Suna)
ninja, and one Oto (Sound) ninja... Only 6 people left.

22
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:16,245
Listen, Hinata

23
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,676
If your opponent is the Sand guy, forfeit immediately

24
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,986
And one more...

25
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:26,339
do the same if it's a match against Neji,

26
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:28,180
forfeit immediately

27
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,195
that guy is too harsh for you

28
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,940
you'll be beaten up like an old rag

29
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,347
Alright... I'll announce the next match

30
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:47,137
Hyuga Hinata VS. Huga Neji

31
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:51,225
Dammit!

32
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:52,831
Hinata

33
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:57,317
This is a very interesting match up...

34
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:18,588
I never imagined I'd go against you, Hinata-sama

35
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,173
Neji-brother

36
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:21,554
Brother?!

37
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,141
What? Those two are ... siblings?

38
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:36,582
They are from the oldest distinguished
family in Konoha, the Hyuga clan

39
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,266
but, they're not siblings

40
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:42,049
Then, what kind of relationship do they have?

41
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:50,734
Hmm... well... I probably can say
that... they are Hyuga's Souke and Bunke.

42
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,294
Souke and Bunke?

43
00:05:54,046 --> 00:06:00,125
Yes. Hinata-san is from Hyuga's
Souke, the main stream of the Hyuga family

44
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,146
and Neji is from Bunke, the branch
family that shares the same blood.

45
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:06,546
That means, this match is between relatives.

46
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:09,454
This would be a hard one for those two to fight.

47
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:12,176
Exactly... But..

48
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:13,577
But what?

49
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,632
There have been so many things between Souke (main
family) and Bunke (branch family) for a long time.

50
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,873
They are not in a good relationship these days.

51
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,698
Hmmm... Why?

52
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,498
I don't know exactly why...

53
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:26,441
But...

54
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:31,737
the old distinguished Shinobi (ninja)
families such as the Hyuga and the Uchiha,

55
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,059
have the clan's special techniques and capabilities

56
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:40,834
To protect and pass down those, I've
heard that the Hyuga set some rules...

57
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,413
but many of those rules are advantages for the Souke...

58
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:51,223
There've been so many problems between Souke and
Bunke, because of those rules... That's what I've heard.

59
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:56,149
Then, this would be a battle of their fate.

60
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:05,923
Hey... It'll begin.

61
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,582
Please begin the match now.

62
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,220
Before we start the match ...

63
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,099
I want to warn one thing to Hinata-sama.

64
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,386
Forfeit!

65
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,276
Being a Shinobi is not for you!

66
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:27,811
You're too kind...

67
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,085
You desire peace, avoid conflicts, and don't
hesitate to agree with somebody else's opinions.

68
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,750
And, you don't have self confidence.

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,486
You always feel that you're inferior.

70
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:44,830
That's why you don't mind just being a Genin.

71
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:49,074
But the Chunin exam requires three
people together in the team to take.

72
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,729
You couldn't say no to your teammates Kiba.

73
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:56,153
The truth is you are taking this
exam even though you don't want to.

74
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:57,769
Am I wrong?

75
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:01,018
You're wrong! That's wrong...

76
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,114
I... I just wanted to...

77
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,665
...wanted to change myself from what
you just described. I voluntarily...

78
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,897
Hinata...

79
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,616
Stand up, Hanabi.

80
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:36,315
Hinata will start working under my supervision...

81
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,210
But, is it really ok for you?

82
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,641
Isn't Hinata the heir to the Huyga clan?

83
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,970
The missions done by Genin always are close to death.

84
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:51,955
Do whatever you like!

85
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,307
This failure, who is inferior to the 5-year younger Hanabi...

86
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,341
is not wanted in this Hyuga clan!

87
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:11,745
If you've finished your business, please leave now.

88
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,345
You're disturbing us.

89
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,481
Hinata is trying to change herself in her own way...

90
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:45,299
Hinata-sama... You're surely just
a overprotected brat from Souke.

91
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,406
It's never possible for a person to change!

92
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,087
A looser is always a looser...

93
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:56,937
Your character and power will never change!

94
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,128
That guy...!

95
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,979
Because a person can never change, they are born as they are...

96
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:16,932
...terms like elite and looser are created.

97
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:23,296
Everybody judges others by how good the person's
face, brain, skills, body structures, and character..

98
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:24,392
and will always be judged by these.

99
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,737
These are unchangeable factors...

100
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:31,797
People struggle and live with these factors in their own way.

101
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:39,150
Just like we can't change the fact
that you're from Souke and I'm from Bunke.

102
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,951
I've seen through so many things with my Byakudan...

103
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,032
That's why I know!

104
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,516
You're pretending to be strong...

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,980
Your real desire is to run away from here immediately.

106
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,827
No! You're wrong! I really want to...!

107
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,139
Byakudan?

108
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:05,450
It's said that Uchiha clan's origin
can traced back to the Hyuga clan.

109
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:11,081
The Byakugan is one of the traits that
the Hyuga clan has passed down.

110
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,666
It's the special-eye similar to Sharingan.

111
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:19,698
But if you talk only about the power to see through
things, it's much more powerful than Sharingan.

112
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:32,282
Byakugan!

113
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:35,123
Hyuga Hinata VS Hyuga Neji

114
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,240
You can't fool my eyes!

115
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:34,687
Just now, your eye went to upper-left due to my will.

116
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:41,763
This is the sign that you're recalling
your past... your unpleasant past!

117
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:46,278
And your eyes moved down to lower right immediately after that.

118
00:12:47,485 --> 00:13:00,480
That is the sign that you're
imagining physical and mental pains.

119
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,487
Your loss, that's what you imagined!

120
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:17,010
The reaction that you put your arms in front of your body...

121
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:23,298
...shows that you want to create a wall
and want to have some distance between me.

122
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:29,257
These movements you make tells me that you don't
want me to dig into your real thoughts anymore...

123
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,665
Because all that I've said was all true!

124
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,173
Furthermore...

125
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,575
Your finger touching your lips is one
way to show that you're relentless.

126
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:52,743
It's an instinct to protect yourself, trying
to soften the tension and stress.

127
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,980
In fact, aren't you aware about this?

128
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,309
Changing yourself can NEVER...

129
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:10,637
...be done! Can be DONE!

130
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,837
Don't decide what the other person is, dumbass!

131
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,991
Beat this guy up, Hinata!

132
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:36,562
Hinata! Say something back to him a little!

133
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:38,977
It makes ME agitated!

134
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,401
That's a noisy guy...

135
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:11,044
Naruto-kun... Thank you.

136
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,755
Her eyes changed.

137
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:22,168
So, you won't forfeit? I'm not
responsible what'll happen to you.

138
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:24,584
I...

139
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,119
I won't run away!

140
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:29,703
...never again...

141
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,998
I will never bend my words. That's my Ninja way!

142
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,462
Don't want to run away!

143
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:40,290
Byakugan!

144
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,488
Neji-brother...

145
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:54,320
Let's fight!

146
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,319
Ah... that is...

147
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:07,734
OK

148
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,981
As I thought... the same Hyuga style

149
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,313
Her stance is exactly same as Neji's

150
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,945
Hyuga style?

151
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,169
The Konoha's strongest Taijutsu style ...

152
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,729
Didn't I tell you before...

153
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:32,194
that the most strongest Genin in Konoha is in my team.

154
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,850
That guy is ... Hyuga Neji!

155
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,838
HERE!

156
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:33,996
She got him!

157
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:36,156
No. It's too soft!

158
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,407
No. It's enough to just blush.

159
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:44,145
That's why the Hyuga clan is called the strongest in Konoha.

160
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:46,292
What do you mean?

161
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:51,340
The Hyuga has its own special Taijutsu that's been passed down.

162
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,254
The Taijutsu that I and Lee specialize in...

163
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:05,540
is breaking opponents bones and
injuring them from outside by attacking.

164
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,402
It's called Goken (Iron fist).  On the other hand...

165
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:13,480
the Hyuga gives internal damages
to the channel that Chakura flows...

166
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:17,625
and destroy from the inside.

167
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,025
They are the clan to use the Soft-hand.

168
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:25,266
It's not flashy to watch, but it
will get you little by little later.

169
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:29,539
Well... nobody can train their organs.

170
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:34,035
Even a strongest guy will be at the
risk with one hit of the Soft-hand.

171
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,015
Even I can ...

172
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,104
Hinata's in advantage!

173
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:56,630
You're doing Great! Hinata!

174
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:59,102
Attacking the inner channel?

175
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:02,284
What are those people?

176
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:08,092
Hey, hey... Ah.. What is the Chakura channel?

177
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,320
Again? Another question from the stupid one...

178
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,018
I will explain.

179
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:23,597
The Chakura channel is like pipes that carries Chakura
to everywhere in one's body, just like blood vessels.

180
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,547
Ah.. it's like a Chakura highway.

181
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:35,415
Yes. Plus, those channels are closely wrapping
the inner organs that build up the Chakura.

182
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:40,882
So, if the channels are attacked, those
inner organs also get damaged.

183
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,434
Oh, you've got some smarts!

184
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,525
Hey! Don't talk like that to your sempai(older person)!

185
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:58,404
Understandable...

186
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:04,322
The biggest opponent to Lee is... that boy.

187
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,461
Sensei, why can they do such a thing?

188
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,324
The Chakura channel can't be visible to eyes...

189
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:17,151
How do they attack the Chakura channel within one's body?

190
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,535
No. With the eyes of those two...

191
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,447
the channels can be seen by using the Byakugan.

192
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:33,559
Also, the Soft-hand attack is a
bit different from the regular ones.

193
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:39,495
They release their own Chakura from the hole in their hand...

194
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:45,656
and make it flow into the other's body which gives
the damage directly to the opponent’s chakura channel.

195
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:49,567
Alright!

196
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,319
Did she do it?
