1
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:16,902
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,498
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:26,338
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:29,610
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,815
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:40,190
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:45,564
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:49,159
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,537
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:55,540
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:59,908
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:02,377
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:08,251
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:11,991
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,323
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:19,195
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,460
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,002
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,437
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:47,053
<i>Ton Ton, I'm Counting on You!</i>

21
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,365
Kurenai Sensei! Asuma Sensei!

22
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,966
W What happened?!

23
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,638
N -Naruto...

24
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:12,912
There they are!

25
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,449
Hurry!

26
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:17,354
The Medical Corps...?

27
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,494
There's no time to lose!

28
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,460
As soon as they have received
emergency treatment...

29
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:26,521
transport them immediately!

30
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:31,696
<i>What in the world...happened?</i>

31
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,539
Don't concern yourself
with the other prisoners!

32
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:41,470
We need to focus solely
on Mizuki! Got it?!

33
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:42,879
- Roger!
- Roger!

34
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,619
Ton Ton, we're close, right?!

35
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:56,219
There they are!

36
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:59,021
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

37
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,429
It can't be...!

38
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,534
Fuujin... Raijin!

39
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,804
These two are Fuujin and Raijin?

40
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,698
They'll do us in
if we lower our guard!

41
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,243
Elder Brother...

42
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,609
which do you prefer,
pork cutlet or ginger pork?

43
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:15,680
I want both.

44
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,943
Hey you... Where is Mizuki?!

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,111
Seems like I'm popular...

46
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,689
<i>When did he sneak in?</i>
<i>This isn't good!</i>

47
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:46,273
<i>Damn... Just when I thought things</i>
<i>had quieted down, this happens.</i>

48
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,973
<i>That guy is a tough one to handle.</i>

49
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:50,916
<i>Orochimaru...</i>

50
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:59,481
I wish to report that
we have managed to take

51
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,186
both Kurenai and Asuma
under our protection...

52
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:04,357
I see... Good work.

53
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:07,193
Hidden Leaf Hospital

54
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,131
Looks like I underestimated them a little.
My apologies.

55
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,704
No... This is really embarrassing.
I let my guard down.

56
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,579
I didn't think that all the inmates
would break out of prison.

57
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,075
And moreover, the guards
were taken as hostages.

58
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,486
What happened afterwards?

59
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,024
I believe that this last prison
break incident

60
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:36,357
was not an unexpected occurrence...

61
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:40,595
While that large number of inmates
was escaping from prison,

62
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,828
he utilized that unguarded moment
to slip away.

63
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,363
That jerk Mizuki...!

64
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:48,603
- Hey!
- Old Lady Tsunade!

65
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:49,836
S Stop!

66
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:53,473
You were talking about Orochimaru,
weren't you?!

67
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,078
That's why you sent
the Sensei there, right?

68
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,645
<i>I don't know, however...</i>

69
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,418
<i>the handwriting resembles the document</i>
<i>confiscated from the facility</i>

70
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:06,424
<i>where Orochimaru</i>
<i>was conducting human experiments...</i>

71
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,255
<i>Orochimaru...</i>

72
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,861
<i>This brat...was listening!</i>

73
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:20,636
Damn, forget it.

74
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:21,731
Let him go!

75
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:22,399
Yes ma'am!

76
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,882
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>I've got to find some kind of lead.</i>

77
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,812
Where do you intend to go
by yourself?

78
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:37,689
That goes without saying.
I'm going to bring Sasuke back!

79
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:40,826
Gimme a break...

80
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:42,986
At a time when
we don't have adequate troops...

81
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:47,897
and at a time when everybody else
is going all out to do their job, you...

82
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:53,335
All right.

83
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:58,672
I believe it's certain that Orochimaru
has been involved in this recent incident.

84
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:01,270
However...

85
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:05,244
The situation with Orochimaru
and Sasuke has already gone

86
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,786
beyond the point of being dealt with
on an individual level.

87
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:11,221
This isn't the kind of thing that you,
a Genin, could handle alone.

88
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,119
If you understand me,

89
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:16,354
go and do the mission
you are already assigned to!

90
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,696
What! Shizune is...?!

91
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:32,837
Ton Ton! Something has happened
to Shizune, hasn't it?!

92
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,374
I don't have any idea
what you're saying,

93
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,476
but Shizune is in trouble, right?!

94
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,214
Got it!

95
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:45,488
I know what my job right now is!

96
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,026
I'm gonna rescue Shizune

97
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:51,154
and make my way to wherever
Orochimaru is, no matter what!

98
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:55,390
And then I'm gonna slam
Orochimaru and bring Sasuke back!

99
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:58,428
You are...!

100
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:00,301
Show me the way, Ton Ton!

101
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,069
Naruto!

102
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:04,903
Damn! I need to take
urgent measures...

103
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,169
What's the matter?

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,876
Kakashi!

105
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:12,673
Well, I picked these guys up
on my way back from my mission.

106
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,877
The village is in quite a restless state.

107
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:17,254
Yes.

108
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:21,383
And... has Naruto done
something yet again?

109
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,331
<i>Even though it's only a tiny clue,</i>

110
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,833
<i>now there's finally something</i>
<i>that links to Orochimaru!</i>

111
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,501
Wait for me, Shizune!

112
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,601
I'm coming to your rescue!

113
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:41,074
<i>Naruto...</i>
<i>Where is he going in such a hurry?</i>

114
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,316
Fuujin, Raijin...
It's about time to head out!

115
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:49,651
- All right.
- All right!

116
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:57,355
M Mizuki...

117
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,603
<i>I'm gonna find him without fail!</i>

118
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,169
<i>Sasuke!</i>

119
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,578
Long time no see... Tsubaki.

120
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,350
That woman captain was
pretty tenacious, wasn't she?

121
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:30,796
Thanks to her, I'm starving,
Elder Brother.

122
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,395
I can't stop laughing!

123
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,428
Oh, it stopped.

124
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,566
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

125
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:46,569
Haven't seen this vista
for quite a while.

126
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,212
Y Yes...

127
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,780
Elder Brother, this rice is hard!

128
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,453
Idiot! It's one and the same once
it's inside your stomach!

129
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,851
I see... you're awesome, Elder Brother.

130
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,154
What's this?
It's gotten all raggedy.

131
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,657
You need to buy a new one.

132
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:03,720
Yes.

133
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:06,798
What's the matter, Tsubaki?

134
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,030
I noticed some Black Ops
in the mountains earlier.

135
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,562
In a secluded place
in the mountains like this!

136
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:19,808
I see.

137
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,113
You won't tell me anything, will you?

138
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:34,354
To you, the Leaf Village looks just
like it did before, doesn't it, Mizuki?

139
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:37,091
However...

140
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:42,966
Alot of people died while
you were away, Mizuki.

141
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:46,433
This rice soup is great,
huh, Elder Brother?

142
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,338
Yeah... Very different from the institution.

143
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:52,169
Are you leaving again?

144
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah...

145
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,038
Stop!

146
00:09:56,615 --> 00:10:01,143
Please, Mizuki! Please end
your involvement with Orochimaru!

147
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:08,649
Because of Orochimaru,
many people died!

148
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:13,825
Because of Orochimaru,
the Leaf Village was in shambles!

149
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,656
Even the Third Hokage was...

150
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,267
Only if you hadn't gotten involved
with Orochimaru, Mizuki,

151
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:23,840
you and I would now...

152
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:31,180
Everything will be fine, Tsubaki.

153
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,981
This time, I won't make the mistake

154
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,351
of having that Nine Tailed brat
get in my way.

155
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,454
And then...

156
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:42,091
That boy fought for the Leaf
when Orochimaru attacked!

157
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,257
That Nine Tailed brat did...?

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,365
<i>That brat did...?!</i>

159
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:57,608
That's right. He's not some scary kid
like you said he was!

160
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:00,741
So please stop with
your foolish ideas!

161
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:05,550
It's already over!
It's all already over! So...

162
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:13,954
No... It's not over yet!

163
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:18,090
So that Nine Tailed brat is
acting the hero, huh?

164
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,888
Don't make me laugh!

165
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:24,066
Half-wits as always, huh!
Those Leaf guys!

166
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,502
Mizuki...?!

167
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:27,596
Come!

168
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:32,705
I will get my hands on
Orochimaru's ultimate power!

169
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,303
And will teach this village
a lesson!

170
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:39,877
Power...
Orochimaru's ultimate power!

171
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:47,192
If I do that...
You and I will have everything go our way!

172
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:52,529
Mizuki...

173
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,696
Mizuki!

174
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:57,836
Please...

175
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,096
Become the kind and gentle Mizuki
again just like before.

176
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:04,933
If you really love me...

177
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,302
don't do anything stupid!

178
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:10,544
Tsubaki...

179
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:23,487
All right then...

180
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,921
Well then,
I'll leave the rest in your hands.

181
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:27,857
Not so quickly!

182
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,200
Here you are! Next for you
is an S rank mission!

183
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:34,337
<i>She's a real slave driver.</i>

184
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,501
The Iruka Team...

185
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,545
has completed rounding up
the inmates.

186
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:43,546
Huh?! Kakashi Sensei!
I beg your pardon!

187
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:45,649
Don't worry about it.
Good work.

188
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:50,578
It looks like neither of us are going
to get a chance to rest, Iruka Sensei.

189
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,352
The Art of Summoning!

190
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,655
Hey, youngster...

191
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,097
Well, Iruka Sensei,
I'll leave the rest to you.

192
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,095
Huh? Huh?

193
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,507
Iruka, you have a mission.
Time is of the essence.

194
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,807
Y Yes, ma'am?

195
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,783
Let's hurry.
We've taken more time than anticipated.

196
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,649
Mizuki...

197
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:31,795
How about it, Ton Ton?

198
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:34,923
Here he comes!

199
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,494
W Wait, Naruto!

200
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,203
Iruka Sensei?!

201
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:42,438
Ton Ton?!

202
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,404
So this is what I smelled...

203
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,176
Thanks for your hard work, Ton Ton.

204
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,141
I'll look out for these two
from here onward,

205
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,812
so you go back to the village.

206
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,390
Brother Mizuki...
Shouldn't we be hurrying?

207
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,123
T To Orochimaru's?

208
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:13,237
That Nine Tailed brat...

209
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,903
<i>Don't you dare touch, Iruka Sensei!</i>

210
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:20,734
<i>Otherwise, I'll kill you!</i>

211
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:28,182
- <i>In that case, I'll go for it!</i>
- <i>In that case, I'll go for it!</i>

212
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,261
<i>I may have done</i>
<i>a little too much!</i>

213
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,597
Don't tell me that...

214
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:46,336
that failure of a Nine-Tailed brat is...

215
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,504
Elder Brother...
Do Nine-Tails taste good?

216
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,208
Yeah... I'm sure they're good.

217
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,645
Iruka Sensei, you didn't come here
just to drag me home?

218
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,176
Well, you're not the kind of guy
who would go back calmly

219
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,947
if I simply said
"Come back," are you!

220
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:06,284
You are right, Iruka Sensei!
You really know me, don't you!

221
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:08,583
Don't get carried away like that!

222
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,686
If you let your guard down
you'll get your fingers burned!

223
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:15,057
Huh? Did you find something?

224
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:19,464
Yeah... It's a bad inmate's smell!

225
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,205
Now then, what in the world
can I do with these now?

226
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,945
It smells like
we're getting pretty close now.

227
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:41,053
Shizune?!

228
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,384
A Are you all right?

229
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:45,861
N -Naruto?!

230
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,624
Prisoner's garb is scattered
about here and there.

231
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:53,798
It looks like somebody's trying
to buy time by deceiving my nose...

232
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,631
Mizuki was just one step away

233
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,335
and we ended up
letting them get away.

234
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,534
But I'm so glad you're safe.

235
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:00,373
Yeah...

236
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,407
My comrades are pursing Mizuki.
Let's hurry!

237
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:04,845
Okay.

238
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:06,347
This smells!

239
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,911
There's a strong smell
of prisoners wafting.

240
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:12,848
It's Mizuki and the others!
There's no mistake!

241
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,721
All right! We're almost there!

242
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,461
But... if we enter the basin
just like this

243
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,021
it will make it easy for
the enemy to attack from the plateau.

244
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,728
It would be safer to make a detour

245
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,462
and make our way up
to the top of a hill.

246
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,094
What are you talking about?!

247
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:29,436
We have a really good open view,
so we'll be fine!

248
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,938
Hmm... Those guys are trying to buy time.

249
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,811
If we make a detour, we may not
be able to catch up with them!

250
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,576
Damn!

251
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:45,354
How could I have fallen
for such a trap?!

252
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:46,756
Be careful, Naruto!

253
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:50,222
This time, it's not a dummy.
A real entity is lurking there!

254
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:51,690
A rock?!

255
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:02,030
- Yippee!
- Thank you for the meal!

256
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:08,034
Naruto! Behind you!

257
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,174
Shizune!

258
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,642
W Why is Shizune...?

259
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,616
Move away, Naruto!
That's a fake!

260
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,685
What a delight to see you
after such a long time...

261
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,387
Iruka... Naruto!

262
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,123
Iruka Sensei, who's that guy?!

263
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,699
It's Mizuki, Naruto.

264
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:32,828
Mizuki?! But he seems very
different from before!

265
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:36,071
That's right, I remember that failure who
in his Academy days

266
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,769
couldn't even master
a decent Transformation Jutsu!

267
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,141
Damn! He's pissing me off!

268
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:44,138
How's that, Iruka?
You hardly recognize me, do you?

269
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:47,850
<i>It's true that</i>
<i>there's no comparison with before...</i>

270
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:51,783
Thanks to being confined in
that sordid and boring prison cell

271
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:53,825
I was able to concentrate
on my ascetic training.

272
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,626
I thank you, Iruka...

273
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:58,223
When did you realize it was me?

274
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,465
When we rescued you while
you pretended to be Shizune,

275
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,058
you said,
"My colleagues are pursuing Mizuki."

276
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,603
The only time a subordinate leaves the
team leader behind to pursue the enemy

277
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:09,903
would be when the team leader had
either died or was near death...

278
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:12,640
But you had incurred only
slight injuries.

279
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:15,875
A textbook answer.

280
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,173
And also, you didn't say anything

281
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,048
when I suggested making
a detour from our route.

282
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,448
If your subordinates were in pursuit,

283
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:26,491
it would be a safer strategy to watch
the enemy's movements from a plateau!

284
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,925
Sharp as you are, you used
the prisoner's garb as a decoy

285
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:36,661
not to gain time,
but to lead us into this trap!

286
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:40,561
Wow... Your power of analysis
is as good as always.

287
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,766
Makes me remember the old days!

288
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,599
Mizuki... Stop with the stupid act!

289
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:50,375
You have no idea of
the hardships I've endured!

290
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,443
Fuujin! Raijin! Do it!

291
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,886
- Yippee!
- Yippee!

292
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,648
- Come on!
- Stop it, Naruto!

293
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:59,148
Your opponent is me!

294
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,393
Get away, Naruto!

295
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:05,388
I'll be fine, Iruka Sensei!

296
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,964
Naruto?!

297
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:11,264
So you have the leeway
to look away, do you?!

298
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:13,167
Flee... Naruto!

299
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,272
Damn!

300
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,276
I'm not gonna lose!

301
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,539
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

302
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:30,116
What?!

303
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:34,450
It's the same face here and over too.

304
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,986
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

305
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:42,099
Elder Brother, I don't have
enough fingers to count them all!

306
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,894
You idiot, Raijin.
Use my hands too!

307
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,404
Wow! You're so smart, Fuujin...

308
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,370
Wh-What the hell are
those guys about?!

309
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,104
Don't get in the way!

310
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,405
I have business with Mizuki!

311
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,977
Elder Brother,
he said we were in the way.

312
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:02,946
But take a look! Elder Brother!
Mizuki looks busy.

313
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,551
That's true. He looks busy.

314
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,088
And also, if we go back just like this

315
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,063
we won't be able to eat
a sumptuous meal!

316
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:16,366
That's right.
I forgot about the sumptuous meal!

317
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,429
- Sumptuous meal!
- Sumptuous meal!

318
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,299
I feel a little thrown off balance.

319
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:26,275
Let's regroup, everybody!

320
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:27,570
Go!

321
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,954
I'm itchy, Elder Brother...

322
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,196
Yeah, itchy...

323
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:58,571
My punches aren't having
any effect whatsoever...

324
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:32,072
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

325
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:35,545
<i>And you become speechless</i>

326
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:41,544
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

327
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,783
<i>So you don't answer</i>

328
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:50,486
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

329
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:55,363
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

330
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,868
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

331
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:07,072
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

332
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:16,679
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

333
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:25,857
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

334
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:37,669
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

335
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,654
Damn! What are these two?!

336
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,052
They're not just big!

337
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,994
They can't be beat with
just technique and Jutsu!

338
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:02,628
Just when I need to get Mizuki!

339
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:06,528
In any case,
I can't waste time onwith them!

340
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:10,132
I have to circumvent them somehow
and beat'em to the punch!

341
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:14,343
