1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:03,451
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:06,286
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:12,388
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:28,847
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,981
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,492
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,019
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:51,659
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:56,700
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,775 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:07,550
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,714
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:19,527
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,124
Naruto!

16
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:52,993
There was an emergency transmission
from the training room!

17
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,963
What in the world happened?!

18
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,762
Actually, the star was stolen.

19
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,371
The enemy is a Ninja
who flies using Chakra!

20
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,365
No way...!

21
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:07,309
I've never heard of
a flying Shinobi.

22
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:09,743
Byakugan!

23
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:34,170
I lost him...

24
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:37,403
But what Naruto said is true.

25
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,705
To think he can fly
using Chakra...

26
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:41,606
That's an incredible Shinobi.

27
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,772
So it was true.

28
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,977
What?! You didn't believe
what I said?!

29
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:47,882
You could say that.

30
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:49,921
Wh What's up with that?

31
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:52,218
Do I have that little credibility?!

32
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,293
<i>The Remembered Lullaby</i>

33
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,699
So the star of
the Village Hidden in Stars

34
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:09,536
is a meteorite, huh?

35
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:13,237
Yes...

36
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,042
The First Hoshikage...

37
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,487
That's what they call
the village leader.

38
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,817
He discovered that if
you train by the "star..."

39
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:30,885
Chakra is strengthened.

40
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,333
Ever since then...

41
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:38,435
the Hidden Star has been
in a unique position

42
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,302
even among the Ninja hidden villages.

43
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,971
But it says in these documents

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,533
that the training hasn't been conducted
these past ten years...

45
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:49,307
The leader who called himself
the Third Hoshikage

46
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,973
prohibited the training...

47
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,078
But about a year ago...

48
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,684
It seems they started again
after that Hoshikage died...

49
00:03:56,922 --> 00:04:00,517
But why? Why do something
like prohibit training...?

50
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,789
Who knows...?

51
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:05,124
It's a classified matter of
the Village Hidden in the Stars, so...

52
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:09,292
But there were various rumors
circulating around about it...

53
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:10,527
Rumors?

54
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:16,305
Yeah... Rumors about most
of the Ninjas who trained dying...

55
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:21,872
Chakra is forcibly strengthened
by the power of the unknown star.

56
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:25,981
There may have been
adverse effects on the body.

57
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,495
What...?

58
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,994
The star was stolen?!

59
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:49,063
Yes! The people who were
training were at the scene,

60
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,234
but they were all knocked out
by an enemy Jutsu...

61
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:53,502
Pathetic!

62
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,546
You say that,
but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!

63
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,319
Naruto, is it that incredible?

64
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:04,420
Yeah! Turning Chakra
into monsters or wings.

65
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,420
It's the first time I ever saw that!

66
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:11,228
Is that true... Sumaru?

67
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,287
Yes!

68
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,926
It's the Ninja Art: Kujaku,
no mistake!

69
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,204
That's the Jutsu passed on
in the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?

70
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:27,335
Yeah... As for that Jutsu, only those
who have mastered the star training can...

71
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,242
Sumaru!

72
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:30,311
Tenten...

73
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:34,452
The secrets of a Jutsu are not to
be spoken of or asked about lightly.

74
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:38,648
Especially with a Jutsu that can only
be passed on to those of that village...

75
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,281
I'm sorry...

76
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,490
Lord Akahoshi,
please give me an order!

77
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,859
The star being stolen
is my responsibility.

78
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:50,961
No...

79
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:53,234
The star was stolen

80
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,738
even though we were commissioned
a mission to protect it.

81
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:56,433
It's also our responsibility.

82
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,743
We will get the star back by
our own hands, no matter what!

83
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,238
Yes... I will leave the search for
the star to the Leaf Shinobi...

84
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:07,808
Sumaru, you keep an eye
on your injured comrades.

85
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,648
But only those in the village
know village matters...!

86
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:11,654
It's an order!

87
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:27,160
Hey! Are your friends who got beaten up
by the enemy Ninja okay?

88
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:29,066
That's none of your business!

89
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:30,033
What...?!

90
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,943
At the end of the day,
you're still Ninja from some other village!

91
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,143
You're not my friends or anything!

92
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,343
What's with him?!

93
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:41,185
Neji, you're talking about
taking responsibility,

94
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,744
but we haven't even seen
the scene of the theft.

95
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,583
That's right...
And we don't have any leads.

96
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,720
No, we do.

97
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:51,657
You didn't pick up on it?

98
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,999
Akahoshi the village leader
knows something!

99
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,193
What do you mean by
knowing something?

100
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:58,461
Come to think of it,

101
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,300
when Sumaru was talking about
the Kujaku something or other,

102
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,533
his expression changed.

103
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:06,667
Then that means the culprit is
someone associated with this village?

104
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:09,770
So, like I said, what does this mean?!

105
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,946
I'll make a go around the village

106
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,951
and look for something that
could make for a lead.

107
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:17,785
Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over
that village leader called Akahoshi.

108
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:19,187
I understand!

109
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,416
Leave it to us!

110
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:24,117
I don't get it!
What the heck should I do?!

111
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,293
Let me see...
You investigate from Sumaru's angle.

112
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,764
All right! Leave Sumaru to me.

113
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,667
Then, I'm off for a run!

114
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,571
Same as always...

115
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:38,501
Naruto sure is
an impetuous person, isn't he?

116
00:07:56,862 --> 00:08:02,164
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?</i>

117
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:07,796
<i>Because I had a sad dream last night.</i>

118
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:14,306
<i>My eyes are red, from the tears I shed</i>

119
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:19,180
<i>Swollen as I cried...</i>

120
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:25,689
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?</i>

121
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:31,390
<i>I'm searching for a child</i>
<i>who has gone afar</i>

122
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:42,599
<i>My sad dreams come once more.</i>

123
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,779
Hey Sumaru!

124
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:53,617
What're you doing?!

125
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,246
Nothing! I was just looking
at the stars!

126
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:58,587
Stars?

127
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:03,285
Come to think of it,
you can see the stars well in this village.

128
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:06,463
That red star's sure pretty...

129
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:07,987
Natsuhiboshi...

130
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,762
It watches over me all the time...

131
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:12,995
Huh?

132
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:18,599
H-Hey... Hold it. I want to go
visit your friends.

133
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:19,971
Look, here...

134
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:23,979
I've brought the Hidden Leaf specialty
Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!

135
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:26,745
Go if you like!
It's right near the training room!

136
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:27,711
Huh?

137
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:33,084
A cold hearted guy as usual...

138
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,738
What? Is nobody here?

139
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,904
Sorry to bother you.

140
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,354
Where is everyone?

141
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,314
Oh, is somebody sleeping?

142
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:19,470
Stop it... Hokuto.

143
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:24,001
I can tell... He's not an enemy.

144
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:25,575
Mizura...!

145
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:26,802
You little!

146
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,848
Oh, ouch...

147
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:34,883
A girl...?

148
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,648
Who are you?

149
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,755
I'm a Ninja from the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!

150
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,894
I came to this village
to protect the star!

151
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,158
Y You are...?

152
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,497
I'm sorry for my rough behavior!

153
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,499
It's cool. I just came to visit...

154
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:57,235
Where's the Roasted
Chestnut Bean Jelly...?

155
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:02,377
Oh! That's it!

156
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:03,675
Oh, no!

157
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:06,949
There's no mistake...

158
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,187
Then it was that person who
made off with the star, after all...

159
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:14,619
So you're saying that one's still alive...?

160
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:16,884
Then this will be difficult.

161
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,553
That one being the final Ninja
completely trained

162
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,225
in the power of the star means...

163
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,229
Not an opponent we can handle
with the likes of our Jutsu!

164
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:26,662
Don't get flustered...

165
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:29,269
If the culprit is who we think it is,

166
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,367
we already hold that one's weakness
in our hands.

167
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:35,540
I get it...

168
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,542
Then let's grab that person up.

169
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:39,646
Wait...

170
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:48,986
First we must avert the eyes
of the annoying flies!

171
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,628
I'm sorry...
My name is Hokuto...

172
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,803
I felt Chakra from someone not
of this village...

173
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:01,401
I carelessly...

174
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,742
Well, the flavor won't change, so eat up.

175
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:11,878
Okay...

176
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,148
Oh my... It really is good!

177
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:20,515
Right? Right?

178
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,220
Say... What happened to the others?

179
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:29,089
The thief just put us to sleep...

180
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,332
There wasn't such a great deal
of damage.

181
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,398
I see.

182
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,040
You okay?

183
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,336
Thanks for saving my butt back there!

184
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:44,814
Is there something wrong with you?

185
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,547
No... nothing at all...

186
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:51,985
After Mizura began the star training,
he started to feel poorly...

187
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:54,352
Hokuto! Don't be talking about the star

188
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,859
to someone from another village!

189
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,926
Are you okay, Mizura...?!

190
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,261
I'm sorry. I got carried away...

191
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:07,431
Other village...
You guys are kind of cold hearted.

192
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,336
Especially that Sumaru guy...

193
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,598
I'm sorry...

194
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,069
But there's a reason
why Sumaru became like that.

195
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,006
What?

196
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:19,383
It happened ten years ago...

197
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:28,415
Sumaru's parents who
were protecting the star

198
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:33,489
were killed by Ninja from
some other village...

199
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:34,827
who came to steal the star.

200
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,301
So probably, he's...

201
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:42,496
So that's what it was about...
That's why he got like that.

202
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,338
So where is Sumaru...?
And where the other guys?

203
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,277
It seems everyone went
to take back the star.

204
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:56,644
Huh?!

205
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:58,317
Oh!

206
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,555
Naru... to?

207
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:15,495
They've come out.

208
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:16,566
Right...

209
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,934
We should take them on
fair and square here...

210
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,706
Idiot! There'd be no point
to surveillance!

211
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,647
I'm not much one for
sniffing around secretly.

212
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,744
Be quiet. They'll notice us!

213
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:36,917
Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to me...
Follow me quietly!

214
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:37,956
But...

215
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,061
It's a mission!

216
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:41,790
I understand...

217
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:42,961
Let's go!

218
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:44,960
Secretly, secretly...

219
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,113
It's okay... They haven't noticed.

220
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:03,552
But I get the feeling this kind of thing
goes against my Way of Ninja...

221
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,020
Don't complain!

222
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,521
Secretly, secretly...

223
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,354
You don't need to say secretly, secretly!

224
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,291
But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?

225
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:15,031
Uh oh...

226
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,829
Have we been noticed?

227
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:18,931
Wait...

228
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,552
It appears we weren't noticed...

229
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:39,580
Let's continue trailing them!

230
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,156
Right! They turned right!

231
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,829
R-Roger!

232
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:51,899
They vanished...

233
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,498
Did they give us the slip?

234
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,335
Could it be, they noticed us?

235
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,815
Wait...! We're not enemies!

236
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:10,050
That's right!

237
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:12,749
We came here on a mission from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

238
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:16,017
Oh ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?

239
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:19,886
Then aren't you guys trailing
the wrong people?

240
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,357
That might be so.

241
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,324
But there's the possibility that
you guys have transformed

242
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,994
into people from this village, so...

243
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,837
Brave words.

244
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:30,641
I apologize for the rudeness...

245
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,135
But now the star has been stolen.

246
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,405
And we don't have any leads...

247
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,346
So that's why
you were investigating us, huh...?

248
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,185
That was unnecessary...

249
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:46,183
Oh well... We will take back
the star with our own hands.

250
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:50,085
You guys just make sure
you don't get in our way!

251
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:52,924
They kind of tick me off...

252
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:55,025
But it's as Neji said...

253
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,996
It seems there's some kind
of secret in this village, eh?

254
00:16:58,469 --> 00:16:59,163
Seems so...

255
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,135
Everyone... join hands!

256
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:14,207
Listen up! Pick up the same
star Chakra as us!

257
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:41,907
There he is!

258
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:02,296
You can't cut a rope woven
with Chakra!

259
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:09,130
Give back the star!
That's our life!

260
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,914
Neji, have you seen Sumaru
and the others?

261
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:22,083
You weren't keeping watch of him?

262
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:27,691
Actually, it seems most of the guys
went out to look for the star.

263
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,021
I see...

264
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,861
Hey... is it okay to be all relaxed?

265
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,439
Hey, is something wrong?

266
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,169
There's massive Chakra
at the Valley of Death.

267
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,903
Did he appear again?!

268
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:49,877
Let's go!

269
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:50,606
All right!

270
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:30,879
G Give back our... star...

271
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:32,783
Give it back...

272
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:46,067
Hold it!

273
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,036
Eat this!

274
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,642
Ninja Art: Kujaku!

275
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:01,546
I won't let you get away!

276
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:06,784
Hold it!

277
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,157
Farewell!

278
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,651
Wh What?!

279
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,696
Damn you!

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,625
Wait!

281
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,366
Let me go! L et me go, I say!

282
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:20,334
Calm down!

283
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:23,532
Up ahead is the valley filled
with poison gas...

284
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,008
O Okay...

285
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:36,281
You would've been dead meat in
a few seconds without that mask on...

286
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,548
Damn it. We almost had him.

287
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,248
So that was the Shinobi
who stole the star?

288
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,992
Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!

289
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:47,562
Why? Why is it necessary
to go out of his way

290
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,896
to take Sumaru away although
he carried out his goal already?

291
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,436
Does that have something to do

292
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,972
with the star being targeted
ten years ago?

293
00:20:56,941 --> 00:21:02,311
At that time, it seems Sumaru's parents
got killed protecting the star.

294
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:03,441
What?!

295
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:29,839
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

296
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:36,511
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

297
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,119
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

298
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:58,999
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

299
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,098
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

300
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:11,080
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

301
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:17,986
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

302
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:24,756
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

303
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:31,530
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

304
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:38,207
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

305
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:45,241
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

306
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:54,689
We need to reinvestigate
the village leader and his relations.

307
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:58,022
Please leave it to me!
I've got an ace strategy.

308
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:59,221
A strategy?

309
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,091
I can't count on Tenten's
trailing Ninjutsu, can I?

310
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,190
What did you say?!

311
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,132
Do whatever you want.
Just follow through with it.

312
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:06,726
All right! Here I go!

313
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,271
We'll see how good you are.

314
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:09,498
Then, me, too...

315
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:10,563
Hold it, Naruto.

316
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:14,975

The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku"
