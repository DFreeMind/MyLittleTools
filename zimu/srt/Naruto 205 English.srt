1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:14,062
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:33,816
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:39,687
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:45,788
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:51,393
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,075
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:05,049
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:17,688
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:24,097
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:29,300
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:58,564
<i>This is my chance to show my master</i>
<i>the fruits of my training!</i>

12
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,985
They're both caught in a Genjutsu...

13
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,166
Yakumo?

14
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:36,204
Is that you, Yakumo?

15
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,117
So you were safe!

16
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,358
Help me!

17
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,667
It's okay now, Yakumo.

18
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,974
I'll protect you, no matter what!

19
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,768
Kurenai Sensei!

20
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:25,454
<i>Kurenai's Top Secret Mission.</i>
<i>The Promise with the Third Hokage</i>

21
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,992
The two who went in first
haven't come back, huh?

22
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,188
Sure enough, is Yakumo in
a state of awakening?

23
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,635
You two handle
Yakumo and Kurenai...

24
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,495
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

25
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,200
You handle the nuisance
that's heading this way.

26
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:46,134
Yes, sir!

27
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,081
What?!

28
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:04,361
Leave it to me...

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,624
That emblem...!

30
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,568
You're with the Kurama Clan...?!

31
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,572
Yuhi Kurenai...
Hand over Yakumo quietly.

32
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,775
What does the Kurama Clan
plan to do with Yakumo?!

33
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,311
This is a clan issue.

34
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,576
It doesn't concern you.

35
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,248
Yakumo is the child I've
taken custody of,

36
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
from the Third Hokage.

37
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,184
Then, by force...

38
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,090
No!

39
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,236
You can't escape now!

40
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,848
What's this?!

41
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,050
To think she'd make it look like
she got caught in a Genjutsu

42
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,613
and then trap us in
a Genjutsu...!

43
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,851
Damn it! Where'd she go?

44
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,594
It hurts...

45
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,527
You okay...?!

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,225
Wha?!

47
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,649
You jerk!

48
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,150
Oh, Naruto!

49
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,589
- Hey! Hold it.
- H Hey!

50
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,290
Take this!

51
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:47,795
What?!

52
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,769
Ow ow... Hm?!

53
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,338
This bean stalk is too damn big!

54
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,985
I I can't move...!

55
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,392
This is not good!

56
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,894
Naruto!

57
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:24,824
Die!

58
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,298
Shino!

59
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,000
What?!

60
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:33,873
Genjutsu doesn't work
on the insects...

61
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,109
Damn it.

62
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,142
Wh What...?!

63
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:52,425
He vanished?!

64
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,731
There!

65
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,894
No matter where you hide,
you can't cover up your scent!

66
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:02,899
Man Beast Clone!

67
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,566
Fang Over Fang!

68
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:12,715
Yes!

69
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,448
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

70
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:26,527
No chance a half baked Genjutsu would
work on us fully trained Ninja!

71
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:27,586
Stop!

72
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,065
- Huh?
- Let go, let go! L et me go!

73
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,733
Jeez!

74
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,203
- Naruto!
- Let go!

75
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:36,870
Release!

76
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,807
What?! Sakura...

77
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:48,978
Morning...

78
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,687
It's because you charge right
into an enemy's Jutsu on your own.

79
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,188
Oh! Kurenai Sensei and Yakumo?!

80
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,420
Kurenai Sensei!

81
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,928
Who're these people?!

82
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,404
All four of them have been caught in
a Genjutsu and are unconscious.

83
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:14,743
Kurenai Sensei!

84
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:19,543
S Sensei... Kurenai Sensei!

85
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,920
She's nowhere to be found!

86
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:26,915
Byakugan!

87
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:33,956
What is it?!

88
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,993
K-Kurenai Sensei has...

89
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,472
<i>There's one left...</i>

90
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,447
<i>Just like that...</i>
<i>To think they'd cast a Genjutsu on me.</i>

91
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:56,946
Release!

92
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:58,819
What?! It won't wear off?!

93
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,396
It's Unkai who served as
the replacement leader

94
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,632
of the Kurama Clan
after my father died.

95
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:20,566
Unkai from the Kurama Clan...
I see.

96
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,845
Things won't go as they did
with the others, eh?

97
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,514
Kurenai Yuhi, Genjutsu user.

98
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:30,247
I'm embarrassed to be praised by you...

99
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,555
I'd like to avoid needless battle.

100
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,158
Hand over Yakumo.

101
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:41,031
Hang on tight.

102
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,098
You may very well be
Kurenai Yuhi,

103
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,763
but how do you intent
to fight within my Jutsu?!

104
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,278
Oh, no!

105
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,246
Damn you!

106
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:08,650
I smell blood!

107
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,191
Heh, I won't let you escape...

108
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:20,969
There!

109
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,781
Next, I'll pierce your heart...

110
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,917
Hand over Yakumo.
Why do you protect her?!

111
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:48,364
Kurenai Sensei!

112
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,410
I won't let you touch Kurenai Sensei!

113
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:05,643
Look out!

114
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:09,180
Wha?! Not again!

115
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,953
Geez, when will you
ever learn, Naruto?!

116
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,550
Byakugan!

117
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,155
Naruto! The enemy's above you!

118
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:19,922
Huh?!

119
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,068
Byakugan, huh?!

120
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,271
If you're coming at me
with Genjutsu, then...

121
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:29,872
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

122
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:33,707
Go!

123
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,244
Clones, huh?!

124
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,544
Heh! Mine aren't just illusions.

125
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:44,548
Let's go!

126
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:45,451
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

127
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:52,693
U zu ma ki!

128
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,862
Naruto Barrage!

129
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,667
I'll definitely get Yakumo...

130
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,010
Byakugan!

131
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:33,366
Yakumo has been sedated to calm
her nerves and is asleep now.

132
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,865
But it would be best for her

133
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,840
to have a complete examination
back at the village hospital.

134
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:41,405
It was a big help having
you here, Sakura.

135
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,538
You should also get
some first aid treatment, Sensei.

136
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,614
Right... Thanks.

137
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,281
Okay, please show me.

138
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,991
They've been like this the whole time.

139
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:01,988
It doesn't look like they'll wake up
from the Genjutsu

140
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,294
for quite a while...

141
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:06,132
Well, I guess that serves
our interests better. Hm?

142
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,367
It's...!

143
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:13,967
Kurenai Sensei!

144
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,114
Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!

145
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,186
Y Yes...

146
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,019
She's not okay!

147
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:27,051
Wha?!

148
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:31,484
I gave her some first aid treatment,
but she has a deep wound.

149
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,159
We must get back to the village quickly...

150
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,057
Don't worry about me.

151
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,431
I'm more concerned about
Yakumo's instability.

152
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:42,696
Yeah, their comrades could
very well return.

153
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:44,235
I'm also concerned about

154
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:48,438
how we haven't seen the three people
who were assigned to guard Yakumo.

155
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,710
All right!

156
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:53,750
Leave this to me and all of you
head back to the village

157
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,308
with Kurenai and Yakumo!

158
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,517
Organize a back up unit.

159
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,714
Your opponents are practitioners
of Genjutsu.

160
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,485
Will you be okay alone?

161
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,323
What?

162
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:04,721
This fully...

163
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,524
...trained body!

164
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:13,362
I would cram by the likes
of the Kurama Clan's Genjutsu!

165
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:19,932
A pun?

166
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:29,609
Oh?

167
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,848
Are you awake?

168
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,190
Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei
for sealing your Genjutsu?!

169
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:47,426
That person hates me...

170
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:53,573
She didn't want to make me into
a practitioner of Genjutsu.

171
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:56,075
It's not like that!

172
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:57,373
Then... why?!

173
00:14:57,515 --> 00:15:00,780
I'm sure she had some kind
of reason!

174
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,545
You would've been in trouble
had Kurenai Sensei

175
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:06,317
not risked her life to save you before!

176
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:12,819
That was the Kurama Clan...
People from the same clan as me.

177
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:13,989
What?

178
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,097
Why would people
from the same clan as you...?

179
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:25,469
Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei
back to the village?

180
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,276
I'm fine...
I can at least do that myself.

181
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,310
Kiba?!

182
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,377
Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!

183
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,215
Tell us the truth!

184
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:40,390
Isn't this incident and you
quitting our squad...

185
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,358
somehow related?

186
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,064
The Kurama Clan into
which Yakumo was born...

187
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,771
was once a force in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

188
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:00,038
as a family of Genjutsu users.

189
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,811
However, they had been brought
to ruin in recent years,

190
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,076
unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.

191
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:10,952
Then a rising star brimming with
talent appeared in the clan.

192
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:12,318
And that was Yakumo.

193
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,690
My parents and relatives placed
their hopes in me,

194
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,923
the only daughter of
the head family.

195
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:26,767
But I was in poor health and
my official entrance into the Academy

196
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:27,895
was not acknowledged.

197
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,969
I had wanted to live up
to the expectations

198
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,101
of my parents and the clan...

199
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,746
and I got really depressed.

200
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,712
My father saw me like that

201
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,984
and negotiated directly with
the Third Hokage for me.

202
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,053
The Third Hokage whom
Murakumo consulted

203
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,028
realized the high level of
Yakumo's latent power

204
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,925
and decided to leave her
in my custody.

205
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,637
By the order of the Third Hokage,

206
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:06,170
Kurenai Sensei became
my personal teacher.

207
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:08,542
But...

208
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,473
Y Yakumo?!

209
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:18,279
Kurenai Sensei... She!

210
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:53,314
Why?!

211
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:58,691
I don't know.

212
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,790
Maybe since I'm a Genjutsu user too,

213
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,299
I got jealous of the high level
of Yakumo's latent powers.

214
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,500
Jealous...?!

215
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:11,741
Genjutsu practitioners with
higher powers than mine

216
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,003
are not necessary in this village.

217
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:16,778
No way. You'd do that for
a reason like that...?

218
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,871
You understand, don't you?

219
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:21,009
A selfish person like me can't continue
to go on missions

220
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,519
with your lives entrusted to me.

221
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,855
I can't believe that!

222
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:32,193
It's not just her...
I'm a hindrance to the Leaf Village.

223
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,190
Wh What do you mean?

224
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,091
I just can't believe it.

225
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:41,029
Isn't Kurenai Sensei still hiding
something from us...?

226
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:45,169
I also... get that feeling.

227
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,008
Exactly.

228
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,109
It's because...

229
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,714
Kurenai Sensei's hand shook
with heartache

230
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:57,276
when she talked about events
in the past.

231
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:03,088
But the shaking stopped...
when she talked about her motive.

232
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,221
What do you mean?

233
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,129
That motive is a lie.

234
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:11,490
The heart is not affected by
a made up story.

235
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,399
Then her being jealous of Yakumo...

236
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,735
Perhaps she's protecting someone.

237
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,038
Someone so important
Kurenai Sensei would protect?

238
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,344
That would be, for example...

239
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:34,088
I overheard Kurenai Sensei
and the Third Hokage talking.

240
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,668
Yakumo's powers probably
will not awaken for a long while.

241
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,573
I see. But the time will eventually come

242
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:54,338
when the dam bursts and
her powers will pour out.

243
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,677
That power of the Kurama Clan
will eventually threaten

244
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,946
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

245
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:07,314
At that time,
we'll have to eliminate it.

246
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:19,467
Even the Third Hokage was
involved with the sealing of my powers.

247
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,637
The Third Hokage would
never order something like that!

248
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:27,568
My parents died just before

249
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,044
I started training under
Kurenai Sensei.

250
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:33,481
There was a sudden fire.

251
00:20:34,218 --> 00:20:37,949
It seems the fire spread quickly
and they couldn't be saved...

252
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,987
But my parents were even Jonin!

253
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,258
To think they would die
just in a fire.

254
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,559
And a fire in broad daylight
on top of that...

255
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:51,600
And after that, although I was told
there was no foul play...

256
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,429
the autopsy reports were
classified and sealed.

257
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,633
No way?!
It wasn't just an ordinary fire?

258
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,809
My parents were killed on
order of the Third Hokage...!

259
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:15,221
No way...!
No way could that ever be true!

260
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:23,396
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

261
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:29,736
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

262
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:39,546
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

263
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:44,144
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

264
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:49,090
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

265
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,960
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

266
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:58,934
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

267
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:03,166
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

268
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,643
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

269
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:15,049
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

270
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:18,952
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

271
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:24,221
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

272
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:28,355
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

273
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:33,233
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

274
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,930
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

275
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:44,072
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

276
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,348
The story I heard from the girl.

277
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,252
The story I heard from
Kurenai Sensei.

278
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:58,459
Which one is true?
It's unlikely that they're all lying.

279
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,628
But I can say this.

280
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:04,458
There's no way the Third Hokage
would think about eliminating the girl.

281
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:05,927
For the time being,

282
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,937
I've got to get Sensei and
the others to the hospital quick!

283
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:09,768
What's this?!

284
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,133
Next time: "Genjutsu or Reality?"
