1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:03,585
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:06,420
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:12,522
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:28,981
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:34,418
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:37,115
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,626
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:45,153
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,793
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,834
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:07,684
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,848
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:19,662
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:53,122
Say, Grandma Tsunada,
am I really so...?

16
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,869
Come to think of it, recently I feel dull

17
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:01,634
and I make more mistakes
with Jutsu than before.

18
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:03,203
And, what's more, even worse...

19
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,912
I can't eat more than five of
the large size ramen noodles at Ichiraku...

20
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:11,147
Might I perhaps have
some terrible illness?!

21
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:14,651
Come on, and tell me.
I'm prepared to hear the worst!

22
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,281
You are in good health.

23
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:17,218
Huh?

24
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:21,922
Hey! That's Bushy Brow's
medical record, isn't it?

25
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,389
Recently he's been avoiding
his regular check ups.

26
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:25,453
Bring him in, will you?

27
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,495
Huh? But, what about me?

28
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,259
You are stupid. That's all!

29
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,303
Be on your way!

30
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,306
- Put your clothes back on, you idiot!
- Yes!

31
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,399
Unbelievable!

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,841
How was it?

33
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:41,603
I'm fit as a fiddle!

34
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:43,711
I could tell that just by looking at you.

35
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,374
What's that all about?

36
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,419
He doesn't seem to be in
a very good mood, does he?

37
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:51,514
Oh, by the way,
have you seen Bushy Brow?

38
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,354
No, but I know where he is.

39
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,023
These days,
you can always find him here.

40
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,188
Oh...

41
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:04,335
2954... 2955...

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,440
2956... 2957... 2958...

43
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,144
That's just amazing...

44
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:16,144
Even after having surgery
for the kind of injury

45
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,149
that could prevent him from
continuing on as a Ninja...

46
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,114
- Bushy Brow!
- Lee!

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,088
Bushy Brow!

48
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,224
Lee...

49
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,955
It's nothing.

50
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:35,491
Grandma Tsunada told me to bring you
for your regular check up.

51
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:41,230
It slipped my mind.
I've been feeling fine lately, so I just...

52
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,537
You don't look like it though.

53
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:46,873
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL

54
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,684
Rest for a while.

55
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,447
You are forbidden from engaging in
any missions or training for the duration.

56
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,618
There is cumulative damage
to your Chakra Network!

57
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:00,787
You were once injured so badly

58
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,158
that you had to give up on being
a Ninja for a while.

59
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,763
It's my self rule.

60
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,129
Your self rule?

61
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:13,570
Yes! To never forget
my original intentions!

62
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,971
As long as I keep on trying,
I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!

63
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:25,840
All right.

64
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,986
I will remove you from active duty
for a while,

65
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,648
but you may continue training.
Just don't overdo it.

66
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:31,514
Yes!

67
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:34,583
In particular,
I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!

68
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:36,090
Got that?

69
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,629
Y Yes...

70
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,367
Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?

71
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,008
What's wrong? Hey!

72
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,646
The results were bad.

73
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,049
Judging from the way he looked,
I'd say considerably...

74
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,244
By " considerably,
do you mean <i>that</i> considerably?

75
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,549
Yes.
Considerable, to be sure.

76
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:05,421
Considerable?!

77
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,822
What are you so down about?! Lee!

78
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,691
Guy Sensei!

79
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:19,499
I heard the results of the exam.
You have permission to train, don't you?

80
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,267
Yes, but the Hidden Lotus...

81
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:28,774
That day, you were crying right there...

82
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,210
<i>Your surgery will be a success</i>

83
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,779
<i>because you have worked hard</i>
<i>all the way through.</i>

84
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:42,092
<i>You have the power to bring</i>
<i>your own future in the heavens.</i>

85
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:43,827
<i>And in the one in a thousand-</i>

86
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:47,491
<i>no, one in a million chance</i>
<i>that something goes wrong...</i>

87
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,162
<i>I'm going to die with you!</i>

88
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,410
<i>Ever since the time I met you,</i>

89
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:03,005
<i>my Way of Ninja has been</i>
<i>bringing you up to be a fine Ninja.</i>

90
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:05,909
<i>I promise you!</i>

91
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:11,446
You believed me then and had the surgery.
And it was successful.

92
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,719
You must have faith in me
one more time!

93
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:17,187
If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,

94
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,731
then strive to attain an even
greater technique through your efforts!

95
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,893
There are no limits in
the face of your efforts.

96
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,027
Sensei!

97
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,168
You are a genius at effort!

98
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:35,843
Yes, sir!

99
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,676
I'll give you some training for
the first time in quite a spell!

100
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,548
First, dash to the Academy practice hall!

101
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,746
Please instruct me!

102
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:45,313
If you don't get there in ten seconds,
it's 500 push ups!

103
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,186
Right!

104
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:50,757
<i>The Third Super Beast!</i>

105
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,829
It was rash of us to think we could
make it in ten seconds, after all.

106
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,230
Just as well!

107
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:00,766
Five hundred...

108
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,442
It's been a long time since
I smelled this smell...

109
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,165
Who is he?

110
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:37,035
That's Yagura.
He's been here for a week.

111
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:41,112
An acquaintance asked me to determine
whether he has aptitude as a Ninja.

112
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,348
His name is Yagura, you say?

113
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,118
He's pretty good, isn't he?

114
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,618
Yes, he has the instincts for it.

115
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:54,225
He absorbs the things I teach him
like sand absorbs water.

116
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,251
Oh! You're Rock Lee, aren't you?

117
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,490
Y Yes...

118
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,192
I hear that you have superb techniques.

119
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,235
Sensei has told me about you.

120
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,861
No, nothing that great...

121
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:08,132
Don't be bashful, you.

122
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,199
- Master Guy?
- Yes?

123
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:13,478
I would like to receive some instruction
from my senior.

124
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,344
Fine, then. Begin!

125
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:16,039
Huh?!

126
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,409
Guy Sensei!

127
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,452
You came to train, anyway.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,253
First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner
and warm up.

129
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,221
I see...

130
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:29,088
He's a spring chick who has just arrived,
so try not to let him get hurt.

131
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,191
Right.

132
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:33,995
What's Bushy Brow doing in
the Academy practice hall of all places?

133
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,261
I thought his condition was
considerably bad!

134
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,462
Yes, considerably! Considerably!

135
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:40,831
- Huh?!
- Huh?

136
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:46,767
I'm inexperienced,
but please instruct me.

137
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:50,277
Oh, please bear with me, too.

138
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,487
Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both
to give it all you've got

139
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,649
but to also observe
the greatest courtesy.

140
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:05,794
That is friendship!
That is youth. Get ready. Fight!

141
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,129
<i>H He's fast!</i>

142
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,631
Let's have you show me...

143
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:12,671
The depth of the Taijutsu that
Might Guy drilled into you!

144
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,070
<i>What power!</i>

145
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,177
<i>Every single blow is heavy!</i>

146
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:27,612
<i>I haven't the strength to absorb them!</i>

147
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,056
Leaf Hurricane!

148
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,490
<i>Closing off the escape path above</i>
<i>and strike from a low position...</i>

149
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:38,859
<i>However...</i>

150
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:44,659
The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!

151
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,369
Stop! Hold it right there!

152
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,276
Lee! Are you all right?

153
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:56,947
Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!

154
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,043
What was that that just happened?

155
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,314
The Cross Method...

156
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:07,620
Meeting the opponent's kick

157
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,718
and pinning his foot between
the knee and elbow simultaneously -

158
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,786
a "bone crushing daring technique."

159
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:15,194
Where on earth
did you learn that, Yagura!

160
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,598
I didn't intend to do that.

161
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,301
My body just moved
like that involuntarily...

162
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,599
Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?

163
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:28,774
If Lee hadn't been wearing his weights,
his ankle would have been crushed.

164
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:34,207
It was a splendid move.
Well then, let's continue with the practice.

165
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,685
Let's stop here for today.

166
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,855
I'll take you to the hospital to
have them look at it.

167
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,786
No, I'm completely fine, I tell you...

168
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,454
We knew from the health check up

169
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,894
that Bushy Brow's injuries were
considerable to begin with, didn't we?

170
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:45,828
Considerable!

171
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,927
What was considerable?

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,992
I'm telling you,
just considerable, right?!

173
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,598
- Probably considerable...
- Considerable, I tell you!

174
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,732
<i>Even with the weights on, that speed...</i>

175
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,242
What was considerable?!

176
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,585
Fortunately, there's nothing wrong
with the bone.

177
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:08,551
I see.

178
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:17,858
Um... When can I begin training again?

179
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:20,295
Huh? What are you saying

180
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,993
You're going to need complete rest
for a while.

181
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:25,866
It's amazing that your Achilles tendon
remained uninjured, you know...

182
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:34,837
You said considerable, so...

183
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:40,144
I misunderstood it to mean that
he was in a considerable condition.

184
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,616
But...

185
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:44,417
he came out from the examining room
looking very down,

186
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,117
so I just assumed...

187
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,420
To be sure, he seems dispirited.

188
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,590
He was beaten by a trainee
who isn't even enrolled in the Academy.

189
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,930
A trainee? Lee?

190
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:59,434
Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu
for only one week.

191
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:01,666
In any case,
he was incredibly skilled, that...

192
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,504
What's it called...?

193
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:05,644
The Cross Method!

194
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,803
Yes, that!

195
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,473
He's a genius to deploy
that at the instant!

196
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,979
I hope Lee isn't feeling down, though.

197
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,711
If he were the kind of guy to get
downhearted about a thing like that,

198
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,914
Lee would have quit being
a Shinobi a long time ago.

199
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:17,819
- Huh?
- Huh?

200
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,588
When Lee was in the Academy,

201
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,216
he was told that he had neither
the talent for Ninjutsu,

202
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,352
nor any talent for Genjutsu.

203
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,597
Had it been me,
I would have given up long ago.

204
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:31,799
But Lee got to where he is now purely
through effort and persistence.

205
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,802
If he can just heal his injuries,

206
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:36,932
he'll soon outstrip anyone with
natural talent alone.

207
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,940
- That's true.
- Darn right!

208
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,110
But...

209
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,480
I've heard that if you train too hard,

210
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,744
you can wreck your body and
become a decrepit...

211
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,979
Don't say such a thing!
You're talking about Bushy Brow!

212
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,183
I'm only kidding.
Just a slip of the tongue.

213
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:53,417
- Don't even say that in jest!
- Decrepit?

214
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:55,756
I know, I know.

215
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,522
But actually, we are grateful to Lee.

216
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,088
Huh? Grateful?

217
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,067
Yes, grateful.

218
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,603
<i>Okay, today I'm going to teach you</i>
<i>about self rule.</i>

219
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:09,737
<i>Self...</i>

220
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,408
<i>...rule, you say?</i>

221
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,138
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

222
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:15,942
<i>Please teach me! Me! Me!</i>

223
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,175
<i>All right, ready?</i>

224
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,444
<i>To all things there are principles,</i>

225
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:24,888
<i>and to efficiently make use of things</i>
<i>in daily life, human beings have rules.</i>

226
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:28,420
<i>Okay, today I have something good</i>
<i>to give you all.</i>

227
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:31,486
- <i>Something...</i>
<i>...good?</i>

228
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,990
<i>This!</i>

229
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,495
<i>O Oh!</i>

230
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,831
<i>These tights of the type that</i>
<i>I habitually use...!</i>

231
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,803
<i>They have outstanding ventilation</i>
<i>and moisture wicking properties!</i>

232
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:42,432
<i>Developed for ultimate ease of movement,</i>
<i>it's a complete of of super athletic wear!</i>

233
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,999
<i>If you wear them when you're training,</i>
<i>you'll feel the difference immediately!</i>

234
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,237
<i>You won't be able to do without them!</i>

235
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,506
<i>Next thing you know,</i>
<i>you'll be wearing them all the time!</i>

236
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,913
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>
<i>Please, by all means, give me a pair!</i>

237
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,351
Oh, I got a pair of those myself.
They look cool, don't they?

238
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:57,250
Oh... Is that so?

239
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,988
If it weren't for Lee...

240
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,689
<i>This is youth!</i>

241
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,025
<i>This is guts!</i>

242
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,061
<i>This is Harutaro Minami,</i>
<i>spring chicken of the South!</i>

243
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,626
- <i>You got that all wrong!</i>
- <i>You got that all wrong!</i>

244
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,936
I'm really glad that we've had Lee around.

245
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:15,639
Yeah, me too...

246
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:20,438
I'm sure a C rank mission would
feel insufficient for you,

247
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,912
but there's nobody left to ask but you.

248
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:24,646
Leave it to me.

249
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:28,648
Oh, by the way,
there's someone I'd like to take with me...

250
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,249
Yagura!

251
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,158
When my foot heals,
let's train together aga?

252
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:41,592
I feel no need to take lessons from you.

253
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,335
Even ruling out the fact that
you were wearing weight,

254
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:48,237
there seems to be nothing worth
stealing from you...

255
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:49,899
Stealing?

256
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:53,139
After all, skills acquired
purely through effort

257
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,409
make you nothing
but a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.

258
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:57,871
What did you say?!

259
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,850
As proof of that,
even Sensei has given up on you.

260
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,814
That can't be!

261
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,480
Guy Sensei promised me...

262
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:10,317
that his own Way of Ninja was to
turn me into a splendid Ninja, too!

263
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:15,262
Well then, I wonder why he's gone
so far as to ask me

264
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,894
to come on a mission with him
for practical training...

265
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:20,034
Not you, but me!

266
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:21,738
You?

267
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:26,944
Too bad. There's no way effort
can win out over talent.

268
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,340
Wait!

269
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,238
Did Sensei really asked you to?

270
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:39,617
No, it... can't be true...

271
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:52,871
Lady Tsunade!

272
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,072
Wh What is it?

273
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:57,074
Yagura has been injured and
is under protection.

274
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:00,243
What? Guy was with him.
What on earth happened?

275
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:04,446
No! Yagura is said to have been attacked
before reaching Hidden Leaf Village.

276
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:08,047
Then the trainee Yagura
that accompanied Guy is...

277
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,686
A total imposter.

278
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:14,859
Damn it, one nuisance after another...!

279
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,795
So, these three are the ones
that can be mobilized?

280
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:19,862
What shall we do?

281
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:25,035
Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto...

282
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:27,594
these three go after Guy
and the phony Yagura!

283
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:28,469
Right!

284
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,502
Wait!

285
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,642
Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.

286
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,706
If he learns about this,

287
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,509
he's apt to dash out,
even in the shape he's in.

288
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:37,507
Right!

289
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,677
Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei
went this way?

290
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:43,743
Without a doubt!

291
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,312
His destination was
the Land of Mountain Streams.

292
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,823
He must have gone through this forest.

293
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,051
There's another way to go,
cutting through the mountains,

294
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,425
but it's too dangerous.

295
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,731
Yagura, are you with me?

296
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,469
Yes, Guy Sensei!

297
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:00,797
Don't slow down!

298
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,966
Take each step after first taking
the measure of the mountain terrain!

299
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,837
Right!

300
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,772
Lee could run through here blindfolded.

301
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,339
What's wrong? Yagura?

302
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,382
Oh no!

303
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:19,051
Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!

304
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:20,482
Yagura!

305
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,420
He may be a genius,
but he's still a trainee...

306
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,494
I wonder if I expected
too much from him...

307
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:28,054
Yagura!

308
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,331
What? Were you in such a place?

309
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:40,877
Wooden Training Dummies
for kung fu training...

310
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:48,848
Oh my... It takes me back to my youth.

311
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:53,252
I trained with a burning spirit on
the same kinds of Wooden Dummies.

312
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,651
It makes my body to just start
moving uncontrollably.

313
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:02,289
But why are there Wooden Dummies
in such a place?

314
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,960
Who in the world...?

315
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:07,905
<i>And for what purpose?</i>

316
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,481
They move well for dummies.

317
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:26,180
But, after all, they just look
like automated dolls.

318
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,888
They only have one pattern of movement,

319
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,122
and no matter
how many of them there are,

320
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:34,757
their reach only extends for
a diameter of 3.5 meters,

321
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,130
so they cannot attack.

322
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:41,532
What? Mister, you can move?!

323
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,033
What the heck?!

324
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,911
Hey? Can't you see anything yet? Neji!

325
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:57,986
Even using the Byakugan,
I can't find a single footprint.

326
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:00,856
They can't have gotten that far away,
can they?

327
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,028
They wouldn't have used excessively
dangerous mountain paths either...

328
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,959
However they seem to be able to move,

329
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:14,369
they're just stick figures crawling
over the surface of the ground...

330
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,476
Mister, you can jump, too?!

331
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,578
Not just yet!

332
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,506
Wh What a...!

333
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:56,347
Pleasant, high energy training place...!

334
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:09,222
6,985... 6,986... 6,987... 6,988

335
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:14,726
6,989... 6,990... 6,991...

336
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,234
- <i>There is no limit to training.</i>
- 6,992...

337
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:18,894
- <i>Even if I cannot use my legs,</i>
- 6,993...

338
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,870
- <i>my upper half is still in good shape.</i>
- 6,994...

339
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:22,270
- <i>Guy Sensei thinks...</i>
- 6,995...

340
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,501
- <i>my training is inadequate.</i>
- 6,996...

341
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:27,841
- <i>That's why he compared me with Yagura.</i>
- <i>6, 997... 6,996...</i>

342
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:30,746
- <i>to show me that I wasn't doing enough.</i>
- 6,998... 6,999...

343
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:32,813
7,000!

344
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,185
- <i>I have faith in Guy Sensei!</i>
- 7,001... 7,002...

345
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,451
<i>They're moderately powerful, but...</i>

346
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,222
<i>their movements are monotonous.</i>

347
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,564
<i>Or...so I thought...!</i>

348
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:54,802
<i>Shall I say I am outnumbered?</i>
<i>There seems to be no limit to them!</i>

349
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,504
<i>Wh What is this sound?</i>

350
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,084
What?!

351
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,086
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

352
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:46,590
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

353
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:51,095
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

354
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:54,225
<i>Suggestively</i>

355
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:59,032
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

356
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:05,642
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

357
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:12,206
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

358
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:17,244
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

359
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:22,419
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

360
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:53,817
I thought I knew,
but you do have incredible power, after all.

361
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,092
To think you have such
an amazing kick.

362
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,254
Looks like I have to put out
everything in myself.

363
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,595
Then I would put everything
I've got into this too.

364
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,430
Fine! Why don't you come at me
with intent to beat me?!

365
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:05,901
Please forgive me Guy Sensei.

366
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:08,404
But to me, this is the moment...

367
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,007
- to follow through with my own Ninja Way!
- To follow through with my own Ninja Way!

368
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:16,043

Student vs. Sensei"
