My mother and my father have been killed.

38
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,286
Because of my weakness…

39
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,621
… the entire clan has been swept via.

40
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,791
They have been killed one by one.

41
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,136
Merda!

42
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,019

An other hard training, not as soon as waits for me eaten.

44
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,046
Grandfather.

45
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,132
(Konohamaru).

46
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,553
Hey, Konohamaru!

47
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,934
Naruto-onii-chan!!
(it is a friendly way in order to call it brother)

48
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,479
Ah, the lessons of the academy still are not recommenced?

49
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,899
N..No… not still.

50
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,734
The classrooms of the school are collapsed…

51
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,360
… therefore all we are giving one hand to repair them.

52
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,195
Ah.

53
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,616
Naruto-onii-chan, and you?

54
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,034
You are training yourself?

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,827
, enough.

56
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,168
What is?

57
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,753
What watches?

58
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,171
Oh, nothing of that…

59
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,759
Well, ah…

60
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,428
Now what is?

61
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,473
Also you, than hide to me?

62
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,309
Nothing, truly…

63
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,980
They are not at all sad.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,564
Eh?

65
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,151
It is not the moment rattristar.

66
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,907
How many are all working hardly
in order to reconstruct this village.

67
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,576
Konohamaru…

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,872
E' the moment to engage itself until in bottom for the village.

69
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,793
Therefore also you it works hard and
it trains to you hardly…

70
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,505
… otherwise  I will become  Hokage before you.

71
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,840
Huh?Stupido.

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,592
I  will be sure what it will become Hokage.

73
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,179
Also why you must before graduate yourself to the Academy!

74
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,182
Ah, sure…

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,517
What?

76
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,811
Oh, I have found it.

77
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,145
Here, you hold.

78
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,730
A Ramen gratis
from Ichiraku?

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,066
Indeed?

80
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,237
Of it I have an other anchor, therefore this is for you.

81
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,989
Thank you (thanks),
Naruto-onii-chan!!

82
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,366
Hey, Konohamaru-chan!

83
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,325
Buongiorno.

84
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,202
Now I go.

85
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,997
We will work hard today!

86
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:30,998
Yeah!

87
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,959
Today we must fix the blackboard.

88
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,919
Yeah, I have carried the varnish.

89
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,922
Via… not as soon as ended to eat
the ramen from Ichiraku…

90
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,258
… my training will continue!

91
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,064
From that part…

92
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,027
Oh!Ma that one is....

93
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,450
E' a beautiful one po' that they are died.

94
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,703
A lot probably has happened before the examination from chunin.

95
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,538
Then…

96
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,582
… finally I have understood…

97
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,295
… that you are damned Orochimaru!

98
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,343
After to have assassinated Kazekage-sama…

99
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,514
… Orochimaru or Kabuto has taken
sembianze of Kazekage-sama.

100
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,391
We have been imprudent.

101
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,234
That you are damned, Sarutobi!

102
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,862
He is not cos ì  simple.

103
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:49,660
After all your adversary was a Hokage,
considered from all more strongly of the 5 great villages.

104
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,454
But he has gone better of the previewed one.

105
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,499
You have killed two of the five Kage…

106
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,458
Enough…

107
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,547
Enough with these words that play very of comfort…

108
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,341
… or I will kill  to you!

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,597
Naturally it was not in my intentions.

110
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,684
Although we are not resolutions to destroy the village…

111
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,981
… the other objective of this plan…

112
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,482
Uchiha Sasuke.

113
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,695
Now it has on the neck yours I seal.

114
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:31,952
I have sacrificed both the arms and all my techniques…

115
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,586
If only pits be in a position to making my Uchiha Itachi,
we would not have met all these problems.

116
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,464
But it is a dream that will not be able to never come true.>.

117
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,760
… now it is even more powerful than me.

118
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,558
Here why…

119
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,146
I have left that organization.

120
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,534
E' Kakashi…

121
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,662
What will be happening?

122
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,750
Breakfast! Breakfast!

123
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,628
It waits for to me, mine ramen!

124
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,636
Sai already which is the place?

125
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,346
.

126
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,225
Then it will be all easier.

127
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:37,851
We go.

128
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,898
Eccola that arrives!

129
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,026
Well, well… just what I tried!

130
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,403
The village of Konoha is fantastic.

131
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,157
Just of great level!

132
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,035
Still it occupies your time with similar cretinate?

133
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,996
Beh, this is not other that one collection of information.

134
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,501
Mrs. Komura and Koharu-sensei…

135
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,005
What wants from me the Council?

136
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,091
What we want from you?

137
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,302
You know very well, not is need that you says.

138
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,355
What is those makes cos ì  scared…

139
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,692
I have known that the truce with the enemies of the Sand is stipulated.

140
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:32,573
The Village of the Sand has given the guilt
of all how much to Orochimaru.

141
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:38,495
Moreover, they have declared their complete yield to Konoha.

142
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,123
But they are not here in order to speak about this.

143
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,212
Konoha did not have other choice, to accept the excuses for being able
to maintain the reputation of more powerful village.

144
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:48,964
But…

145
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,760
The power and it want to fight of Konoha are reduced to the bone.

146
00:09:54,344 --> 00:10:00,392
In a situation like this, the first priority is
to still avoid that they happen events gets worse.

147
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:05,647
We do not know if and when the enemy villages
they will try to attack us of new.

148
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:12,237
Therefore we have decided to create a emergency council
composed from the best ones ninja of the village…

149
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,867
… in order to decide the line to hold until to when the village
it will not have repurchased its power.

150
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,912
But before this…

151
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:26,460
We have need of a powerful and charismatic leader.

152
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:32,966
We have very many enemies who are in ambush.
Orochimaru is only one of the many.

153
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,596
I do not understand the need of having to tell
all these things just to me.

154
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,849
Beh, hour I must recommence the collection of information…

155
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,393
What does not seem to have understood one…

156
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,272
We have immediate need of a Fifth Hokage.

157
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:52,402
Yesterday, to the reunion with the Daymos of the village of the Fire,
we have decided that you Jiraya…

158
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,905
… the six prechosen one!!

159
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,619
Me dispiace, but they are not just the person adapted.

160
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:07,209
At this point it is all deciding. Who others if not a Sannin, one of the three best ones shinobi than always, would be adapted?

161
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,422
If you want a Sannin, there is n' is an other beyond me!

162
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,552
Forgotten Tsunade.

163
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,475
Although it is true that it could be the just person…

164
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,812
… we do not have the minimal idea of where it can be.

165
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,524
I  will go to try it! Cos ì  not will be more some problem, just?

166
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,192
But…

167
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,865
Rather than to try to convince to act controvoglia, I think to me more intelligent to choose Tsunade for the role of Hokage.

168
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,618
That of thoughts?

169
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,247
It goes well.

170
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:52,004
We will be believed on. But I would want to place side by side, in order to find Tsunade to you, three units of Anbu search more quickly.

171
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,299
You do not preoccupy yourselves. Not  scapperò  via.

172
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,676
Not there is need that someone me controls.

173
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,970
One single what…

174
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,601
There is a boy that I would want to carry with me in the travel.

175
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,271
I have found an egg a lot interesting.

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,109
Strange, nevertheless I was sure…

177
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,362
Dispiace but if it does not find to me the good meal I cannot give the ramen to you.

178
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,447
It waits for.

179
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,657
They are sure to have of still one…

180
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,870
Ah… had been the last one the one which I have given to Konohamaru?

181
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,040
Welcomes!

182
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,339
Not… mine ramen!

183
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,846
Hey, you two.

184
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,099
Seemed one beautiful brace together.

185
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,354
Idiot. We are here in order to only buy of the Dango (balls of rice) for Anko.

186
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,649
Instead you that what you are making here?

187
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:59,363
Beh, I have bought of the Sonae Mono, and have an appointment here…
(Sonae Mono = votivo food for the tombe of the defunct ones)

188
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,615
… with Sasuke.

189
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,787
Eh.. E' rare to see to you to wait for someone…

190
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,331
That food is for the tomba of Obito?

191
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,499
Obito?

192
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,335
Beh, something of the sort.

193
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,677
Kakashi…

194
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,137
Strange E' that you have arrived before me.

195
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,765
Once every a lot.

196
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,609
It does not appeal to the Natto to me (fagioli of soia fermented)
and all the other cakies.

197
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,695
Ah, indeed?

198
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,751
Uffa! It is not possible, is too much strange!

199
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,811
Ehi voi!Non me you seem inhabitants of the village!

200
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,897
What you have come to make here?

201
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,567
We do not look at ourselves from much Asuma-saint, Kurenai-saint time.

202
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:23,906
Inasmuch as you know our names mean that six one shinobi original of Konoha, me mistake?

203
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,834
You… you six…

204
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,680
Without doubt…

205
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,725
Uchiha

206
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,478
Itachi

207
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,400
Itachi, is of yours knowing?

208
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,528
Therefore…

209
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,073
I  will have to introduce also…

210
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,744
Hoshigaki Kisame…

211
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,247
You remember yourselves of this name in future…

212
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,501
Not there will be some future…

213
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,337
Been in order to take one tide of legnate…

214
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,547
Itachi-saint…

215
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,968
It seems that you are not a lot very seen in this village.

216
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,970
I know to you well…

217
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,598
Hoshigaki Kisame, ninja of the secret village of the Fog…

218
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,435
… searched for homicide from the village of the Water…

219
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,897
… suspected to have participated to the revolt in that county.

220
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:44,695
You two are criminal of S Class in the black book of you search to you.

221
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,282
Itachi.

222
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,619
After to have caused that massacre…
How it dares to replace foot in this village?

223
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,538
A six impudent one.

224
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,790
Asuma-Saint, Kurenai-Saint

225
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,710
Fairies feint not to have to me met.

226
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,297
I do not have some intention to kill to you…

227
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,801
How I can be trusted a person who has killed its relatives?

228
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:15,225
To go around itself in under the secretly mentite village empty is an attitude that I find a lot losco.

229
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,686
Which are your intentions?

230
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:27,237
These persons are many annoying… not tasks?

231
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,407
To how much she seems we cannot calmly go itself some from the village…

232
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,662
But she goes to us flat. Your special attack creates much bustle…

233
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,081
At this point it is decided.

234
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,375
This is…

235
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,002
Genjutsu (style of illusory combat)

236
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,721
It is holding to me to attends with the single tip of the sword.

237
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,473
How much force will really possess?

238
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,979
My sword, Samehada (Rough Skin)…

239
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,824
… it is made in order to tranciare, in order not to cut.

240
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,916
Kurenai, six in delay.

241
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:28,901
This is…

242
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,361
… the end!

243
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,246
A Genjutsu of this level does not work on me.

244
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,247
This is…

245
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,416
Genjutsu Gaeschi
(reflected Genjutsu)

246
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,188
Kurenai!

247
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,191
Me it does not seem that you have the time to watch to you around!

248
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,985
Me dispiace for Kurenai-saint you…

249
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,320
But…

250
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,158
But it ends here!

251
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,369
For you two…

252
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,169
What?

253
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,011
Suiton
(Water Release)

254
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,143
Suikodan not jutsu
(Squalo di Acqua)

255
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,067
My same technique?

256
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,153
Then in order which reason devil you have caught up to us?

257
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:59,575
Beh, before I had asked you two to follow them…

258
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,870
But I was being bored…

259
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,621
Kage bushin?

260
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,748
Hatake.

261
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,876
Kakashi.

262
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
You have kicked up a row all this!

263
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,633
Beh…

264
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,847
… I did not want to gratis lose the good meal during the training of the mattino.

265
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,808
… cos ì  I had hidden it within to the Coprifronte.

266
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:31,732
Well, it is all I lie in wait for.
It eats well and it works hard.

267
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:32,399
What?

268
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,986
You will go to still train to you after this eaten, is not true?

269
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,284
Sure, hardly.

270
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,369
Ok… here…

271
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,496

Ah, welcome!

275
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,299
They have come here since they have said to me…

276
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,303
… that it is just true that only eats ramen.

277
