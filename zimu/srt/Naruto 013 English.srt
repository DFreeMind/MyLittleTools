Arrival!

20
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,465
(This fog.....)

21
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,340
Sasuke, Sakura!

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,147
It is arriving!

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,063
(still alive E'.)

24
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:06,313
(And eccolo here.)

25
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:07,861
Master Kakashi…

26
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,545
This is the technique…

27
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,953
… *del fog veil, true?
* justu hiding fog

28
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,372
Me dispiace to have made to you to wait for, Kakashi.

29
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:24,178
And it continues to carry those mocciosi.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,125
It is shaking of new, than painful.

31
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,333
E' because they are excited.

32
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,016
Vai pure, Sasuke.

33
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,106
(I can see them!)

34
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,621
Milimeter? Successful E' to defeat
the cloni of water.

35
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:05,205
This boy has become much fort.

36
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:08,151
You have avails again, Haku.

37
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:11,376
It seems just of s ì.

38
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,418
Eternal damnation!

39
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:33,881
They are completely in delay.

40
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:48,883
Eh, accidents…

41
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:52,943
It seems just that I had reason.

42
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,181
What you want to say?

43
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,122
That one masked…

44
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:57,241
Eh?

45
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,958
Just as we thought.

46
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:04,938
Therefore the fact to be a hunter
ninja was only one super lie?

47
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:08,235
E' clearly that he is a man of Zabuza…

48
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:11,136
… inasmuch as it is to its flank.

49
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:14,599
How much fierezza extension after
what it has made.

50
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,586
To nobody it appeals to that attitude.

51
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,408
Master Kakashi, watches that it is better than you…

52
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,807
Oh..

53
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,947
To fight ò  I with he!

54
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,096
Huh?

55
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,124
Schernendoci with that behavior....

56
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,526
The bastards as it is
those that hatred more.

57
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:33,430
Six fantastic Sasuke-kun!

58
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:35,508
But because Sakura must
to always favour…

59
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,908
… Sasuke in all which says?

60
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,906
An indeed impressive boy.

61
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,867
Even if the cloni of water…

62
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:48,896
… they have only a tenth one
of the force of it originates them…

63
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,212
… to outside make them cos ì  in that way…

64
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:54,576
However we have picked them of surprise.

65
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,230
Hour you go!

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,937
!

67
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,546
What!

68
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:17,082
Secret Justu of Haku: * Makyouhyoushou
* Demonic ice mirrors!

69
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,742
The six daughter of Tazuna?

70
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:34,421
Spiacente, but you must come with we.

71
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,377

75
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,022
Us servants only a hostage.

76
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,658
A hostage!

77
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,856
Then…

78
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,740
… I kill it?

79
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,771
Firm!

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,990
If touched that boy…

81
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,462
… to bite me ò  the language and to kill to me ò!

82
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,856
You want a hostage, not?

83
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,750
Boy, ringrazia your mother!

84
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:51,997

Six not vented to you before?

87
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:59,048
Enough to chiacchiere.
We carry it via.

88
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,487
Me dispiace, Mother.

89
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,786
Me dispiace a lot!

90
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:15,665

… and they are not able of proteggerti!

92
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,231
I do not want to die!

93
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:30,635
I have too much fear!

94
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:34,103

00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:38,665
You cry like an actor in one tragedy!

00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,651
An idiot as you he would have
to only continue to cry!

97
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,721
You, piece of piagnone!

98
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:48,524
Sure it is tired to cry.

99
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:53,461
E' for that it knows what means
to be strong…

100
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,041
… just like your father.

101
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,064
You must protect us ò  that it considers important…

00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:07,132
… with both the arms…

103
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:10,587
… even if you had to die.

104
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,678
Inari.

105
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,899

106
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,505
Able Sar  ? to become stronger?

107
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,613
Papà!

108
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:47,730
Watching this faccino pretty

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,485
From it walks.

110

Firm!

111
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,384
Inari!

112
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,392

00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:08,445

You are zitta and you go to sleep.

118
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:36,026
Remarkable one. It holds head to the fast attacks.

119
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:42,263
Sakura! Proteggi sig the Tazuna
and you remain to me near.

120
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:44,546
Next to that one Sasuke thinks to us.

121
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:55,599
I would prefer not to have to you to kill…

122
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,204
… but you not desisterai, true?

123
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,107
Sciocchezze.

124
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,107
Capisco.

125
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,739
My next attack
he will be too much fast for you.

126
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:12,721
In more I have two advantages respect you.

127
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,623
Two advantages?

128
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:18,139
The first one regards the water on the pavement.

129
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,783
The second is that I hold occupied
one of your hands.

130
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:28,098
Now you will only be able
to defend to you from my attacks.

131
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:32,690
What? With one single hand?

132
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,565
Magical positions with one single hand?

133
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:40,060
I had not never seen it before.

134
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:43,308
Secret Justu:

135
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,627
Flying water pricks!

136
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,180
No intention to kill eh?

137
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,637
It will be true?

138
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,959
Sasuke-kun!

139
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:02,812
I must Remember the training!

140
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:15,315
Rilasciare mine chakra!

141
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,115
Justu of the corporea commutation?

142
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,735
And the woman…

143
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:38,762
Excused the delay.

144
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:46,745
But a hero always arrives
at the last moment.

145
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:48,982
Naruto!

146
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,331
Inari…

147
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:53,690
Optimal job!

148
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,495
Eh?

149
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,336
Thanks to the fact that you have distracted them…

150
00:11:57,336 --> 00:12:00,185
… I have been able to save your mother!

151
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:10,315
Naruto, as you knew that those two
samurai they were coming here?

152
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:14,913
In the forest there was a wild boar
covered of cuts.

153
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:19,816
Moreover there were signs of Katana on the trees…

154
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:22,798
… in house direction yours.

155
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,984
Cos ì  is preoccupied to me.

156
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:27,649
Here like…

157
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,947
Well, well....

158
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:32,287
But it is not one of the Ninja losing
what has engaged Tazuna?

159
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,389
We make it.

160
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,100
!

161
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,829
They are arriving!

162
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:44,575
And tasks that these functions?

163
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,284
Heh, than idiot!

164
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,411
Moccioso!

165
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:08,381
It makes… Fantastic!

166
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,233
There is I have made it!

167
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:17,538
Naruto, seems to you a ninja indeed!

168
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:22,512
Dumb, it they are since the beginning!

169
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,530
I concentrate mine chakra....

170
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,710
… in the feet!

171
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,551
It has been saved!

172
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,989
Six truly slow one.

173
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,918
Now six you....

174
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:04,563
… that you can be only defended
from my attacks.

175
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:23,461
It has exceeded the speed of Haku?

176
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:29,743
It seems that I am benefitted in speed.

177
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:35,826
Not to underrate the single square
because there are of the children.

178
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:41,281
Sasuke is equipped of the village of the leaf.

179
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:46,631
Sakura is the more dazzling of the village.

180
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,555
Eternal damnation!

181
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:53,966
While the other is Naruto…

182
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:57,705
… the more exhibitionist, noisy…

183
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,666
… and hyperactive of the village.

184
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,283
Cooled?

185
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:07,470
Not, I am well.

186
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,137
