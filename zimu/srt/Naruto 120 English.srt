I have taken!

22
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,374
Eternal damnation…

23
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:02,395
But like possible?

24
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,167
I would have had to hurt it seriously
but on he it has not worked

25
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,800
and those its attack…

26
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:15,232
Akamaru, listens to me.

27
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,503
We will use the Gatsuuga in order to stop it.

28
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:24,605
Hour!

29
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,196
Gatsuuga!

30
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:33,867
Kuchiyose not jutsu!

31
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:45,687
It does not go well.

32
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:50,444
I will play  for you a funeral song

33
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,460
This tizio… who is?

34
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,026
What?

35
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,991
Two against two. Perfect E'.

36
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,492
Is not true, Sakon?

37
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,751
If the Four are employing cos ì  a lot

38
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,309
they must it are imbattuti
in of the enemies forts like they

39
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:27,433
or they are losing time uselessly

40
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:36,886
Probably to slow down them it is Jiroubou,
that one always starved.

41
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:39,658
or Kidoumaru, that it always loses
time to giocherellare

42
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,481
But most intelligent, Sakon,
it is also most problematic, right?

43
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,017
It will not be calmed finchè will not have
killed all its adversaries

44
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,427
even if he had the possibility to continue.

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,145
He believes of being the best one in absolute
only why he is more strongly of the group

46
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,121
Strangely,

47
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,222
also Tayuya is not type to surrender.

48
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:07,520
But from when we have sent He,
nothing has been left the case.

49
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,100
Kimimaro.

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,418
It will be gotten rid easy of
all  that  that does not serve me more

51
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,794
Lascerò  not to carry  to you via Sasuke!

52
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,119
To how much it seems is much
trash here around

53
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:40,331
But to the very fine…
it also remains always trash…

54
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,436
in attended of being jetty via.

55
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:45,437
You are zitto!

56
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:48,985
You come.

57
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,107
I destroy to you!

58
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:31,228
This would be the funeral song?

59
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,738
It is controlling them with the melodia of its flauto!

60
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,246
Merda…

61
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,872
I am going away too much from she.

62
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,436
What I make? What I make hour?

63
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,662
It does not go at all well!

64
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,278
Akamaru!

65
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,728
Ooops, qunidi is that one l ì  the true one?

66
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,297
Tarenken!

67
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,100
You hold!

68
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,786
We are siamesi siblings

69
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:56,786
Of usual my Ukon brother rests within me

70
00:06:56,786 --> 00:07:00,505
… but to times in battle
it comes outside for give to me one hand.

71
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:03,878
Therefore is this its innata ability?

72
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:08,255
Ukon  can  extend arms and legs
from every part of my body

73
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,618
and it is in degree is to attack
that to defend

74
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:12,222
Just cos ì!

75
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,530
Tarenkyaku!

76
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:26,416
Three soccer at the same time
they make, true badly?

77
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,704
Well, the next one sar -

78
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:32,982
We do not have time to lose, Sakon.

79
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,784
We will defeat in a moment.

80
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,394
USA level 2

81
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,751
It goes well, goes well.

82
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,689
Mine fratellone he is impaziente

83
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:05,119
That hat mass behind
its head was not feint.>.

84
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:11,761
Once appeared the other boy
its chakra is increased ten times.

85
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,862
E' a battle without hope.
That day…

86
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:23,366
How it would appeal to to you, brother?

87
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,790
In small pezzetti.

88
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:57,715
Well, the moment has arrived of
to show your determination.

89
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,844
I will take care myself  once of you for all.

90
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,250
Very said!

91
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,227
But this is worth also for you!

92
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,436
Tzk, is being gotten annoyed.

93
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:19,763
But I am beginning to understand
as they move.

94
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,408
…  the problem is that they are too much far.

95
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,174
Merda…

96
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,099
this is all which
we are resolutions to make.

97
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:38,640
What?

98
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,516
You say that it is the case to make it?

99
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,529
Not, we cannot Akamaru.

100
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,946
To make it here, without nobody of ours
companions, would be too much dangerous!

101
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,824
You would have to know it, not?

102
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:54,488
If we used that technique, we would have cos ì
little chakra from not being able to us more to move.

103
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:58,784
If we had to fail, moriremo invano.

104
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,364
Akamaru…

105
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,514
In order it makes me to bite from you…

106
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,967
I must have been pessimo landladies.>.

107
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,523
I have understood Akamaru.

108
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:24,529
I will make  as you have said.
E' our only occasion!

109
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:27,616
Garouga!

110
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,890
Akamaru, hour!

111
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,749
What?

112
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:47,904
Not to mistake, Akamaru.

113
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,422
Fagli to see on what there are trains to you!

114
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,936
Dynamic marking!

115
00:10:58,394 --> 00:11:00,166
As it dares to make one schifosa what cos  ì!

116
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,352
With this, we have ended the preparation

117
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,067
Inuzuka Ryuu Jinjuu Combi Henge!

118
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,751
Soutourou!

119
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:33,173
Finally something of interesting,
even if stupid beast is only one

120
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,756
What will succeed to make?

121
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,363
You take this!

122
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,378
It salted?

123
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:47,619
Sakon that you make! To your right!

124
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:48,496
Merda!

125
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,242
Garouga!

126
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,234
Heh, than of tasks of this?

127
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,851
The spin of the Garouga is such that

128
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:19,396
our field of vision is practically zero.

129
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,603
Even if we do not succeed to touch to you
you come equally cut.

130
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:25,491
If a directed attack arrives you,
you end in pieces.

131
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:51,644
Six pushed to you too much beyond.

132
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:52,957
Huge.

133
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:56,274
I was just thinking about
to divide to us in order to fight.

134
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,600
But c-that.>.?

135
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,105
They are uniforms!

136
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:05,927
True E' that if we had been hit
we would have been hurt seriously

137
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,992
But the true show begins hour!

138
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:11,292
Eternal damnation…

139
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:15,664
, I know it, Akamaru.

140
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,159
We can use the Garouga
only an other time.

141
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,460
The next one will be the last one.

142
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,529
And we can kill them both!

143
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,133
Garouga!

144
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,205
We cannot hide!

145
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,354
You I have said, we we do not use the eyes!

146
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:42,977
Why via scoviamo through
your odore and we attack that one!

147
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:49,946
Alpha!

148
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:51,017
Beta!

149
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,866
Kuchiyose!

150
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,978
Rashoumon!

151
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,290
That it forces…

152
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,736
They are resolutions to damage the Rashoumon,

153
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:17,333
the absolute defense of Orochimaru-sama.

154
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,545
But…

155
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,772
Arrived E' the end!

156
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,304
Akamaru!

157
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,730
Akamaru, you have …

158
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,791
… tried to cover to me!

159
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:40,996
Merda!

160
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,005
It has made of new!

161
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,185
Argh! My eyes!

162
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,710
Eternal damnation!

163
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,035
Merda!

164
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,743
This is not simple urine.

165
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:54,136
E' a powerful acid.
The eyes are burning me!

166
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,909
Dov' has gone the other?

167
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,986
Hey…

168
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,098
It tries to me to you?

169
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:08,350
Me of it I occupy. You go
to wash the eyes to you in the river.

170
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:17,171
This is my special ability.

171
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:22,409
Neanche with yours fiuto and your brain
you will be in a position to defeating to me!

172
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,936
Against my abilities not there is escape.

173
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:33,931
Sai that the flow of chakra
it encircles every single organ?

174
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:39,048
E' closely legacy
to the organs and the epiteliali cells.

175
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:42,972
In these cells the proteins reside all

176
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:49,850
that they are taken care to manage
the cycle of life and dead women.

177
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,352
And when within in level 2

178
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:57,555
they are in a position to using the chakra for
to divide and to reconstruct these proteins.

179
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,443
In poor words,

180
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:03,825
I can divide in pieces my body,

181
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:07,294
and to enter in that one of
adversaries in order then to reconstruct to me.

182
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:08,741
Akamaru…

183
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,545
Me dispiace, Akamaru…

184
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,599
Soon we will be of new together.

185
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,911
Every time, in whichever place,
always we have been!

186
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,446
Yeah! Beautiful job, Akamaru.

187
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:35,110
Fortunately those that have fallen in
trap had the parchment of the Earth

188
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,032
At this rate we will be first!

189
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:48,774
Akamaru without warning has been scared.

190
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:54,310
It succeeds to perceive the chakra of the enemies.

191
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,326
But this is before the time
that I see it cos ì  scared.

192
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,751
Those boys who are
fighting laggiù…

193
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,670
… they are not at all normal.

194
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,782
Seventh encounter.

195
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:07,634
Uzumaki Naruto vs. Inuzuka Kiba

196
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:10,880
Hey! That doggie does not have to immischiarsi!

197
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,424
It would be only of impiccio during the crash!

198
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:16,546
That stupid…
Also Akamaru must fight…

199
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,977
Well,

200
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:20,576

207
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,449
Its hair has become red!

208
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:09,355
Here why Akamaru is called
(Aka=rosso)

209
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,386
We go Akamaru!

210

You take the pill of the soldier.

219
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:41,807
Akamaru!

220
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,290
