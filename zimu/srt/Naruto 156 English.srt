1
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:21,714
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:26,524
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:29,156
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,757
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:36,362
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:55,651
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:06,433
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:21,040
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,137
I guess the storm is
going to come soon...

12
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,340
Let's hurry and head back
to the curry shop.

13
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:49,809
Oh my.

14
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:53,808
<i>That thunder right now...</i>

15
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,547
<i>came from the direction</i>
<i>of the Katabami Gold Mine...</i>

16
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,527
<i>Raiga's Counterattack</i>

17
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,228
B Boss.

18
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,908
R-Ranmaru!

19
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,079
Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!

20
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,125
Quit joking around.
I'm not laughing...

21
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,888
Hey... Ranmaru...!

22
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,368
You... What did you do
to Ranmaru?

23
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:50,331
N No! He...

24
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:56,507
When Ranmaru held your hand...

25
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,505
you revived and...

26
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,446
And then... Ranmaru...

27
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,093
Ranmaru...

28
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:32,808
<i>Why is Raiga up?!</i>

29
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,650
<i>I must stop him.</i>

30
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:15,821
Thunder?

31
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:17,021
Could it be?!

32
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,456
You're slow!

33
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:40,844
Are you... that brat's comrade...?

34
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,341
<i>If it's a wooden weapon, then...</i>

35
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:15,444
<i>But I can't hold it over my head...</i>

36
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,840
You're annoying!

37
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,600
You little fly...!

38
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,464
Quit buzzing!

39
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,384
I'm... not smart, you know...

40
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:32,486
Huh?

41
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:39,324
I don't know why this happened...

42
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,400
Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!

43
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:45,938
N -No! That's not true!

44
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,699
Perhaps... the guys from the Leaf...

45
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,138
Oh yeah...
If they didn't come,

46
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:56,480
then Ranmaru and I would
have been together forever...

47
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:58,780
Where are they?!

48
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:02,190
You know, don't you?!
If you don't know, I'll kill you!

49
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,451
I know...

50
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,054
Maybe...!

51
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:18,462
Take me... where they are...

52
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,769
Go!

53
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:20,934
Yes!

54
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:28,816
Hold on, Ranmaru.
For your funeral...

55
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,846
I'll offer up their corpses for you.

56
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:04,851
Ranmaru...

57
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:10,415
This child... Did he give up his life
in order to revive Raiga?

58
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,589
Rai... gan. Rai...

59
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:15,663
Ranmaru! You're alive!

60
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,999
Hang in there! Ranmaru!

61
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,167
Ranmaru!

62
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,373
It started raining.

63
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,310
But we're almost done.

64
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:13,582
Oh my, I'm happy that
you all did this much for me.

65
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:14,723
Oh no!

66
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:19,318
Mom! Something horrible happened!

67
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:22,395
Oh my... What happened, Karashi?

68
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:23,823
Tenten is...!

69
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,458
What happened to Tenten?

70
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,864
She... fell from a cliff and...

71
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:29,834
What?!

72
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,133
What do you mean?!

73
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,908
I was running with her and

74
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:37,510
Tenten said that she would train me
in place of Lee...

75
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,744
But there... when we were
approaching the Lightning Pass,

76
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:43,682
the lightning struck and
a tree came falling and

77
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:48,018
Tenten fell from the Pass
to the bottom of the cliff!

78
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:51,450
Oh my! Then you must go
help her out immediately!

79
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:53,924
Let's go to help, Tenten!

80
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:54,720
Yeah!

81
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,495
Umm... No, I will...

82
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:05,702
I will come after you guys
with the first aid kit.

83
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,340
Okay.

84
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,107
Let's go, Naruto, Lee.

85
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,869
- Yes!
- Right!

86
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:18,613
Oh my, Karashi?

87
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,746
Mom, we're running away
from here.

88
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,154
What are you saying, child?!

89
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,357
Never mind that!

90
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:27,589
I'll explain it later,
so hurry up and get ready.

91
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,192
I will wait at the Lightning Pass.

92
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:36,602
Bring them for sure. If not...

93
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:44,668
I'll offer up you and your mom's corpses
to Ranmaru...

94
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,616
Mom, please!

95
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:49,878
I don't want to!

96
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,517
I'm going to wait
until everybody comes back!

97
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,787
Mom! You are so stubborn!

98
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,253
Just come with me!

99
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,297
Do you think that Tenten would
fall off a cliff

100
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,065
merely because of the thunder?

101
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,963
Huh? What do you mean?

102
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:15,199
That Karashi...
It seems like he wasn't trained enough.

103
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:16,702
I'm sorry...

104
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,444
Then...

105
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,014
Perhaps... it's some kind
of trap again.

106
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,174
Or he's been threatened
by someone...

107
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,346
But the Kurosuki Family is!

108
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,046
Maybe my eyes were cloudy...

109
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,815
No way!

110
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,926
It's him...

111
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,067
He's burning up with fever...

112
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,072
Raigan?

113
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,172
He revived, so you should too...

114
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,884
It's all right. I'm going to die
soon anyway.

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,212
No way! I'm not going to let you say
that you're going to die so easily!

116
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,693
The people who were killed by you
and Raiga died against their will!

117
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,456
I'm not going to let it go your way!

118
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,897
For the sake of those
whose freedoms you took away.

119
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,961
I'm going to have you
take responsibility!

120
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,807
Are you okay?

121
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,044
<i>The storm... It'll be dangerous</i>
<i>to stay here...</i>

122
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,313
<i>To Grandma's place.</i>

123
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,719
You've come!

124
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,226
Raiga!

125
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,959
So he is alive.

126
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,492
This time I'll take you down for sure!

127
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,364
Let's go!

128
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,813
That's not good! Lee!

129
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,417
What are you...?

130
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,061
What is this?

131
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,097
It's in a whole different level
from before...!

132
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:29,599
Probably that attack was
lightning made of Chakra.

133
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,069
But this one...

134
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,808
Real lightning is used as the source...

135
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:41,345
If he can utilize the power of nature,
unlike Chakra, he'll have no limits!

136
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,149
Get down!

137
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,927
Byakugan!

138
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,734
If we dodge through
the electric shock and

139
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,965
take this to a close-range battle...

140
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,237
Naruto!

141
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,133
I know it!

142
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,874
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

143
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,355
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

144
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,968
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

145
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,597
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

146
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,437
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

147
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,476
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

148
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,972
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

149
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,203
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

150
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,577
Good job, Naruto!

151
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,353
Gentle Fist!

152
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,389
Neji!

153
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,770
You brats! Is that all you know?

154
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,002
Unlike the natural thunder power
I'm using,

155
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,341
Chakra has its limits!

156
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,043
Huh?

157
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,479
You're an idiot!
There's an idiot here!

158
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,616
Is that what you say to an opponent
who fought with all his power?!

159
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,853
Huh?

160
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,427
You again...

161
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,365
This time I'm not going to
have a funeral for you!

162
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,915
I am angry.

163
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,424
Oh my, what are you doing?!

164
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,399
Please Mom, come with me!

165
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,797
There's no time.

166
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,134
No, I'm going to stay here!

167
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,935
Oh Tenten!

168
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,678
Oh my! This stupid son of mine!

169
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,780
I couldn't help it,
because the boss came back to life...

170
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,713
If we stay here,
we're going to get killed.

171
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,615
The only choice we have
is to run away!

172
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,453
If you want to run away,
then go.

173
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,626
I'm not running away.

174
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,458
I'm not going to give up,
I will save this child.

175
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,406
I will feed this boy
the curry of life!

176
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,802
Grandma...

177
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,978
It's the curry that revived Lee.

178
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,474
Yes.

179
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,653
If anything happens,
it's not my fault!

180
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,293
You!

181
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,293
One, two...

182
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,360
One, two...

183
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,931
One, two... One, two...

184
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,602
One, two... One, two...

185
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,507
This is bad...

186
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,212
This is really bad!

187
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,095
Eat this... you'll feel better.

188
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,842
Please.

189
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,914
You messed up on
mixing the spices.

190
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,383
Oh my?!

191
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:56,323
Karashi, could you have memorized
my recipe of the curry of life?

192
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,265
Karashi...

193
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,680
This is the true curry of life.

194
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,287
Here, please eat this.

195
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,120
You can't even eat
if you're not with Raiga?

196
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,060
Why...?

197
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,632
Why... for a person like me?

198
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,596
Does one need a reason
to save someone?

199
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,263
To save you,

200
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,332
Grandma Sansho and Karashi
did their best to make the curry.

201
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,736
Don't you feel anything seeing
those two trying their best?

202
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,774
If you don't feel anything,
you're a horrible human being!

203
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,479
Human beings support each other
in order to live...

204
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,921
If there are people who need help,
don't others naturally lend them a hand?

205
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,154
Isn't that being human?

206
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,094
Anyway, one bite is fine.
Why don't you try it?

207
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,951
Was it good?

208
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,785
That is what it feels like to live.

209
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,093
Raigan...

210
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,963
I want him to eat this curry too.

211
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,534
Let's go.

212
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,027
I'm far from finished...!

213
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,802
This guy...
What is up with him?

214
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:41,826
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

215
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:53,404
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

216
00:21:54,146 --> 00:22:04,715
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

217
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:16,900
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

218
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:28,344
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

219
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:39,889
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

220
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:45,653
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

221
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:55,572
Damn it! What in the world
happened to my body?!

222
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,709
It is pitch black in front of me,
my entire body is numb,

223
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,303
and my body doesn't do
what I want it to do.

224
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,910
What is this feeling...?

225
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,881
It's warm, my entire body
is burning,

226
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:13,152
and what is this taste that brings energy
up from the bottom of my stomach...?

227
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,286
