1
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,580
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:26,390
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:29,022
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:31,623
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,228
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:46,146
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:55,517
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,492 --> 00:01:06,299
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:15,775
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:20,906
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:46,367
<i>When Time Stands Still</i>

12
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,469
As long as the score isn't settled,

13
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:54,482
the clock inside my heart will
remain stopped in the past!

14
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,749
Lord Sagi, if you live
for revenge,

15
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:02,450
your heart will sink
into darkness!

16
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:05,025
If it means that I am able
to carry out my revenge...

17
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:08,954
I don't care if my heart sinks
into darkness!

18
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:19,597
<i>That's exactly right.</i>

19
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,177
<i>I hold a grudge against you,</i>
<i>I hate you...</i>

20
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:27,181
<i>My only purpose in living</i>
<i>has been to kill you...</i>

21
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:28,840
<i>Sasuke!</i>

22
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:29,849
<i>I've...</i>

23
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,414
<i>I've survived!</i>

24
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,454
<i>I'm finished with messing around</i>
<i>with you Leaf Village guys.</i>

25
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,389
<i>I will go to Orochimaru!</i>

26
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,100
<i>I can't...let you go there...</i>

27
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,369
I cannot allow...!

28
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,494
You to go there!

29
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,812
I wasn't able to stop a comrade
who was sinking into darkness...

30
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:01,876
However, I won't let you go there,
no matter what!

31
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,075
You pesky little...

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,050
If you get in my way,
I'll consider you an enemy too!

33
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,324
There's no way you guys...
could ever understand!

34
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,692
It's a trick device!

35
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:24,599
No one can hinder my desire!

36
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,470
What was that?!

37
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:34,046
It's no good!

38
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,740
We can't get out!

39
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,212
Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves!

40
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:08,148
Lightning Blade!

41
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,227
There!

42
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,403
How did you figure it out?!

43
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:41,211
Because I've seen your Jutsu
with these very eyes...

44
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:45,119
I remember now...
You are...

45
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,112
Hatake... Kakashi...

46
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,720
The Copy Ninja with
the Sharingan...

47
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,228
Your Jutsu doesn't even faintly mirr
that of Gaara's...

48
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,065
You've only scratched its surface...

49
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,663
All you're doing is leaving
your main body elsewhere

50
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:05,195
and using your Chakra to manipulate
the rocks and sand...

51
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,472
We are nomads...

52
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:11,974
ridiculed as lower ranked Shinobi
without a village...

53
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:18,052
That's why we travel around the country,
stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,715
struggling to one day find our way
into a place in the sun.

55
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,655
But no matter how dedicated
our efforts are...

56
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:29,424
to think there are dimensions
that cannot be transgressed...

57
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,384
That's the direction of
the Feudal Lord's palace...

58
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,887
Hurry up! Lord Sagi's thought
to be buried beneath there!

59
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:13,402
Damn it!
We really got screwed...

60
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:16,541
That jerk!

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,305
What a jerk... Gimme a break!

62
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,042
What happened...

63
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:22,840
Huh?

64
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:24,777
Kakashi Sensei!

65
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:29,887
Sagi totally squashed us just now
and went off somewhere!

66
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,055
Gimme a break...
that guy's some kind of jerk!

67
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,761
Please don't blame him for
the things he has done.

68
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,160
But...!

69
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:40,030
He is himself,
but not himself right now.

70
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,498
Huh? What do you mean?

71
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,600
He is obsessed with avenging

72
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,573
his father and
younger sister's deaths.

73
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:53,170
I believe he is possessed
by the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.

74
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,975
Oh come on... Stop joking...

75
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,245
That's not necessarily a joke.

76
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:04,783
Stop it! That kind of thing gives me
the creeps!

77
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,729
Get a grip! This isn't the time to be
squabbling over things like that!

78
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,454
What's important right now
is to find Sagi!

79
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,432
But we have no idea
where he went.

80
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,401
If he is possessed,

81
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,905
it is certain that
he will return to take revenge...

82
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,739
And moreover... very soon...

83
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,705
<i>Elder Brother...lf I were to lose you too,</i>
<i>after having lost our father...</i>

84
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,585
<i>I could not go on living...</i>

85
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,833
<i>Father...Elder Brother...</i>

86
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,833
<i>I shall join with you...</i>

87
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,492
<i>Elder Brother!</i>

88
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>Elder Brother...</i>
<i>I will avenge this without fail...</i>

89
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:13,687
<i>I will once more restart</i>
<i>the hands of time for you, Elder Brother,</i>

90
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,120
<i>whose time was brought to a standstill...</i>

91
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,683
Until the day that wish is realized...

92
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:47,716
I will live as you, Elder Brother,
as Sagi!

93
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:47,372
<i>Sagi's temperament is such that</i>
<i>he will undoubtedly come here for Moso.</i>

94
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,478
It's actually quite convenient

95
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:30,149
that Lord Sagi comes
all the way here to see me...

96
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,459
Even if I can't get my hands
on Sagi, the Feudal Lord,

97
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,725
it's not a crime to kill him
as the Cursed Warrior.

98
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,832
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

99
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:51,537
What a joke... A ghost appearing
in a child's toy...

100
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,870
You have some nerve appearing here
like this...

101
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,277
Cursed Warrior...

102
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:31,450
<i>Lord Sagi...</i>

103
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:34,353
Huh... who are you?

104
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,014
Aren't you the high and mighty Moso?

105
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,992
I won't answer to words like that

106
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,493
from the likes of a ghost.

107
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,352
Damn you!

108
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:56,567
That's right...

109
00:12:56,644 --> 00:13:00,239
Moso is just a fictitious name
used to deceive the world...

110
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,307
My name is Hoki...

111
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,314
The Leader who heads
the Wandering Ninja...

112
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,087
In place of not having a village,
we the Wandering Ninja

113
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:18,121
steal Jutsu from every village
we pass through and make them our own!

114
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:25,129
But our family has tired of living
for so long as nomads.

115
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:30,310
And we have been searching
for a Land to call our home.

116
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,239
I see...

117
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:33,511
From the very start,

118
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,606
you came here to the Land of Bird
with the intention of taking it over!

119
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,677
There's no way that
somebody like you,

120
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,481
who was born destined to become
a feudal lord...

121
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,250
could understand
the suffering of Wandering Ninja

122
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,917
who do not have a homeland!

123
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,827
I don't see a problem...

124
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:51,093
with the Wandering Ninja
seeking a safe homeland.

125
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,498
After all, your father was someone
who easily trusted others...

126
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,364
He never even suspected anything

127
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,137
when I switched with the monk Moso,
highly reputed for his virtue,

128
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,440
and neared him...

129
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:32,031
He misinterpreted
my Genjutsu of deception

130
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:35,405
as being the holy power
of the virtuous Moso

131
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,103
and put me on the fast track...

132
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:42,571
The only person who suspected me
was Komei.

133
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:48,288
I assassinated Owashi
and drove Komei away...

134
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,353
Y You jerk...
so it was you, after all!

135
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,560
And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.

136
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,360
If I can do that, I will have accomplished
what I set out to do!

137
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,229
You jerk! I won't forgive you!

138
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,163
Revenge for my clan!

139
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,779
You are...?!

140
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,313
Yes, that's right!

141
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,386
My name is Toki!

142
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:23,917
Lady Toki!

143
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,660
I will avenge my father
and brother's death!

144
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,393
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

145
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:35,700
Look at that, Toki...
Our shadows are overlapping, right...

146
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,831
That's the Shadow Possession Jutsu!

147
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,330
With this, you won't be able
to move anymore!

148
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,077
But I wouldn't have imagined that
you would be the younger sister Toki...

149
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:53,320
The Wandering Ninja will be successful
in taking control of this land.

150
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,953
You will die as Sagi just
as you desire!

151
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,085
Lady Toki! Keep your composure!

152
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:03,794
Chishima...

153
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,702
So you were alive, huh...

154
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,432
I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.

155
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,298
Chishima is most ashamed!

156
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,872
Take this and die!

157
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:23,008
I overheard everything just now.

158
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,744
Sagi, I mean, Toki!
Leave the rest to me!

159
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:27,582
Naruto?!

160
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,588
That's not gonna happen!
You will die by your own shadow!

161
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,752
The shadow has nothing to do with it!

162
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:37,095
You're just under the influence
of his Genjutsu!

163
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:40,997
What?!

164
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,466
Lady Toki...

165
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,440
Shadow Possession is
Shikamaru's Clan's Secret Jutsu!

166
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:51,407
There's no way you could
even hope to imitate it!

167
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:55,314
Not only is your identity fake,
but your Ninjutsu is too!

168
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:56,980
Who the hell are you?!

169
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:01,986
Naruto!

170
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,656
The heavens are watching your villainy!

171
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,259
There is no way we will forgive you!

172
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:12,990
Why you Leaf Ninja...
But it's only a Clone Jutsu!

173
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,592
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

174
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,940
They have substances?!

175
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,701
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

176
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:27,442
Sasuke's Phoenix Flower Jutsu
is much more awesome!

177
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,940
It's my turn this time!

178
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,047
Damn you!

179
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,755
Kakashi Hatake...

180
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,660
So you're here too, huh...

181
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:50,229
Hoki, the leader who heads
the Wandering Shinobi... huh...

182
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,030
I've heard rumors about you...

183
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,409
So you're a Shinobi who wanders
from place to place like a bat...

184
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:03,750
Ninja from a rich village can't possibly
imagine circumstances like ours...

185
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,813
Like hell I'll understand it...

186
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,217
The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninja
is to become a Ninja who can endure...

187
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:14,127
People like you who trick people
and wishfully try to seize land

188
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,254
have no right to call themselves Shinobi!

189
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,626
Elitist!

190
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,164
Summoning Jutsu!

191
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,338
Damn! That's a real dragon!

192
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,251
No way!

193
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:50,229
Wait...!

194
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,161
Wait!

195
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:58,829
Over there, huh...

196
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,546
What's up with that?

197
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:17,919
So the Summoning Dragons
were fake too...

198
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,721
He fled off somewhere...

199
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:24,487
Inside the mansion!

200
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,395
I'm not letting him get away!

201
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,645
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

202
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,316
Hey you... wait!

203
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:58,025
Where did he vanish to?!

204
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,859
<i>Hey, Leaf Ninja...</i>

205
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,464
Huh?!

206
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,911
Wh What?!

207
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:15,479
<i>If you want to have Toki back,</i>
<i>come over here...</i>

208
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,208
H How?!

209
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:25,258
<i>Take that boat to come over here...</i>

210
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,291
Genjutsu?

211
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:29,793
<i>Are you scared,</i>
<i>you Leaf apprentice Ninja?</i>

212
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,192
I'm not an apprentice!

213
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:46,610
This place... don't tell me it's...

214
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,350
What's that?

215
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,392
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

216
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:37,193
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

217
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,799
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

218
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,802
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

219
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:46,864
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

220
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,442
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

221
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:52,702
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

222
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,578
<i>The images.</i>

223
00:21:57,652 --> 00:22:01,588
<i>It probably will not end</i>

224
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:07,984
<i>It probably will not end</i>

225
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:12,833
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

226
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,859
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

227
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:18,904
<i>Running freely</i>

228
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:22,534
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

229
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:25,635
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

230
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:28,614
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

231
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:35,219
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

232
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,490
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

233
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,995
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

234
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:52,030
Chishima...

235
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,537
believed in you
until the very end.

236
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:57,673
He truly loved this land...

237
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,937
and he worried about his friends
from the bottom of his heart!

238
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,846
And yet...

239
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,178
And yet...!

240
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,378
I won't forgive you, you bastard!

241
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:10,917
I'm gonna beat the hell outta you!

242
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:14,160

"When Egrets Flap Their Wings"
