2
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:35,143
Let the tenth match... Begin.

3
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:36,939
Go for it!

4
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,132
Fatso!

5
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:48,082
Damn, those two! I'm going to
finish this match quickly and beat them up!

6
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:53,414
Then I'll make it quick without playing around... Fatso.

7
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:58,310
You bandage wrapped sushi-roll!

8
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:03,800
I know your weakness already because we fought you before.

9
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:08,011
You'll release the shock-wave
from the holes on your arm, so...

10
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,304
Ninpou Baika no Jutsu! (multiply-size)

11
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,646
And! Konoha-ryu
Taiketsu! (konoha-style)

12
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,906
I'll be ok as long as he can't attack my ears!

13
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:22,782
Nikudan Sensha! (Human-body Tank)

14
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,142
Poccharikei Banzai! (Hail the Chubby)

15
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:30,858
Alright! Crash him! Choji!

16
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:36,525
That guy's attack can be done without body contact using sound.

17
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,848
But it's only if his oppenent's ears are exposed.

18
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:43,763
His ears are within his body, plus he's wearing ear plugs.

19
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,157
Also, his body is spinning at high speed.

20
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,418
So, how're you going to attack with sound?

21
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:57,725
You can't even move like that. That's what I was waiting for!

22
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,520
That's no use because I'm wearing ear plugs!

23
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,946
No. It's over...

24
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,984
More than 70% of the human body is
made of water which transmits sound.

25
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:25,672
In other words, your entire body is like an ear.

26
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,460
Winner... Dosu Kinuta.

27
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:38,590
Orochimaru-sama... No, Orochimaru!

28
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:44,189
I will show you that I'm not just a tool for testing.

29
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,222
Are you alright?

30
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,710
I want to eat meat.

31
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,290
Oh man. He wasn't even attacked by full power.

32
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:56,050
He lost the match, but I guess I'll
take him for Yakiniku (Korean BBQ).

33
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,388
It's finally done.

34
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,881
Finally the real final exams.

35
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:09,581
Now, all the prelims are done.

36
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:15,568
Shadow Moving in the Darkness Crisis Approaching Sasuke!

37
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,892
I wonder what happened to Naruto...

38
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:31,245
Let's sneak outside now. Iruka-sensei
has his mind somewhere else these days.

39
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:36,087
Konohamaru! Are you trying to cut class again?!

40
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,456
No! Just going to the rest room!

41
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,521
Don't lie!

42
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:50,079
For all of you here, except one that's not here,
who will go to the real exam, congratulations.

43
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,943
I have something I want to ask you...

44
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:01,976
About Sasuke?  Well...

45
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:07,127
I'm sorry to say but even I don't
know much.  Don't worry too much.

46
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,980
Everything is all up to Sasuke himself.

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,606
Sakura, I'm going to leave here now. So,
please listen to the rules for the final exams.

48
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:31,189
Including Uchiha Sasuke who's not
here, there are five from Konoha,

49
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,980
three from Sand,

50
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,781
and one from Sound.

51
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,865
Now I'll explain the rules of the final exam.

52
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,816
It's finally here.

53
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:56,188
I heard that the prelims are done, and
they're going to the final exams.

54
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:04,326
Anyways... this country is so
peaceful... or I should say it only knows the peace.

55
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:10,189
Other countries are busy building up their military power.

56
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,886
Can you take it now?

57
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:21,941
Yeah, I guess I could... but I'm not sure
if it would be fun to take that old-fart's head.

58
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,326
Is that so?

59
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:31,828
It seems to me that you're still hesitating.

60
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,796
From now, the powers of many Ninja villages
will battle for a long time.

61
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,060
The Sound will be one of them.

62
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:42,930
You're trying to trigger it.

63
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:53,240
And he's the bullet for that, right? Uchiha Sasuke right.

64
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:58,884
It's creepy because you're too perceivable.

65
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,992
Not that much.

66
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,929
I didn't know about Dosu, Zaku, and Kin.

67
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:14,690
While gathering information about Sasuke-kun, I did a tactless
thing like recieving their attack to learn their abilities.

68
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:17,623
You overrate me.

69
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:25,654
I see that I am not fully trusted by you yet.

70
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:33,058
Was it really necessary for me to tell you,
my right-arm man, about such low level guys?

71
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,079
That is the proof of my trust.

72
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,574
That's why...

73
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:49,170
...I'll ask you to take care of Sasuke-kun.

74
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:59,139
The cursed seal I gave to him was sealed
by Kakashi. Well, that's nothing actually.

75
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:05,288
I want you to abduct him right now, before
the darkness in his mind disappears.

76
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:09,343
It's not like you to be impatient like that.

77
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,065
There's something I'm worried about...

78
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,682
It's about Uzumaki Naruto, isn't it?

79
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,039
You're so sharp.

80
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:28,985
Sasuke-kun is full of revenge...he has been
living to revenge his big brother, Itachi.

81
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,691
He cannot die until he acheives his goal.

82
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:40,362
But when he fought with me, he came at me even though
he knew he couldn't beat me without fearing death.

83
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,816
I thought he wasn't the type of
kid who lives in hurry for death.

84
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:53,036
According to your information, the relationship with the Kyubi
(nine-tailed) kid has been gradually changing his goal and mind.

85
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,449
Since he has that much of an effect over Sasuke-kun...

86
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:01,684
...it's better to separate those two early.

87
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:07,458
I should dye him in my color soon.

88
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:16,616
Well...

89
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,837
Kabuto, if you...

90
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:23,813
...want to stop me...

91
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:34,982
the only way is for you to kill Sasuke-kun now.

92
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:44,406
You can't kill me because even though you're
stong, you're at the same level as Kakashi.

93
00:09:55,465 --> 00:10:01,130
Just kidding. You can go now. I'm trusting you.

94
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:12,601
His face... I wonder what he's thinking.

95
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:18,095
In the real exam, you'll show your fight in front of everybody.

96
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:24,540
I want each of you to show your ability fully
as a representative of your country.

97
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,836
Therefore, the real exam will take place one month from now.

98
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,630
Aren't we gonna start right now, right here?

99
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:35,436
It's a suitable preparation period.

100
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,459
What do you mean?

101
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:48,490
It's a preparation period to inform of the end of the prelims
and to invite the Daimyo and Shinobi Heads of the other countries.

102
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:54,214
Also, this is a preparation period for you guys.

103
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,339
This old-fart... he always talks in a winding way.

104
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:01,389
I still don't understand. What does that mean?

105
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:06,041
It means that it's a preparation
period to learn your opponent and yourself.

106
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:11,740
It's time to analyze the information you've gathered
during the prelims, and to create tactics for a victory.

107
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:19,678
Fights up till now were against an unknown
enemy, as if you were in the real war.

108
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:25,158
That's true. I never imangined that he uses sand as tool.

109
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:34,206
But the final matches aren't like that. There may be some
of you who've shown everything in front of your rivals.

110
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:41,782
To be fair, during the one month,
each of you should train and work hard.

111
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,398
It's not good if I stay like this. I don't have time
to play around during the month... really... really.

112
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:18,304
Being exceptional isn't always a
good thing. We were too visible.

113
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,956
It was bad luck for both of us to
be caught by Orohimaru-sama's eye.

114
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:27,719
It's surprising that, even at this young
age, he has a demon living inside of him.

115
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:34,415
That's the part will be used, and at the
end with that Ninjutsu, even this kid...

116
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:47,112
Kabuto...prehaps he really may kill Sasuke-kun.

117
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:07,514
That's Kakashi-san, catching my attack in your blind spot...

118
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,393
But the next time, you'd better have at least ten of them.

119
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,217
The Anbu that I prepared were killed this easily.

120
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,043
You're not a regular genin, are you?

121
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:29,677
You're exceptional because you could
prepare your attack as soon as you sensed me.

122
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,273
No, not that good.

123
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:37,659
What business do you have with Sasuke? Based on
what it is... I'll capture and interrogate you.

124
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,633
I don't know if it's possible by somebody like you.

125
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:46,104
Do you want to try that somebody?

126
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:54,235
I believe you're the son of the head medical team in Konoha.

127
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,646
Your name is Yakushi Kabuto, if I remember right.

128
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:02,784
Do you have some connection to Orochimaru?

129
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:10,579
If you catch me here now, you may not be
able to prove my connection to Orochimaru.

130
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,188
Shut up and just answer my question.

131
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,672
What if I say no?

132
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:20,226
I'm the one asking questions here. Answer my question.

133
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:26,824
If you leave me alone now, you'll find it out
eventually. So, can you just let me go this time?

134
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,370
You are a spoiled kid, I see...

135
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,762
Don't mess with an adult too much.

136
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:40,382
Don't talk too big. I have the advantage in this situation.

137
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,677
I see...

138
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,261
Kagebunshin

139
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,380
Shit...I let him get away...

140
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,541
What a guy...

141
00:15:54,948 --> 00:16:00,805
As I thought... this is Shikon No Jutsu, that
controls a dead body by moving its heart temporarily.

142
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:04,308
And he even changed the face of the dead body thoroughly.

143
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:09,351
Plus, he removed the smell of his own body
and stopped the sound of the heart beat,

144
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,777
and pretended to be a dead body of
one of the Anbu that he killed...

145
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,420
for preparing to run away.

146
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:19,615
It's makes sense since he was brought up
as the adopted son of the chief medical Dr.

147
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,655
If a guy like this level is working for Orochimaru...

148
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,977
I can't stay like this...

149
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:33,672
And now, I want to let you all go already, but...

150
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:39,751
before that, there is one important thing
that needs to be done before the final matches.

151
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:44,113
Man, what is it? I need to start training soon!

152
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:50,722
Don't be so impatient. Take one
from the box that Anko is holding.

153
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:53,600
I'll go around, so take your turn.

154
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,191
Only one, ok?

155
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:10,876
Alright. Did everybody take one? Then, tell
me the number on your paper from the left.

156
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,067
It's 8.

157
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,572
Mine is 1.

158
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,467
That means he gets 4.

159
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:31,861
Now, I'll let you know the tournament
brackets of the real exam.

160
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,105
That's what the drawing was for.

161
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,453
Now, Ibiki...show the tournament matching.

162
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:45,176
Naruto vs Neji Gaara vs Sasuke Kankuro vs
Shino Temari vs winner below Dos vs Shikamaru

163
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:49,267
Too far...

164
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,940
The real match is just a tournament?!

165
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:59,130
Besides, I have one more match than anybody else...
and I don't have any intention to get revenge for Choji.

166
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:03,929
Phew...I'm saved since I'm in the different block from Gaara.

167
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:06,116
Uchiha Sasuke

168
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:07,886
That's perfect.

169
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:15,385
Hyuga Neji... from the start? I prefer that!

170
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,382
Sasuke-kun is going against that guy?

171
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:25,680
Can I ask one thing?

172
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:31,461
There will be only one winner because it's a tournament.

173
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,981
Does that mean there's only one who can become Chunin?

174
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:38,317
No, that's not true.

175
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:49,366
The Judges, including me, Kazekage, Daimyo, and Shinobi Heads from
each country that request missions, will watch the final matches.

176
00:18:49,824 --> 00:19:00,928
Those judges will grade you throughout the tournament. For
those who are judged to have enough quality to be Chunin,

177
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:06,014
even if you lose in the first
match, it is still possible to be Chunin.

178
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:11,151
That means, it is possible that everybody
here will become Chunin?

179
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,071
Well...on the other hand, it is also
possible that nobody can become Chunin.

180
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:24,127
To win through the tournament means that you will
get more rounds to appeal your ability to the judges.

181
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,229
Did you understand, Shikamaru-kun?

182
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,425
Damnit... it's so troublesome...

183
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,190
Good job till now. Dismissed until one month later.

184
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:43,339
My second round would be either no-eyebrow from Sand or Sasuke.
That guy is strong enough to beat up Geji-Mayu (Thick-Eyebrows).

185
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,097
Sabaky-Kyu! (Desert Coffin)

186
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,147
I want to fight against you, too.

187
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:03,174
Hmmm... I will ask Kakashi-sensei...

188
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:07,102
Hey, where's Sasuke's room?

189
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,543
Nobody is allowed to see Sasuke-sama.

190
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,122
Wh..why is that?

191
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,598
I cannot tell you...

192
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,118
Hey, lady. Why?

193
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,949
Naruto, be quiet in the hospital.

194
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,261
Kakashi-sensei!

195
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,791
Hey, hey... I have a favor to ask...

196
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,689
You don't need to tell me the end of your sentence.

197
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:28,024
I guessed that you'll come to me like that...

198
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:31,318
I appointed a person who can oversee your training.

199
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,912
Whhhhy? I want Kakashi-sensei to train me!!

200
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,967
I have a little business to take care
of. So, I don't have time to spend on you.

201
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,820
You're going to train Sasuke, aren't you?!

202
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,549
Well... don't say it like that.

203
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:53,314
I found a more reliable teacher than me for you.

204
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,937
Who is it?

205
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,901
It's me!

206
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:02,664
Ahhhhhhhh! You're the closet-pervert!!

207
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,156
How dare you.

208
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:41,776
Man, I can't understand. I don't
care if he's an elite teacher or what.

209
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,881
But I don't believe I can get any stronger by getting
trained by a closet-pervert who's weaker than me!

210
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:49,518
I've got to be stronger no matter what!

211
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:55,205
If you really are a great Ninja, then
make me understood by your power.

212
00:22:55,199 --> 00:23:00,199
Next Episode. Ebisu Again! I won't
let you do such perveted things!

213
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,919
I will win the next battle, too.
