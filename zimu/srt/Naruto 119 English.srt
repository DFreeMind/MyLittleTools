I will let out  you  here.

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,130
Moreover  esaudirò  also an other desire.

Not preoccuparti. This your strong will
it will continue to survive within of me.

All it will not go lost.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,630
Then I take your body.

25
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,650
For some years it will have a body

26
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,550
in which the resurrezione will not work.

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,680
But there will be an other occasion.

28
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,040
Effectively…

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
… I am not worth null like container
for the technique of the resurrezione.

30
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,400
Having lost all…

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,050
… it was difficult to find the scope to me of my life.

32
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,980
Hour  but  they are successful finally
to understand which it is.

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,130
Even if  I will not make  from container

34
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,440
I  will be to carry that new one here.

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,540
Also to cost of living....

36
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:12,000
E' my thanks for
my getlteman, Orochimaru-sama.

37
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,340
E' the last thing that  can  make a useless being like me.

38
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,690
Episode #119
A serious error! A new enemy!

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,260
They are fast!

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,010
Akamaru!

41
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,660
Idiot, you come as soon as you have made.

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,960
Oh not!

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,000
Perfect.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,030
Ce we have made it!

45
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,950
Akamaru! Optimal job!

46
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,130
You stop it to turn to me around!

47
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,900
Akamaru!

48
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,530
You stop it of piagnucolare, six dead bastard!

49
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,680
I will kill  to you!

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,450
It waits for to me!

51
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,240
Kiba!

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,790
Akamaru!

53
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,400
Eternal damnation.>.

54
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,030
Cos' has happened?

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,490
Idiots!

56
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,250
Where are ended Kiba and Akamaru?

57
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,170
It is selling also the other.

58
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,170
It cannot  be helped.

59
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,950
I  will fight  us.
You you take the barrel and you go ahead.

60
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,010
Shikamaru.>.

61
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,880
Sbrigati, you go!

62
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,250
Why six.>.?

63
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,980
Me spiace, Naruto…

64
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,070
I suppose to have made the calculations badly.

65
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,840
Kimimaro.

66
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,540
Six in delay, Tayuya.

67
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,190
And then, cos' it is happened to the others three?

68
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,400
You, once you made part of the five

69
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Because six…

70
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,130
Your body.>.

71
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,850
Your body is not more.>.

72
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,300
I do not move more using my body.

73
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,300
I move with the force of my spirit.

74
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,550
Fool.>.

75
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,630
You are living more of the due.>.

76
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,090
I am beginning to understand.

77
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,300
The feeling that test existing itself with the single mind
without the constriction of the body.

78
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,980
E' like if same touching a part
of the dreams of Orochimaru-sama.

79
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,110
Orochimaru!

80
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,190
This container is essential for those dreams.

81
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,890
The body that Orochimaru wishes truly.

82
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,330
But you boys were a po' in delay.

83
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,330
Arrived E' an other dangerous enemy.

84
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,340
This feeling… Whichever is not one.

85
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,470
In any case, I must study the situation.

86
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,050
If we distracted ourselves
and we attacked without to think

87
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,400
Because!

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,680
About what devil you are speaking?

89
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,270
Naruto!

90
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,110
They give Sasuke behind to us!

91
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,550
It waits for!

92
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,500
Tayuya.>.

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,910
The reason for which I still do not have victim of a murder to you,

94
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,490
it is why you must survive in order to complete one mission.

95
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,880
And my mission,

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,500
it is to carry that one to Orochimaru-sama.

97
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,510
It is not too much late?

98
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,980
You I have said.

99
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,780
That one is the body that Orochimaru-sama
it wishes truly.

100
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,500
You want to say that it will be the next container?

101
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,010
Exactly.

102
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,600
And this is the maximum that I can make.

103
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,860
Those average cartridges, I leave them you.

104
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,210
Sasuke…

105
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,860
That bastard!

106
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,170
It calm Naruto To You.

107
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,000
As I can be calmed!

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,340
In this way,
Sasuke will be to outside of our capacity!

109
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,730
What Naruto says is true.

110
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,290
This is one mission in order to bring back Sasuke to Konoha.

111
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,740
For the resolution of this mission,
I must think next to the better strategy to take.

112
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,560
It shocks!

113
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,260
I will kill  to you  endured!

114
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,310
Naruto, listens.

115
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,840
It makes as I say to you.

116
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,700
Kage Bunshin is its single dangerous movement,
a typical combat body to body from idiots.

117
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,740
And it is a mediocre utilizzatore
of the techniques of the shadow.

118
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,470
I suppose is rather an acute and shrewed head.

119
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,940
Understood?

120
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,130
We go, losing!

121
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,080
We are two against one.

122
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,610
We exceed in number!

123
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,080
If there are two of we, we can make it us!

124
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,460
We go, Naruto!

125
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,860
We begin!

126
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,670
Stupid pieces of merda! It does not import how many you are
it will not make some difference.

127
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,300
Not to underrate our job of square.

128
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,400
We go!

129
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,100
Force!

130
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,670
Hour, Naruto!

131
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,100
I will take  to you  to soccer in seating!

132
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,450
Completed mission.

133
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,140
Goodbye!

134
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,530
Eternal damnation, you have brailed up to me!

135
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,060
Job of square! Idiot!

136
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,040
Eternal damnation.

137
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,970
I imagine you would not fall
in the same technique an other time, eh?

138
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,330
Marmocchio!

139
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,630
Beh, I imagine that to leave it to go via
good idea has been one!

140
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,500
It remembers.>.

141
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,450
.. the techniques are not the single way in order to fight.

142
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,250
I leave you, Shikamaru.

143
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,390
Arrival, Sasuke!

144
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,030
It succeeded to move
truly well with that body.

145
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,930
Kabuto.>.

146
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,750
I do not know what you you have asked to make to it,

147
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,190
but he seems cruel.

148
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,870
It is not like seems,

149
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,430
I have not given some order to it.

150
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,170
It does not appeal to to me to force
the persons to make the things.

151
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,620
It has made of its spontaneous will.

152
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,610
Only for you, the solo that he esteem.

153
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,610
Kabuto,

154
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,140
you have one sure twisted personality.

155
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,480
Orochimaru-sama, for you, Kimimaro was a perfect being.

156
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,750
Its ideas were spotted with the dusk
like yours.

157
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,580
It has idolizzato to you.

158
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,140
It adored to you and it admired to you like a fanatic.

159
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,590
For more, it was one shinobi coming from from the clan
that it possessed the bodies nearer the perfection.

160
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,540
and their abilities have inherit all.

161
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,710
Cos ì, he exists for being…

162
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,490
S ì.>.

163
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,370
the single thought to lose it
it makes me to rabbrividire.

164
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,540
Task still to the man

165
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,490
that my spirit has truly wished.

166
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,660
The body that more I wanted,

167
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,970
Kimimaro…

168
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:17,890
And if it had not been infected from that disease,
the murder of the Hokage would have been completed.

169
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,510
I seal!

170
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,530
My arms.>.

171
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,330
You will not be more in a position to using your arms.

172
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,910
Hour that both your arms are unusable,
you will not be more in a position to completing seals.

173
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,570
I have taken your Ninjutsu!

174
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,600
You that you would want to destroy Konoha, have lost!

175
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,840
Orochimaru, six one foolish…

176
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,200
That sin, we will not be able to die together

177
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,380
.. my student.

178
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,870
We see again the other world.

179
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,910
Sasuke.>.

180
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,040
Still it has not arrived?

181
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,210
It would want not to have last all those suffering?

182
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,130
In this world, it seems that not always the things
they go like presupposed.

183
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,630
E' only one time issue,

184
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,860
Orochimaru-sama.

185
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,340
If Tayuya will make return,

186
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,450
I will kill.

187
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,530
It waits for!

188
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,080
Hey!

189
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,210
We see, as I would have to defeat it?

190
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,240
You.>.

191
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,710
Those eyes.>.

192
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,690
It seems has one strange chakra.

193
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,440
What has intention to make Orochimaru!

194
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,070
Why it wants Sasuke!

195
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Orochimaru-sama has already perfected
the technique of immortality.

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,080
To acquire all the techniques,

197
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,400
it demands much time.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,950
What must make us with Sasuke!

199
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,000
Although he is immortale,
its body  cannot  last in eternal.

200
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:45,290
Before that the body is decomposed,

201
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,060
new and a more strong body is maintained within a container of spirits.

202
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,360
And that body e' Sasuke!

203
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,900
Exactly.

204
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,100
Like if.>.

205
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,860
.. you left to happen!

206
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,870
Fool.

207
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,320
Insignificant small man, cos' you have intention to make?

208
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,210
And then, it watches cos' is happened.

209
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,370
Every time, in order to go ahead
you have sacrificed one of your members.

210
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,150
Sasuke..quel boy is cos ì  precious for you?

211
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,380
For one single person,
how many members of your square you will lose?

212
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,030
A six worm.

213
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,200
It could be true.

214
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,310
This is my first mission
like squad leader.

215
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,030
Obviously they are preoccupied, seeing like the number
of my companions of square it has decreased.

216
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,490
I do not know neanche if my actions
they are corrected or less.

217
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,380
And I know of accounting for their screw.

218
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,760
And they are more than preoccupied for the kidnapped boy.
I would have to think next to the other four.

219
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,890
To interrupt the mission would have been second the rules.

220
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,730
Then because you have not made it?

221
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,100
In this world,
all it does not work as a game of the scappa via.>.

222
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,280
After all, we are not the type of persons,

223
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,030
that they would abandon one kidnapped person,

224
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,230
for our single salvation.

225
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,810
Included me.

226
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,520
For the exactitude, they are a lazy one that it loves to watch clouds.

227
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,460
They are not the type of person who says to the other thing to make.

228
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,170
The only thing that I can make for they is…

229
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,270
… to believe in they.

230
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,700
It listens,

231
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,610
I have not never thought to sacrifice them.

232
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,730
Neanche I have not thought that they are died.

233
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,040
I have not never underrated my companions of square.

234
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,340
Found!

235
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,540
Kuchiyose not Jutsu!

236
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,160
It does not go well.

237
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,520
I will play  you  a funeral song.

238
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,570
You would not have to underrate us, bastard!

239
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,360
I will succeed  to carry to me via Sasuke

240
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,150
Interesting.

241
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,270

242
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,610
