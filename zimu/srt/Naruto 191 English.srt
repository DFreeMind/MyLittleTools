1
00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:03,651
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:06,486
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:12,589
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:29,047
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:34,484
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:37,181
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:40,692
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,219
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:51,859
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:56,900
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,976 --> 00:01:02,346
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:07,750
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,914
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:19,728
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,456
I won't count on you.

16
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,628
I will go by myself.

17
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:54,328
Wait.
I'll go too.

18
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,737
I promised Hinata that I would definitely
protect you, Princess!

19
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,676
With Hinata...?

20
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,938
She fought with the second Janin
and got hurt badly...

21
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,082
Hinata did?

22
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:17,714
You guys said that you didn't accept
the mission of protecting me.

23
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,417
Then why do you concern
yourselves with me...?

24
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,490
I...

25
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:25,455
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.

26
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,900
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad... That's all.

27
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,096
Well, let's go!

28
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,831
If we pass through
the valley ahead of us,

29
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,137
we'll get to the town.

30
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:39,275
If we do that,

31
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,812
they probably won't chase us
all the way there!

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,785
Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!

33
00:02:56,462 --> 00:03:00,057
Too bad, but you guys won't
be able to reach that village.

34
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,197
Since you guys are going
to die here!

35
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,163
Wh Why is he floating in the air?

36
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:13,811
Hey kid, I bet a low class Ninja like you
can't even imagine my Jutsu.

37
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,345
Take this!

38
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:23,849
Naruto!

39
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,623
I'm okay.

40
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:30,653
But what just flew at me?

41
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,493
Don't waste your time fighting me.

42
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,159
I have already captured
all three of your friends.

43
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:38,193
What?

44
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:41,229
Just hand over the girl.

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,575
If you do that I'll spare your friends.

46
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,205
Choji and Hinata...

47
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,041
So, what are you going to do kid?

48
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:56,213
Naruto... Are you going to
abandon me too?

49
00:03:56,555 --> 00:04:00,582
Oh no, this princess is
telling you to save her,

50
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,524
and let your friends die.

51
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:07,955
Well, I don't mind that kind of thinking
since it's the same as mine.

52
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,601
Same as yours?

53
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,165
That's right.

54
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:13,936
If someone is useful,

55
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,064
then you should make use
of them

56
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,266
even though they may be
your siblings.

57
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,377
There is one thing I need
to thank you guys for.

58
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:21,970
Thank us?
For what?!

59
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,642
For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.

60
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,913
I was going to put an end to them myself
sooner or later anyways.

61
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,485
What...?!

62
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:33,887
It was clear that they would
soon tell me,

63
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,019
"Big Brother, give us the property
and the money too.

64
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,359
Three feudal lords are not necessary
in one country.

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,132
And you still call
yourselves brothers?!

66
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,067
It doesn't matter.

67
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:47,996
Even though it's my parents
or my brothers.

68
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,233
I'll make use of anything I can.

69
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,772
Now, give her to me.

70
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,213
I refuse.

71
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:58,983
I see.

72
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:00,246
Naruto...

73
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,244
A person who would abandon
his siblings

74
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,553
would never keep his promise
with me.

75
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,556
Well, that's true.

76
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,327
It's impossible, Naruto!

77
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,229
You don't even know
what kind of Jutsu it is!

78
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:17,993
That doesn't matter!

79
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,735
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

80
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,616
Take this!

81
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,583
<i>What is this guy?</i>

82
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:43,359
<i>There's something hard around</i>
<i>his body that I can't see...</i>

83
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,128
Naruto!

84
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:54,937
I'm sorry, but none of
your Ninjutsu work on me.

85
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:56,335
Not even one.

86
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,002
Damn it!

87
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:10,950
What?!

88
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,786
What is that?

89
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,594
Crystallized ice...?

90
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,865
I can gather water vapor in the air

91
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:26,336
and instantly turn it
into crystallized ice.

92
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:30,842
So the things that just attacked me
were ice Shuriken.

93
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,905
Man! It's hard to see
if it's transparent ice.

94
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,071
Just that is not too interesting.

95
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,081
<i>What is this great sense</i>
<i>of danger?</i>

96
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:47,956
<i>I'm sure his Jutsu has already started!</i>

97
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:50,251
<i>Where is it, where is it</i>
<i>coming from?!</i>

98
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,294
Kid, do you know
today's weather forecast?

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,189
Weather forecast?

100
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:58,060
Cloudy and partly sunny.

101
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,669
It's a good weather for you to die.

102
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:10,675
What is this?

103
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:21,690
What?!

104
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:23,856
Look out!

105
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,212
Damn it!

106
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:44,106
Naruto!

107
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,239
That's a lens!

108
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,245
Lens?!

109
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:52,320
Yup, I turned the crystallized ice
into lens

110
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:53,949
to gather the sunlight and shoot it.

111
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,390
So, I can't really control it,
but it'll be an instant when you die.

112
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:02,626
As soon as the battle condition
at the Land of Green is prepared,

113
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:06,228
I'll burn up the surrounding countries
with this Jutsu.

114
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,475
This way!

115
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:26,786
It's no use.

116
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,693
I could even see things that are
a thousand miles away.

117
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,584
I found you.

118
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:29,279
Naruto... Why do you protect me?

119
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:31,951
I wonder why...

120
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,448
I don't know either.

121
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,818
Naruto...

122
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:01,877
Haruna!

123
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:06,882
While I distract him, run!

124
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,569
Don't even think you guys
could get away from my Jutsu

125
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:20,570
by doing that!

126
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,355
You decided to hand me
over the princess?

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,696
Who would hand over Haruna
to the likes of you!

128
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,496
What a fool.

129
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,968
I'm telling you that if you hand me
the selfish princess

130
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,807
and just go back to the village,
I'll let your friends go.

131
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:04,544
I promised with Hinata that
I will save Haruna!

132
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,075
Just to keep a promise
with your friend,

133
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:11,145
you're gonna risk your life to fight
in a hopeless battle, huh...?

134
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,625
You're just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.

135
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:20,358
A good natured big fool!

136
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,067
<i>Same as my father...?!</i>

137
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:32,202
You're just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.

138
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,370
A good natured big fool!

139
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,847
<i>Same as my father...?!</i>

140
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:41,007
This is what the feudal lord
foolishly said

141
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,714
to us who were trying to take over
the Land of Green:

142
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,820
"Please do not torment the people
in this country."

143
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,283
<i>I beg you!</i>

144
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:52,262
<i>I don't care what happens to me,</i>

145
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,161
<i>but please promise me one thing!</i>

146
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,960
<i>This is a small weak country</i>
<i>surrounded by big countries.</i>

147
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:01,130
<i>Without the powers of the people,</i>
<i>the country cannot prosper!</i>

148
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,168
<i>In order for the country to prosper,</i>

149
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,402
<i>we must take care of</i>
<i>each individual people</i>

150
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,173
<i>and not sacrifice a single life!</i>

151
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,343
<i>I want you to consider the people</i>
<i>as a family</i>

152
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:12,508
<i>and not torment them.</i>

153
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,477
I am the feudal lord!

154
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:18,181
It doesn't matter what I do
to the people, right?

155
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,385
That's why...

156
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:26,119
That's why this country has
been at peace until now!

157
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,392
Peace doesn't matter to me.

158
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,701
All I need to do is use the people
as the stepping stones

159
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,202
and feather my nest!

160
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,465
And because of that kind
of good nature,

161
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,632
his daughter was taken
as a hostage!

162
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,438
What do you mean?!

163
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,973
It seems like it was ten years ago.

164
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:48,847
<i>A lot of the people were sacrificed</i>
<i>by the pressure of the big country...</i>

165
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:54,183
<i>Riots occurred in the country</i>
<i>and the country came close to corruption.</i>

166
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,683
<i>It was a bitter decision...</i>

167
00:12:57,996 --> 00:13:00,294
<i>I had no choice but to let</i>
<i>my daughter,</i>

168
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,799
<i>who is more important than my life,</i>
<i>taken as a hostage.</i>

169
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:06,103
<i>I know that Haruna will</i>
<i>not forgive me...</i>

170
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,769
<i>A cold hearted father who sacrificed</i>
<i>his own daughter</i>

171
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:15,677
<i>just for the peace of the country.</i>

172
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:21,482
<i>Why don't you ask</i>
<i>your daughter directly?!</i>

173
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:23,318
<i>In the after life!</i>

174
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:28,487
<i>My father was...killed!</i>

175
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,387
What an outrageously
good natured person, huh?

176
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,828
You're wrong,
he was a great feudal lord!

177
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:37,827
Naruto...

178
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:39,935
Listen!

179
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,463
There are two kinds of human beings
in this world.

180
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,668
Those who use others,
and those who get used!

181
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:49,604
In my case, I will get to
the top using anyone,

182
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,615
whether it's my parents or my friends.

183
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,614
You! I'll never forgive you!

184
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:55,820
Shut up!

185
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,697
D-Damn!

186
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,599
Die!

187
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:29,883
<i>Naruto...</i>

188
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,580
You can't move anymore?!

189
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,426
You're not the one...

190
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:45,096
It was because of Haruna's father
that this country was peaceful...

191
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:50,704
The person who is going
to succeed this country is...

192
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:55,505
The person is...

193
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,976
Haruna!

194
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,682
Stop!

195
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:04,516
Stupid!

196
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,147
Why aren't you running away?!

197
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:11,288
Kill me! If you kill me,
your goal will be fulfilled, right?!

198
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:14,061
Naruto, Naruto has nothing
to do with this!

199
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:17,935
So both the parent and daughter
are nave, after all.

200
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:20,731
Why not complain to your father
in the afterlife

201
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:23,239
for making you sacrifice your life
for the country?

202
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,375
How scary...

203
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:30,978
Y You!

204
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,747
It's time for you to die, kid.

205
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:39,316
I'm not a kid!

206
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,521
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

207
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:43,990
I'm not going to hand over
the Land of Green

208
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,997
to a person like you!

209
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:49,528
Naruto!

210
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,237
Die!

211
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:02,972
What?!

212
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,793
No... way...

213
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:25,669
But kid, it's too late even
though you took me down...

214
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,834
The Land of Green without
a feudal lord will collapse

215
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:31,375
due to the war between
the large countries over its territory.

216
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,640
It's too bad,
but that's not gonna happen!

217
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,775
Shizune!

218
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,884
It's a pain,
but we came to get you guys!

219
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,184
Shikamaru!

220
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:46,252
But... I didn't ask you guys
to come get us!

221
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:50,055
But you look pretty beaten up.

222
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,354
No no, this is...

223
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,192
Naruto!

224
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,197
Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!

225
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,394
Everyone was safe!

226
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:00,427
Yeah.

227
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,900
We were rescued by
the people of Leaf Village.

228
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:07,941
Huh? Oh yeah,
why are you guys here?

229
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,814
We received notice of a coup
in the Land of Green

230
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:13,316
and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me
to come...

231
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:18,681
Princess Haruna's father was
very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.

232
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,281
My father...?

233
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:25,823
Please forgive us, when we arrived,
your father was already...

234
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:29,533
I see... I've caused
so much trouble for you.

235
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,265
Damn!

236
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,064
The position of the feudal lord
that I finally got a hold of...

237
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:37,899
But, then the surrounding countries
are not going to stay quiet.

238
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:39,535
It's okay.

239
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,845
An announcement has been sent out
to the neighboring countries

240
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,108
in the name of the next feudal lord.

241
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,809
Under your name, Princess Haruna.

242
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:49,920
Then we don't need to worry about
the country getting attacked anymore!

243
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:50,778
Haruna!

244
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:55,855
Haruna...

245
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:02,592
Do it.

246
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,092
You want to take revenge
with your own hands, right?

247
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,265
I'll do the same if I were you.

248
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,888
I am... not like you!

249
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,667
Haruna...

250
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:05,495
Kikunojou, please forgive me.

251
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:07,426
Princess Haruna.

252
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,932
Here, Kikunojou could look over
the Land of Green.

253
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:14,403
I'm sure that Kikunojou
will watch over everyone forever.

254
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,303
Well, Lady Haruna,
we are leaving now.

255
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:24,012
Thank you, Naruto, Choji,
and Hinata.

256
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,109
Shizune, I'd like to ask a special favor.

257
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,144
What is it, Princess Haruna?

258
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:35,158
My role is to take over my father's will
to protect the peace of Land of Green.

259
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:36,785
In order to do that,

260
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,795
I want to borrow some help
from the Leaf Village.

261
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,059
Our help?

262
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,156
Yes.

263
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,729
I want you to lend me Naruto.

264
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:44,457
Huh?!

265
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,032
Please, Naruto.

266
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:49,505
Princess Haruna.

267
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,577
I want you to help me
with the revival of the Land of Green.

268
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:05,521
I... I...

269
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:12,154
I'm sorry,
but I can't really do that.

270
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:17,997
I need to go back to my friends.

271
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:21,371
And I need to do more training
and become much stronger.

272
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,665
There are things that I must do.

273
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,969
It's all for my precious friends!

274
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,412
Then I can't take you away
from them...

275
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:37,111
Naruto, I'll promise that I will do
my best to keep my father's wishes

276
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:41,989
and strive for a peaceful country
where no one will be sacrificed.

277
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:44,856
Yeah!

278
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,395
It's a promise!

279
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,831
Thank you! Naruto!

280
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,404
Good bye! Everybody!

281
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,670
We'll come back someday!

282
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:00,607
Bye!

283
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,268
See ya!

284
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:29,371
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

285
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:36,044
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

286
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,651
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

287
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:58,532
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

288
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:03,631
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

289
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:10,613
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

290
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:17,519
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

291
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:24,289
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

292
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:31,063
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

293
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:37,740
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

294
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:44,774
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

295
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,082
No! He's looking over here!

296
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,920
Of course, he'll look!
Stop complaining and attack him!

297
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,254
No, no, it's impossible!

298
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:57,658
He just moved right now!
He moved, Naruto!

299
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:59,992
Of course, he'll move!
Hey, approach him more!

300
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:02,157
No, no, no. This is my limit.

301
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,131
Come on, just give him
a one good hit!

302
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,896
No, the enemy is that thing you know?

303
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,301
A monster, a monster!

304
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:10,430
This wouldn't be a mission!

305
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,401
Next time:
"Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!"
