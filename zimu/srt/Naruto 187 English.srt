1
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:03,859
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,694
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:12,796
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:29,254
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:34,692
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:37,389
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:45,427
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:52,067
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:57,108
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:02,553
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:07,958
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,121
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:19,935
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:52,769
It looks like
the preparations are complete.

16
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:57,676
So this is the Land of Greens
you were talking about, brother?

17
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,243
Well, it's a small land,

18
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:03,339
but it could be a good stepping stone
for getting ahead in the world.

19
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,644
We've already bought off
half of the public officials.

20
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:10,279
This land will be overturned
on our signal.

21
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,725
As of today,
we're the feudal lords of this land.

22
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,526
Feudal lords, huh?

23
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,258
That has a nice ring to it.

24
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:26,099
<i>Open for Business!</i>
<i>The Leaf Moving Service</i>

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,804
This is a problem...

26
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:31,234
I thought about testing out
various combinations, but it backfired.

27
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,975
With these remaining members,
there's nobody who can take the lead...

28
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,543
But it's merchant protection this time,

29
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,610
so no matter who goes,
there probably isn't much to worry about.

30
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,219
Mission difficulty isn't the issue.

31
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,154
It's a commission from
the Land of Greens.

32
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:48,687
I wanted to send them
a respectable team.

33
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,963
The lord of the castle there
was good to me in the old days!

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,698
True indeed...

35
00:02:55,468 --> 00:03:00,235
He generously assumed the debts
for the bundle you blew on gambling.

36
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,667
It's small,
but it's a nice and easygoing land.

37
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:09,915
There was an adorable princess,
and two boy Ninja looked after her...

38
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,713
At that time,
they both said they'd marry me...

39
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:16,980
I wonder if they still feel that way...

40
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,823
I don't think so.

41
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,526
I bet they've all gotten big...

42
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:32,936
We'll be at the border soon.

43
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,771
This is our last look at this scenery
for a while.

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,808
All right!
A mission, a mission!

45
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:47,385
Wait up, Naruto!

46
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,751
Everyone else was off on missions,

47
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,417
but I've been doing nothing but
odd jobs in the village!

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,118
I was sick of hearing stories
about everyone's adventures.

49
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,265
Still,
we're guarding merchants this time.

50
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,267
It's probably not something
to brag about.

51
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,432
Then I should exaggerate
the story a bit

52
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:09,339
and say that I took out
about a thousand bandits, right?

53
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,771
That's just lying...

54
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:18,716
Oh! There they are.
That's them!

55
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,447
Yahoo!

56
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:26,452
Who're you?

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,527
You guys are merchants
from the Land of Greens, right?

58
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:31,960
That's right.

59
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,630
We've come from
the Village Hidden in Leaves

60
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,328
to protect you guys.
Believe it.

61
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,729
The Village Hidden in Leaves?

62
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,100
See...?
This, this.

63
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:43,567
We were told to protect you
from mountain bandits...

64
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,705
It's for certain.

65
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,473
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

66
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,474
And this is Hinata.

67
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,413
I'm Choji Akimichi.

68
00:04:55,588 --> 00:05:00,116
Um, we received one more item
from the Hokage

69
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:02,388
to identify ourselves with.

70
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:07,726
Hey, Momiji.

71
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:08,999
Give it back.

72
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,001
Oh, it's true.

73
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:14,034
These people are from
the Village of the Hidden Leaf.

74
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,099
See...?

75
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,367
The Leaf Moving Service

76
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,437
Wh What's that?

77
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,777
Old lady Tsunade...
she's done it this time!

78
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:26,976
I see.

79
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,477
I'm Kikusuke.

80
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,222
This is Yurinoshin.

81
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:31,946
He's Shun.

82
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:36,253
I'm Momiji!
We'll be counting on you movers!

83
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,240
You sure eat a lot.

84
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,273
That's why you're so f...

85
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:53,778
Fa?!

86
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:54,778
...full figured.

87
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:56,973
For you.

88
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:59,844
I love people with great strength.

89
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,278
Something like this is a cinch.

90
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:03,616
See? Watch.

91
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,482
R oll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll...

92
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,025
Somebody help me!

93
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,528
That Choji, getting all carried away.

94
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,694
Move faster, mover.

95
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,832
We're rapidly falling behind.

96
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,071
We're not movers, I'm telling you.

97
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,001
Why don't you help out
before complaining?!

98
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,469
No, it's fine.

99
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,745
Our cousin Shun is in poor health.

100
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,177
You don't need to worry,
Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.

101
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,353
I had no intention of
listening to anything

102
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,219
this good for nothing has had to say
from the start.

103
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,292
Who's a good for nothing?!
Just you watch!

104
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,665
Honestly,
it's because you push yourself too far...

105
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,731
I'm sorry...
Shun's being unreasonable.

106
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,241
Water!
Oh.

107
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,414
Mine's empty, too.

108
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,242
Then there's some fresh drawn water.

109
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:05,707
Here!

110
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:10,044
Wow,
how'd you find water in a place like this?

111
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,690
My grandma taught me.

112
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,020
Your grandma?

113
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,649
It's this...

114
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,890
You can tell with this.

115
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,298
What?!
With those?

116
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,261
It's called dousing.

117
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,394
If you concentrate
on the item you're looking for...

118
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,463
these rods will react to that item
and will inform you when you're near it.

119
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,701
It's knowledge passed on
from our predecessors.

120
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,737
When I get back to the village,

121
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:37,248
maybe I'll try to find money
that people dropped with that.

122
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,016
Tasty!

123
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:55,265
It doesn't compare to the water
in the Land of Greens, but it's good water.

124
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,297
Come to think of it,
what kind of place is the Land of Greens?

125
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:03,032
The Land of Greens is...
a small land deep in the mountains.

126
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,377
Everyone in the land loves nature
and is warm -hearted.

127
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,182
It was indeed Shangri La...

128
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:11,547
Was...?

129
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,676
Oh, it's nothing...

130
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:17,280
But, you know, if it's such a great place,
why do you need protection?

131
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,285
It's targeted because
the people take peace for granted!

132
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,327
What do you mean by that?

133
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:33,761
Stuff like loving nature
and being warm hearted sounds nice.

134
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:37,506
But the bottom line is that the people
in the Land of Greens are all softhearted.

135
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:39,575
We live in a troubled time now.

136
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:42,176
Something like believing in people
is ridiculous.

137
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:46,716
Hey, the Land of Greens
is not something to speak ill of like that.

138
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,584
The lord of the castle there was kind
even to us merchants passing through.

139
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,495
To think he'd take up that kind of attitude
with an old lady...

140
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,926
He's kind of disagreeable.

141
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,198
He's your cousin, right?
Do something about him.

142
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,001
R-R ight.

143
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:11,038
He's probably a bit touchy
from the bad things that have happened.

144
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,203
I'm sorry...

145
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,976
Oh, i it's okay...

146
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,519
Hey, that's dangerous.

147
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,784
It's dangerous
to wander around alone.

148
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,520
Brother Choji, look at that...

149
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:33,827
Naruto!

150
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,028
What is it?

151
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:36,059
That.

152
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,291
Wh What is that?

153
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,271
That's in the direction of
the Land of Greens, right?!

154
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:44,170
I'm going to go check it out...
You take the others and go on ahead.

155
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:45,842
I'll be right back.

156
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:51,380
Listen.

157
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,209
What we saw here is a secret.

158
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,647
We don't want everyone to get worried.

159
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,154
Yeah.
Got it.

160
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,255
Huh? Where's Naruto?

161
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,791
Th The bathroom...

162
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,685
I'll give this to you
if you tell me what you saw earlier.

163
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:39,631
Black smoke...
was rising.

164
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,628
Black smoke?!
From where?

165
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:45,534
The direction of the Land of Greens.

166
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,101
Lord Shun...

167
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,367
It's finally...

168
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:58,210
I should be at the Land of Greens
border pretty soon.

169
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:09,923
Wh What was that...?
There was no presence at all.

170
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:20,132
Who're you guys!

171
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,115
Who're you guys?

172
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,944
That headband. You're with
the Hidden Leaf Village, right?

173
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:38,413
So what if I am?
Why are you targeting me?

174
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:42,091
I have no intention
of fighting you guys.

175
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:47,328
It seems the ones we are looking for
are heading this direction, you see.

176
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,802
Those who prowl around here will die.

177
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,206
Did we do it?

178
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:02,938
The Substitution Jutsu?!

179
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,149
The real one is over here!

180
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,264
These guys are pretty good.

181
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,109
Two left.

182
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,079
One of them is the real one!

183
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,113
What?!

184
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,919
Too bad!
Those two are also clones.

185
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,893
I'm going to turn back for now...

186
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,672
Choji! Hinata!

187
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,569
How'd it go, Naruto?

188
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,275
Actually, there's trouble...

189
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,907
Guys! Let's take a break here
for the time being!

190
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,954
Pursuers from the Land of Greens?

191
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:24,457
They said that...

192
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,555
The ones they were looking for
were headed in this direction.

193
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,632
But why would Ninja
be after this group?

194
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,169
These people are just merchants,
aren't they?

195
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,498
And they're not even people
from the Land of Greens to begin with...

196
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,069
Now that you mention it,
that's right.

197
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,109
But what will we do?

198
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:44,744
We're going to engage them if they come,
of course.

199
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,513
That might be impossible...

200
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,379
We have elderly people
and children with us.

201
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,581
You're right...

202
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,088
I know.

203
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:56,054
It could be that
they're not chasing after us!

204
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,325
What do you mean by that?

205
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:03,759
Basically, we're moving
in the same direction as their true target

206
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,066
and we could just be
in their battle ground... or something.

207
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,567
I see.

208
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:14,238
That means if we clear the path,
they'll let us go right by.

209
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,137
Alright.

210
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,838
Listen up, guys!

211
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:21,046
Some kind of troublesome guys
are heading this way.

212
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,417
Troublesome guys?

213
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:26,549
Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious
if you say it like that.

214
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,751
I I see...

215
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,695
But you don't need to worry.

216
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,965
They're probably not after us...

217
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:38,097
It'll kind of be the long way around,

218
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,264
but we'll make it through
if we take a little side turn up ahead.

219
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,175
Does this feudal lord really have this little?

220
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:54,818
He's a feudal lord
who's a prestigious ruler of virtue.

221
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,650
So he would never line his pockets.

222
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,853
But we'll squeeze out a big pile
from now on.

223
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,627
More importantly, has
the young girl in question been found?

224
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:03,653
Nope...

225
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,690
But the two who were tracking her
got attacked.

226
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:09,525
We know the direction she fled in.

227
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:11,933
That young girl just would not be good.

228
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:17,707
If they get away, they may return
with forces from other lands.

229
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,577
If the sun were a little stronger,

230
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:24,446
I could burned down a whole mountain
with my Jutsu...

231
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,547
Then I'll go...

232
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:41,995
Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators
in the hall as you ordered...

233
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,193
Oh, good work.

234
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,367
Without your guys' help, we couldn't have
brought down the castle this easily...

235
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:56,608
Then brother,
shall we go for the hall greeting?

236
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,081
Okay... I'll take care of things here.

237
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,754
So, about the thing you promised...

238
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,127
Oh, that's right.

239
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:13,096
Take as much there as you like.

240
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,593
R eally?

241
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:24,272
Honestly. It's so easy to deceive
softhearted people...

242
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,773
It really is exactly so.

243
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,506
Our lord believed in us
until the very end...

244
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:31,613
Come on.

245
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,551
If you stuff that much in there,
the ferry on death's river will sink.

246
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:42,858
I make it a habit not to believe in people.

247
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:46,790
Especially people
who have betrayed someone once...

248
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,129
Y You're joking, Lord Renga...

249
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,496
It's no joke.

250
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:59,273
C Could it be that you had me
gather the collaborators in the coup to...

251
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,351
You're also softhearted!

252
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,261
That should do it.

253
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:36,370
Yurinojou, it seems they're after us.

254
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,174
Yes.

255
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,574
I leave Lady Haruna to you.

256
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,107
What are you going to do?

257
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:44,449
If we wait here for their attack,
there will be too many to defend.

258
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:48,092
Since it's come to this,
I'll slow them down.

259
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,461
But according to the information,

260
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,054
they are three Janin
who use unknown Jutsu.

261
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,429
I know.

262
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,064
But my Jutsu will not be defeated
by the likes of them.

263
00:17:58,804 --> 00:17:59,361
Very well.

264
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,167
Go, Kikunojou.

265
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,473
Yes, Lady Haruna.

266
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,008
Naruto.

267
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,578
I set a trap for the time being.

268
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,046
Jeez, Hinata.
You're such a worrywart.

269
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:17,617
You don't need to go that far.

270
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,886
Huh? Yurinoshin,
where's Kikusuke?

271
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:22,822
You're right.
Since when...?

272
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,655
Oh, he had some other business
and went on ahead...

273
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:31,199
Say what? Taking liberties like that
is really a problem...

274
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh, I see.

275
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,333
So that's it, huh?

276
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:37,972
What is it?

277
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,336
Even Kikusuke makes sure
to go to the bathroom.

278
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:42,577
Naruto!

279
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,480
<i>Lady Haruna, I shall protect you</i>
<i>with my life!</i>

280
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,622
There!

281
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:00,293
Who're you...?!

282
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,393
I'm Ruiga.

283
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,193
To think you'd
just come right on out nonchalantly.

284
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,468
Then she must in that group, right?

285
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,300
If it's one against one,
I won't lose to a hired Ninja like you!

286
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:15,802
Can you do it?

287
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,715
Have a taste of
the Land of Greens' Flower Ninja Art!

288
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:33,626
Eat this! Flower Shuriken!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!

289
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,308
Too easy...

290
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,105
I don't know about that!

291
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,182
Flower Ninja Art: Release!
Myriad of Flowers!

292
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,055
Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon!

293
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,619
Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh?
Futile, futile!

294
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:07,221
And Genjutsu next, huh?

295
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,140
This is the finishing blow.

296
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,982
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!

297
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:54,277
Too bad.

298
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,375
The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja
can't beat me.

299
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,451
Now it's my turn!

300
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:06,214
Eat this.

301
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,660
Water Style: Liquid Memory!

302
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,312
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

303
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,984
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

304
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,592
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

305
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:58,473
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

306
00:21:58,543 --> 00:22:03,571
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

307
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:10,554
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

308
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:17,460
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

309
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:24,230
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

310
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:31,003
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

311
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:37,681
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

312
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:44,715
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

313
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,587
A running ramen strategy, huh?

314
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:57,099
In other words, we split up
in order to avoid annihilation, right?

315
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,899
With this,
the protection burden will decrease.

316
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,166
But won't the soup spill if it runs?

317
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
This is an example.

318
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,136
It'd still be trouble
even if it's just an example, believe it.

319
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,210
Then, let's make it
the running-ramen -with -a -lid strategy.

320
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,271
If you say so, Naruto.

321
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,010
I mean, do you really understand
the strategy, Naruto?

322
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:16,182
Next time:
"Mystery of the Targeted Merchants."
