1
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,707
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,542
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:12,644
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:29,102
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,540
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,237
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:40,747
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,275
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:51,915
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,956
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:02,401
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,806
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,969
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:19,783
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:47,913
Like I said, I've already told you
everything I know.

16
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,781
You first met Genno at Ichiraku...

17
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,643
What did you talk about then?

18
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,346
I don't remember everything!

19
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,519
That's what we want to know.

20
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,560
If we analyze your conversation,

21
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:03,529
we might be able to figure out
who hired Genno.

22
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,159
W e already know all
the conversations

23
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:08,793
that you've had during
the past two weeks.

24
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,861
What we want to know is what
you guys talked about before that.

25
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:16,065
You tell me that but...
I don't remember...

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,605
Then we'll put you
under Regressive Hypnosis.

27
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,008
Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?

28
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:25,644
Using hypnosis,

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,814
we can bring out the memory of
the past from your subconscious...

30
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,782
Oh...

31
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,192
Just relax...

32
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:35,562
Back to the Past Jutsu!

33
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:47,741
Let's start...

34
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,174
Right now you are traveling
through your memories...

35
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:59,050
A day ago... two days ago...
three days ago...

36
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:01,482
Keep going back into the past.

37
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,317
And... it's the day you met
the old carpenter.

38
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:08,588
Where are you?

39
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,526
Inside... the forest...

40
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:21,364
<i>The Anbu Gives Up?</i>
<i>Naruto's Recollection</i>
I was training on my own...
And it was lunch time so...

41
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,539
I headed for Ichiraku...

42
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,773
And that's where...

43
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,979
You met him not inside
the restaurant, but outside, yes?

44
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,388
Hey, what are you doing?

45
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,092
Huh? Oh yes...

46
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:43,127
I was just trying to figure out if
I should go into the restaurant or not.

47
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,065
Is it any good?

48
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,627
Old man, you're not from here are you?

49
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:53,766
Oh... I'm a freelance carpenter.
How did you know?

50
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:59,906
Because all the Leaf Village people
know that Ichiraku's ramen is the best!

51
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:01,748
I see...

52
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,807
Here you go!
Thanks for waiting!

53
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,185
Yes! This is quite good!

54
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,316
Isn't it?!

55
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:17,698
Thank you for this meal!

56
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,260
You're already done?

57
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,894
I am a growing boy!

58
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,933
Even an extra large isn't
enough for me!

59
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,570
I see... Then, why don't I give
you some of mine.

60
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,801
What? Are you sure?

61
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,244
Yes.

62
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:32,944
Lucky!

63
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,215
Thanks... old man!

64
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,951
So... we said good bye after
we finished eating the ramen...

65
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,289
And when did you meet him next?

66
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,497
I met him in front of Ichiraku again...

67
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,469
Byakugan!

68
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,946
There's nothing here either...

69
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:12,419
I see...

70
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,462
Byakugan!

71
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,707
I see...

72
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,112
It seems like there were
odor neutralizing components

73
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:48,678
in last night's smoke screen.

74
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:50,988
He was quite prepared

75
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,257
Then why did he get caught?

76
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,927
Well, that's because our Anbu Black Ops
are really good, right...?

77
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,223
He should have known

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,234
that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent
before he infiltrated us...

79
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,035
He should have had
other escape routes ready.

80
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,066
Now that you mention it,
that sounds about right...

81
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,204
But right now,
there's no way to find out.

82
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,413
Dead men tell no tales, I see.

83
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:21,655
Over here.

84
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,195
What are you doing?

85
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,421
We're connecting the pieces
of the corpse.

86
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,997
Connecting the pieces...

87
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,930
It was in a really awful shape.

88
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:41,072
From what I hear,
he had Paper Bombs all over his body...

89
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,942
Would you like to wait outside
until we're done?

90
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,441
I I suppose so...

91
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:48,882
I'll stay here!

92
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:49,916
What?

93
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,849
You're quite impressive...

94
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,092
Sakura.

95
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,172
And he gave me eggs and
barbeque pork that time...

96
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,107
He's talking about Ramen again.

97
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,276
Shh!

98
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,235
Oh, I remember that time...!

99
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:21,948
What happened?

100
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,583
He showed... me a photograph.

101
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,987
A photograph?

102
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:31,090
A photograph of a guy that
looked about my age.

103
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,628
When I asked him why
he was so nice to me...

104
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,027
I have a grandson.

105
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:42,963
He's about the same age as you.

106
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,231
So I can't think of you as a stranger.

107
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:53,143
I look forward to treasure hunting with
my grandson on my days off.

108
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,141
Treasure hunting?

109
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,250
Yeah...

110
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,649
What, you're already done eating?!

111
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,488
Then I'll give you some of mine.

112
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:07,989
Thanks, old man!

113
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,533
What happened to your hand?

114
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,092
Oh... It's a scar from a long time ago

115
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,229
when I accidentally cut myself
with a saw.

116
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,273
Oh.

117
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:25,301
And then he gave me
his ramen again...

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,672
Genno has no relatives...

119
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:30,113
Then his story about
his grandson a lie?

120
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:33,749
We started marking him the next day.

121
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:36,155
I think any more inquiries are pointless.

122
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:39,352
I guess he wouldn't be careless enough

123
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:42,054
to leak any information even to a Gennin.

124
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,932
An emergency report
from Lady Tsunade!

125
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:58,303
I see... There was nothing unusual
about any of the buildings.

126
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,606
They were all built
according to their plans...

127
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,575
There were no signs of any traps.

128
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:09,855
So was it just camouflage for him
to sneak in as a carpenter?

129
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:12,185
It's too soon to make a judgment on that.

130
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:15,054
If he was just supposed to
steal the plans,

131
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,256
there was no need for him
to be a carpenter.

132
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,730
By the way,
what were you guys looking up?

133
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,904
We got a list of places where
he used to stop by

134
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,769
from his carpenter buddies,

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,104
and we're looking through
all those places,

136
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,076
but so far we haven't found any clues.

137
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,881
Oh, there're a lot of restaurants...

138
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:39,212
Yeah... Seems like he never
went out besides to go eat.

139
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,085
In the meantime, Hinata,
you go see Ino and Sakura

140
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,123
at the forensics center.

141
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,149
Neji and Choji, you guys go
help Kiba and Shino!

142
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:48,528
Understood.

143
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,758
Then, we should get going too...

144
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,102
Shikamaru!

145
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,004
Lady Tsunade is calling for you!

146
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,332
The Fifth Hokage is?

147
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:07,077
What?! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls?

148
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,714
It seems that they've committed
all their troops into battle position.

149
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:15,315
They're calling it
a big practice run, however...

150
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,190
Big practice run?

151
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:19,918
I don't think I need to say more, but...

152
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,319
It's been used many times in the past.
They get all of their troops together

153
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:27,629
for the purpose of a big practice run
and then invade another country...

154
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:32,061
Furthermore, there is information that
Genno stayed in

155
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,128
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls

156
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,107
before coming to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

157
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,868
It wouldn't be unusual if there
was some sort of connection.

158
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,409
Most of the Ninja we've deployed

159
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,577
have already been mobilized
to the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.

160
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:50,116
Crossing the border will be
taken as a sign of willful invasion.

161
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,714
We will attack anyone that enters.

162
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,959
Shikamaru, I want you to
head over to the border, too!

163
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,860
I don't think that there's
a need for us to go.

164
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,694
Shikamaru?!

165
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,130
What do you mean...?

166
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,841
Naruto.
Hey, Naruto!

167
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,049
Huh?

168
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,452
You're getting in the way of my business
by standing there!

169
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,653
Oh... Sorry.

170
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,991
Now that I think about it,

171
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,122
I've never seen the old man finish
his ramen...

172
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,490
Could it be that he hated ramen?

173
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:38,599
But then why did he come to
Ichiraku all the time?

174
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,773
Tell us why.

175
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,247
Ten Gennin and one Chunin...

176
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:52,076
Our presence or absence won't
make much of a difference

177
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:53,278
to the overall situation.

178
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,121
What is your point...?

179
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,651
I don't like it...

180
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:02,487
Old Man Genno's actions...

181
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,058
After the investigation,
I've figured it out...

182
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,300
His everyday activities were
quite impressive...

183
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,270
His abilities as a carpenter
was average,

184
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,899
he was quite plain, never stood out,
and never made any big mistakes

185
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,677
Nobody hated him,
and nobody liked him.

186
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,547
Even if he were to disappear
all of a sudden,

187
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,709
no one would think twice
about it the next day...

188
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,618
A very low key profile.

189
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,618
It's an undercover technique
that's so impressive

190
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:34,160
that I'd want to put it
in a Shinobi textbooks.

191
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:40,333
A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked
by the Anbu Black Ops so easily...

192
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,534
Don't you think that's a bit strange...?

193
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:44,461
That's true...

194
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:46,905
And when he was trying to get away...

195
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:52,176
He was able to get away from
the Anbu Black Ops,

196
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,611
but they caught up to him.

197
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:57,849
For a trap professional,
it seems like such a lame end.

198
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,650
On top of all that, the plans
have completely disappeared.

199
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,451
It doesn't make any sense to me.

200
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,397
And...?

201
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,131
Everything is moving
along according to his plan.

202
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,804
It couldn't be...?

203
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,167
His true identity being discovered,

204
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,969
and dying in front of
the Anbu Black Ops...

205
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,403
What if all of that was his plan?

206
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:28,905
And if he had predicted that
we would all leave the village

207
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,507
in taking precautions against
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls...

208
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:36,753
We could be just dancing on
the palm of his hand.

209
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:41,452
But if we look at all the information
we have at this point,

210
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,496
we need to be on alert for
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.

211
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,222
That's true, but...

212
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,333
However...

213
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:52,168
I don't think the situation will
change much

214
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,730
just by sending another ten Gennin
and one Chunin...

215
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,946
I'll have the Shikamaru squad
continue to investigate Genno.

216
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:03,716
Understood.

217
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,112
Shikamaru! Choji!

218
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,980
Sorry... I didn't mean to make you wait.

219
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,886
My head hurts...

220
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,389
Hey. Why do we have to
look through these books?

221
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:23,725
I don't want to do it either.
But this is the basis of investigation.

222
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:28,002
But still... There're so many numbers,
my eyes are hurting.

223
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,342
I'm sorry...
I still can't find it.

224
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,146
I see...

225
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:34,480
What?

226
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,446
The old recommendation letter
that enabled them

227
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,985
to figure out that Genno's
recommendation letter was a fake.

228
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,648
Why do you have to look for that?

229
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:44,521
Just a hunch...

230
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,986
<i>Did the people of this house just lose it?</i>
<i>Or did he...</i>

231
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,457
<i>In either case,</i>

232
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,295
<i>he should have wanted to get rid of</i>

233
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:55,733
<i>the recommendation letter</i>
<i>that he brought...</i>

234
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,504
<i>Why would he just get rid of</i>
<i>the old recommendation letter?</i>

235
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,575
This is where he took his own life...?

236
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,648
It seems that they've already
collected the remains.

237
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:11,709
It's a job done by the Anbu Black Ops...

238
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,477
They don't leave anything behind.

239
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:17,217
Everyone, come over here!

240
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,623
Look, the tree is burned on both sides!

241
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:23,689
The Paper Bombs exploded...

242
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,098
There should be burned marks.

243
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,463
The fact that it's on both sides
is the problem!

244
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,194
I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,

245
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,931
it wouldn't have left marks on both sides.

246
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,541
There would have to be
at least two explosions

247
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,133
to leave this kind of burn marks.

248
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:40,212
But according to the Anbu Black Ops,

249
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,147
he exploded the Paper Bombs
that were wrapped around his body.

250
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,949
But no one saw him at the moment
of the explosion...

251
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,788
There may be Anbu Black Ops,

252
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:52,347
but they'd still need to dodge
the explosion.

253
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:59,129
This one's burned on both sides too...

254
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,163
Same on this tree too.

255
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:06,339
Probably...

256
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:09,171
First, the Paper Bombs that
were placed on

257
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,709
the trees in the surrounding area
were blown up...

258
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,445
Then there was a huge explosion
in the center.

259
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,210
If he had set off the explosions
close to each other,

260
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,344
then it's possible to perceive it
as one explosion!

261
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,988
I see...

262
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,022
But in order to do that,

263
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,058
he would have needed to set up
some sort of trick before hand.

264
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,353
Didn't Genno take his life

265
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:30,191
after being cornered by
the Anbu Black Ops?

266
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,992
What if they didn't catch up to him,

267
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,658
but rather,
he let them catch up to him?

268
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,738
So you're saying that
he was running away

269
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,739
planning to let them
catch up to him here?!

270
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:43,064
It's not impossible...

271
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,238
If that is the case...

272
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:48,406
It's possible that he could
have laid other traps

273
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:49,916
Could it be that...

274
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,541
the fact he killed himself with
the Paper Bombs is also...

275
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,088
It's done.
They said you could come in.

276
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,094
Y Yeah.

277
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,998
It's impossible.

278
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,229
Didn't the Anbu Black Ops make sure
with their own eyes?

279
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:09,769
Yeah.

280
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,933
There's no point in telling me
to check out the body.

281
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,441
I'm not a Medical Ninja.

282
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,034
What should I check
and how should I do it...?

283
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,150
Sakura...

284
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:28,580
This man... He snuck in as
a carpenter right?

285
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:31,555
That's right. Is there something
that bothers you?

286
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,387
His hand... It's too clean.

287
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:36,893
My family owns a flower shop,
remember?

288
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,765
I've been helping out
since I was a kid...

289
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:45,437
So if I look at a person's hand,
I can tell what kind of job they do...

290
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:49,633
Carpenter's hands are much more rough.

291
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:53,972
And there's no way that a trap
professional's hand would be so clean!

292
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:55,648
Then...!

293
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:57,344
May I?

294
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,919
Byakugan!

295
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,523
Just as I suspected...

296
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,888
There's no evidence that he's trained
his Chakra Network.

297
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,588
This man has never controlled
a Chakra...

298
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,296
What?

299
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,658
The people from the medical group
were talking over there.

300
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,898
That they have some questions
about this body...

301
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,504
This person is not a Ninja!

302
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,179
Reporting! The spearhead of
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls

303
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,046
is about to reach the borders!

304
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:33,916
They're fast...
What about our enforcement army?

305
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,479
They are gathering currently,

306
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,114
but they're not in position
for battle quite yet...

307
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:43,122
<i>What if they attack even before</i>
<i>we're in position for battle?</i>

308
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:45,463
In any case...
Who would have thought

309
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:46,931
that the Village Hidden in
the Waterfalls would...

310
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,163
Nothing will come of that right now.

311
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,234
Once the enemy crosses that river,

312
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:54,068
we will see that as their intent
to wage war on us,

313
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,402
and we will start to attack!

314
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:56,776
Yes!

315
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,360
Academy?

316
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:17,393
<i>There were no plans for the Academy...</i>

317
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,937
Excuse me!
Could you help me?

318
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,508
Did you call?

319
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,200
We saw that the Academy had
made some payments last month...

320
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,280
Last month?

321
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,454
Oh this. We did some
reparation work for the Academy.

322
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,056
We don't have the plans for that.

323
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,556
No, that's not possible...

324
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:52,392
That's strange...
Where did I put it?

325
00:19:59,005 --> 00:19:59,972
What's going on?

326
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:06,412
Above...?

327
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:14,351
What's the matter, Naruto?

328
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:20,760
What's going on?

329
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:30,366
They should show themselves soon...

330
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,601
Reporting! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls spearhead

331
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:37,074
that was closing in on the borders
has started to retreat!

332
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:38,444
What?!

333
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,173
It seems like it really was
a practice run...

334
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,281
Then where are the stolen plans?!

335
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:50,853
Th This is...

336
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:56,022
This is Shikamaru's...

337
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:58,961
These are the plans?

338
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,433
Yeah...

339
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:05,000
It's written in a complex code
so that it's not easily deciphered.

340
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:08,641
<i>But...</i>

341
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:15,677
<i>Why are the plans that were stolen</i>
<i>by Genno appearing here?</i>

342
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,041
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

343
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,544
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

344
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:51,050
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

345
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,180
<i>Suggestively</i>

346
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:58,987
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

347
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,597
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

348
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:12,161
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

349
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:17,198
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

350
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:22,374
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

351
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:52,942
Students these days,
sure lack civility.

352
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:54,741
They usually do things like
eat potato chips, eat barbeque...

353
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,406
- Read comics.
- And eat box lunches.

354
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:59,509
- Is eating all you talk about?
- All that loafing?

355
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:00,676
Well, I mean
the self study hours are for...

356
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,244
- You know?
- No, I don't know.

357
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,649
They devote themselves to training
even though their Sensei is not watching.

358
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:07,488
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Really?

359
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,259
I am moved! I will back up
their training myself!

360
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,389
Huh?!

361
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,324
Next time: "The Missed Target"
