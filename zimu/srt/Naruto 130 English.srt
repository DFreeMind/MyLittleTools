1
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:16,841
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:21,437
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,277
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:29,549
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,754
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:40,129
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:49,098
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:52,476
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:55,479
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:59,847
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,316
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:08,190
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:11,931
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,263
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,134
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,399
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,941
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,376
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,601
With this, you've woken up, right?

21
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:05,048
We had a hindrance back then...

22
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:07,178
but it won't be like
that this time.

23
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:15,050
I'll show you...
the true power of Sharingan.

24
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,558
Fine... Then I'll go all out too!

25
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,665
You take a good look
with your Sharingan...

26
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,969
at my Way of Ninja!

27
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,433
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

28
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:39,377
<i>You can't beat me by just pointlessly...</i>
<i>increasing the number!</i>

29
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:42,986
You little!

30
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:53,629
I can spot the real body in
one shot with my Sharingan.

31
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,601
I deliberately went along
with your game...

32
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:01,536
I won't go easy on you now!

33
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:11,139
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

34
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:38,365
<i>Father Son.</i>
<i>The Broken Crest</i>

35
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:04,068
<i>What was up...</i>
<i>with those eyes of Big Brother's?</i>

36
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,670
<i>That wasn't...</i>
<i>just an ordinary Sharingan.</i>

37
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:18,540
<i>And...quite a bit of time's</i>
<i>passed since then...</i>

38
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,347
<i>but things are still kind of awkward</i>
<i>between him and Father.</i>

39
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:27,208
Good morning, Father...

40
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,482
Yeah, good morning.

41
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,789
Sasuke... how have things
been going at the Academy lately?

42
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,667
It's boring with just school classes.

43
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,999
I'm always number one, so...

44
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,001
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

45
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,370
<i>W Wow...</i>

46
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,319
This is the fundamental
Jutsu of the Uchiha.

47
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,051
The Sign is as I taught you earlier.

48
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,089
You build up Chakra,

49
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,592
stop it once at around between
the mouth and the chest area,

50
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,855
and spew it out at once after that.

51
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,163
Try it.

52
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:13,960
Okay!

53
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:20,861
<i>Father...is teaching me Jutsu himself.</i>

54
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,340
<i>Finally... Father has also recognized me!</i>

55
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,244
<i>I must live up to his expectations!</i>

56
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,047
<i>I too can...!</i>

57
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,346
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

58
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,696
Sure enough, it won't go like
it did with Itachi, huh?

59
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,566
It might've still been
too soon for you.

60
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:00,237
<i>A member of the Uchiha Clan</i>
<i>is not recognized as full fledged</i>

61
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:02,405
<i>until they can use the Fire Style.</i>

62
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,718
<i>The Uchiha crest...</i>

63
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,282
<i>means those who possess</i>
<i>the Uchiha that controls fire.</i>

64
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,390
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

65
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,465
Damn it! One more time!

66
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,975
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

67
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,982
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

68
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,188
<i>Today for sure!</i>

69
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,963
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

70
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,766
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

71
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:15,550
Sasuke...!

72
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,019
Wait a minute.

73
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:19,547
What is it?

74
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:27,826
What...?

75
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,398
Oh... Don't move.

76
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,534
Okay, finished!

77
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,083
Mother...

78
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,411
Hmm?

79
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,019
No... It's nothing.

80
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,087
Okay...

81
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,128
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

82
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,111
<i>Sure enough, it won't go</i>
<i>like it did with Itachi, huh?</i>

83
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,856
<i>It might've still been</i>
<i>too soon for you...</i>

84
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:32,529
<i>I'm just, getting started.</i>
<i>Damn it! One more time!</i>

85
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,694
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

86
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:48,271
Father!

87
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:49,977
Hmm?

88
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,008
One more time...

89
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,915
One more time...
Please join me.

90
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,420
It's still too soon for you.

91
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,720
Even if I were to teach you
for only after a week...

92
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,294
It's not that...

93
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,831
I've gotten... the hang of the Jutsu.

94
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,093
So I want you to see it.

95
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,318
<i>Failure is not an option!</i>

96
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,163
<i>Fire Style. Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

97
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:36,812
That's my boy.

98
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,090
You've done well.

99
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:44,385
From now on, improve yourself
and soar large

100
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:47,363
so as not to bring shame
to the crest on your back.

101
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:52,969
Right!

102
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,068
And... let me say one thing.

103
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,168
Don't chase after
your older brother anymore.

104
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:15,686
Mother...?

105
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:19,228
Hmm?

106
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:24,769
What does Father really think of
Big Brother and me?

107
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,496
What is it all of a sudden?

108
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:36,641
The other day, Father said to me,
"That's my boy.

109
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,776
He'd always said that only
to Big Brother.

110
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,183
So I was really happy.

111
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,887
I see... Good for you.

112
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:51,354
But lately, Father and Brother
haven't been getting along, so...

113
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,156
I was thinking...

114
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,233
that I might just be
a replacement for Big Brother.

115
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,438
Your older brother's your older brother.
And you are you.

116
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:14,344
Your father cares deeply
about you both.

117
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,717
Then why does he only think
about Big Brother?!

118
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,149
That's not it...

119
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,886
Your father has to protect
the Uchiha Clan

120
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,554
as a representative of the clan.

121
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,997
What about it?!

122
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,599
Itachi is just bigger than you
and is your elder.

123
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,600
He'll naturally be entrusted

124
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:35,105
with that much more work
for the clan, right?

125
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,535
Your father is the supervisor
of the work, so...

126
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,013
it might be that his eyes were
likely to go towards your older brother.

127
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:52,148
But, this is just between us.

128
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,520
When he's with me,

129
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:57,561
your father does nothing
but talk about you.

130
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:06,363
He's just always sullen
and awkward, so...

131
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:27,090
<i>I'll catch up to Big Brother</i>
<i>no matter what!</i>

132
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,269
Damn it...!

133
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:53,247
Big Brother's back is still
far out of reach.

134
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,496
<i>Forgive me, Sasuke...</i>
<i>Maybe another time.</i>

135
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,864
<i>Clan...Clan...</i>

136
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:19,170
<i>You measure incorrectly</i>
<i>the size of your own "vessels"</i>

137
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:24,307
<i>and don't know the depth of mine,</i>
<i>so you grovel there.</i>

138
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:34,749
<i>My "vessel" is</i>
<i>dismayed at this foolish clan.</i>

139
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,457
<i>I feel like...ever since that day,</i>

140
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,522
<i>he hasn't been the same</i>
<i>as he was before.</i>

141
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,335
Big Brother...

142
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:54,544
Today, when school's finished,

143
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:56,807
will you join me for
some Shuriken Jutsu training?

144
00:15:57,482 --> 00:16:02,010
I'm busy.
You should have Father teach you.

145
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:09,651
But even I know that you're better
at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.

146
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:14,254
You always treat me like
a nuisance like that.

147
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:32,514
Forgive me, Sasuke.
Maybe next time...

148
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,065
I don't have the time to
be dealing with you today.

149
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:57,433
You always say, "Forgive me, Sasuke,"
and poke me on the forehead.

150
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,875
And you say "today,"
but it never happens.

151
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,683
<i>Thank goodness...</i>
<i>he's the same as before.</i>

152
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,190
<i>Big Brother...</i>

153
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:27,427
<i>His eyes looking back</i>
<i>at Father that time...</i>

154
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:32,641
<i>It wasn't just an ordinary Sharingan...</i>

155
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,305
<i>And...</i>

156
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:38,574
Father?

157
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,617
Hmm?

158
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:43,679
Are there several types
of Sharingan?

159
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:48,758
Oh... You're already interested
in Sharingan?

160
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:52,726
However, it's still too soon for you.

161
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,124
It's totally different from
the Fire Style Jutsu.

162
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,234
But someday, I too!

163
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,764
After all... I'm your kid, so.

164
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:08,669
Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu
above the Sharingan,

165
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,078
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

166
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,679
Mangekyo Sharingan...

167
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:17,181
In the long history of the Uchiha,

168
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:21,624
it's a legendary Visual Jutsu
that only a few develop.

169
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,964
And it's said that it only opened
under a particular condition.

170
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,829
<i>A particular condition... ?

171
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:46,813
<i>Don't chase after your</i>
<i>older brother anymore.</i>

172
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:52,189
<i>I wonder what he thinks of my</i>
<i>relationship with Brother?</i>

173
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:55,716
Father...

174
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:00,562
Why doesn't Big Brother care
about me?

175
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,295
He's a bit peculiar...

176
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:10,974
He's a type of person who doesn't
care for making friends with people.

177
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,102
Why?

178
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,076
Who knows...?

179
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,781
Even I, his father, can't read that boy.

180
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:26,614
<i>Here I spoke because I wanted</i>
<i>more of Big Brother's attention.</i>

181
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,552
<i>Father isn't against it.</i>

182
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,788
Here, Sasuke!
Your box lunch.

183
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:37,494
I'll watch your Shuriken practice
after you come home.

184
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,466
It's not practice, it's training!

185
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,738
I'm off!

186
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,139
<i>That's good...</i>

187
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:52,879
<i>It's not that Father dislikes</i>
<i>Big Brother, after all.</i>

188
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:59,116
<i>Big Brother graduated from the Academy</i>
<i>at the top of his class at age seven.</i>

189
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,658
<i>He learned to use</i>
<i>the Sharingan at age eight.</i>

190
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:03,921
<i>And he was promoted</i>
<i>to Chunin at age ten.</i>

191
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:08,727
<i>But, I've got the same Uchiha blood</i>
<i>flowing inside me as he does.</i>

192
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,795
<i>I won't lose to him!</i>

193
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,647
You're not gonna tell me this is
the best you can do, are you?

194
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:29,817
You boast about your Way of Ninja
and this is all you've got?

195
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,991
Are you still thinking that
I'm a member of your comrade game?

196
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,158
If that's the case, you're...

197
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:45,860
a hopeless fool!

198
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,472
Stop wasting time!

199
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,634
Give me all you've got,

200
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,201
you number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja!

201
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:29,043
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

202
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:35,416
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

203
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:45,987
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

204
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:55,763
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

205
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:02,502
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

206
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:11,812
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

207
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:23,525
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

208
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:33,968
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

209
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:46,721
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

210
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:52,486
Just as Neji said,

211
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:55,157
it seems Sasuke's in
the darkness right now.

212
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,593
Damn it.

213
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,767
He really did hit me with
all his might.

214
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:04,568
Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade
or anything anymore?!

215
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,870
Don't all those things we
did together in Squad Seven

216
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:11,506
mean anything to you?!

217
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:15,181
Next episode,
"The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan!
