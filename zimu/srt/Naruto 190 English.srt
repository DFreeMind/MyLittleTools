1
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:03,525
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:06,360
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:12,463
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:28,921
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:34,358
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:37,055
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,566
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:45,093
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,733
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,774
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,220
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:07,624
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,788
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:19,602
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,936
A coup at the Land of Green...?

16
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,202
Yes, it seems there's no mistake.

17
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,106
The retainers conspired with
some men

18
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:03,479
and began a rebellion...

19
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:05,081
What happened to Naruto
and the others?

20
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:07,709
Speculating from their gathering point,

21
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:09,448
they are around here.

22
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,355
So they've already
crossed the border...

23
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:15,423
The large countries have agreed
to make this

24
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:16,462
a demilitarized zone.

25
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,089
Considering Naruto and
the other's mission,

26
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,326
they should be in a safe area...

27
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,366
Are you sure?

28
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,862
What do you mean...?

29
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,870
Don't you think the timing
of this request

30
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,308
strangely overlaps with the coup?

31
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:36,338
Then you're saying that Naruto's mission
is also related to this case?

32
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:37,980
There is a possibility...

33
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,577
But there's no time to deal
with Naruto at the moment.

34
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,883
We have to take back
the Land of Green

35
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,618
from the rebels as soon as possible.

36
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,792
If we leave it like this,

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,226
the flames of the war will eventually
reach other countries...

38
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:51,188
True...

39
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,396
Shizune, gather the free villagers

40
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,957
and have them head to
the Land of Green immediately!

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,459
Yes, ma'am!

42
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,285
You've done it now!

43
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,120
What a persistent brat...!

44
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,094
You shouldn't be able
to stand anymore...

45
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:23,525
Naruto!

46
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,122
This is... nothing.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,901
What a surprise...
you got some guts.

48
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:32,469
Then, take this too!

49
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,639
Ninja Art Magnet!
Electromagnetic Illusion.

50
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,911
Naruto!

51
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:51,516
It's useless!
Your voice wouldn't reach him!

52
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,687
The human brain functions by

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,318
a faint electric current
running through it...

54
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,826
If you receive
my magnetic force powder,

55
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,195
it's going to alter your electric
current and stop your thinking...

56
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:07,265
That chain also has
a strong magnetic force.

57
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,040
Now, get buried!

58
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,210
Naruto!

59
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:22,451
Are you okay?

60
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:32,531
Thank goodness...

61
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,760
Hinata... run!

62
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,162
I can't leave you behind...

63
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,000
He is...

64
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,375
He's someone that
you can't deal with...

65
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,344
Naruto... I promise I'll save you!

66
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:50,910
Hinata!

67
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,151
I'll have you tell me
where that girl is!

68
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,585
Byakugan!

69
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,861
Take this!
Electromagnetic Illusion!

70
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:07,131
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

71
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:20,604
What?!

72
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,287
I see, so that is the Byakugan
of the Village Hidden in Leaves...

73
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:35,924
How interesting!

74
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,363
What wonderful Taijutsu, but...

75
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
I'll crush it
with my power!

76
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:55,708
I did it...?!

77
00:05:56,783 --> 00:06:01,049
Yeah right...
That level of Taijutsu will not work!

78
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:17,096
It's useless!

79
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,473
<i>This is bad...!</i>

80
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:44,494
You're not much of a challenge.
I'm disappointed!

81
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:49,397
Now tell me!
Where did you hide that girl?

82
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:54,367
If you answer me, I'll let you live...
That boy too!

83
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,199
If you rescue him right now,
he wouldn't die.

84
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:02,244
Run... Hinata...

85
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:03,877
Now say it!

86
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:08,752
You don't want to save
that boy?

87
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,624
Or do you think you could win
against me?

88
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:17,495
<i>If I say it...</i>
<i>Naruto would never forgive me.</i>

89
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:21,459
Then I'll force you to talk!

90
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:28,735
I'll change the area behind you
into a powerful magnet.

91
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,478
I can change the position of the magnet
according to your movement.

92
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,244
So it's a waste to run away!

93
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:46,988
<i>That brat...</i>

94
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,254
<i>She evaded the attack by throwing</i>
<i>a paper bomb at that very instant.</i>

95
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,795
<i>She's pretty quick witted.</i>

96
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,129
<i>But...</i>

97
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,306
I won't let you go!

98
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:12,843
Hinata...

99
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,981
<i>Naruto... I promise that</i>
<i>I'll return to rescue you...!</i>

100
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:25,088
<i>But, there is a huge difference</i>
<i>in power between him and me...</i>

101
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,694
<i>I could never win against him!</i>

102
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,545
<i>He's already caught up to me...</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>

103
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:52,089
<i>This is...iron sand... ?

104
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:58,424
<i>I see...his Jutsu can</i>
<i>change his body</i>

105
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,465
<i>and the things he touches</i>
<i>into magnet.</i>

106
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,867
<i>The reason why he didn't attack</i>
<i>back there</i>

107
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,963
<i>was to brush off the iron sand</i>
<i>from his body...</i>

108
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:12,635
<i>If he doesn't,</i>
<i>he would sink in his iron sand.</i>

109
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,273
<i>His attack pattern consists of</i>
<i>alternating between</i>

110
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,839
<i>Ninja Art Magnet</i>
<i>and Iron Sand Genjutsu...</i>

111
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,316
<i>He does this to turn</i>
<i>his magnet powers on and off</i>

112
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:23,321
<i>so his body won't</i>
<i>completely turn into a magnet.</i>

113
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>Then, there is one way</i>
<i>to beat him!</i>

114
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,991
Now... play time is almost over!

115
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,827
Now, it's time you give up!

116
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:40,565
I would never give up!

117
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,268
Because that is my Ninja Way!

118
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,309
What a waste...

119
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:47,143
How dare you do that to Naruto!

120
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,607
I will definitely not forgive you!

121
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:52,544
Once you say where
that girl is,

122
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:54,552
why don't you live with
that brat in hell!

123
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,592
Hey, don't be shy
and come closer!

124
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:07,557
Right now!

125
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,796
<i>I'll risk everything</i>
<i>in this single attack!</i>

126
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,580
An attack that didn't work before,

127
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:24,081
will never work!

128
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,152
Is... that right?

129
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:36,624
What?!

130
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,928
We're both going to hell!

131
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,143
Let go, you!

132
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,121
You brat! How dare you play
around with me!

133
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,851
I changed my mind.
I'll finish you off now!

134
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,263
What is this?!

135
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,466
Just now...
I struck a Chakra Point

136
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:27,034
that would make your Chakra flow
go out of control.

137
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:34,112
Now your body will just turn
into a strong magnet...

138
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:38,750
What? That's why you brought me
to this sandy area?!

139
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,285
S Stop!

140
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,734
I did it... Naruto...

141
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:11,018
Damn...! I can't move!

142
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:13,657
The Human Boulder!

143
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:21,762
Naruto!

144
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:27,796
Choji...!

145
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,468
Are you okay, Naruto...?

146
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,903
Thanks... Yurinojou.

147
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:37,172
So what happened?

148
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,008
The second Janin attacked me
and I got beaten up.

149
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,283
What happened to Hinata
and the princess?

150
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:44,149
Oh yeah...!

151
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,548
I can't stay here!

152
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,285
What...?
What's going on...? Naruto?

153
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,319
Hinata is in danger!

154
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,588
- Oh! Naruto!
- Naruto!

155
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,370
Hinata!

156
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,881
Are you okay... Hinata?

157
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:23,886
Hang in there, Hinata!

158
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:29,429
N -Naruto... Choji...

159
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:31,897
Yurinojou...

160
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,140
You guys...
you guys came to rescue me...

161
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,977
Of course...
We're friends, right?!

162
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,173
Yes!

163
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,343
By the way, that magnet guy...
Where did he go?

164
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,117
He probably sunk into the sand...

165
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:54,386
What?! You did it, Hinata?

166
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,994
Yeah... I did my best...

167
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,658
Hinata, you're great...

168
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,597
The guy that I couldn't handle...

169
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,935
You're complimenting me?

170
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,109
Naruto...

171
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,238
Here...

172
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,545
This is... my forehead band?

173
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,879
The mission is not over yet.

174
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,580
Naruto, please protect the princess...
Princess Haruna.

175
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:24,783
Hinata...

176
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,294
I'll promise you!

177
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:34,029
I swear on this forehead band
I will definitely protect the Princess!

178
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,095
And...

179
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,562
I can't be losing against you!

180
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:41,569
Naruto...

181
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,107
Look after Hinata, Choji... Yurinojou!

182
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:47,702
Right!

183
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,603
Leave it to us... Naruto!

184
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:02,526
Well, I'll be darned.

185
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:06,092
I can't believe that Ruiga
and Jiga were both defeated.

186
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,128
Well, that saves some
trouble though...

187
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:19,902
Nobody has ever escaped
from my Jutsu.

188
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,006
Today will be a good day.

189
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,620
Haruna! Where are you?!

190
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:39,525
There she is!

191
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,196
Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!

192
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:48,735
Are you okay?

193
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,545
I'm glad...

194
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,953
I It's me, Princess Haruna!

195
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,080
N -Naruto...

196
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,181
I came to rescue you,

197
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,247
but what is this treatment?

198
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:09,021
Sorry...

199
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,860
Why did you escape by yourself?

200
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,323
I can't count on you guys...

201
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:21,837
I will try to survive
no matter who's sacrificed...

202
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:26,344
As long as I survive,
the Land of Green can be revived.

203
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,680
That's the most important thing, right?!

204
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:31,943
I am a victim!

205
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,987
If I declare that other countries
will lend me their power.

206
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,217
If I take back the country and

207
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,316
I, the true successor,
become the feudal lord,

208
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,258
then people will definitely gather and

209
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,920
the Land of Green will return
to the way it was!

210
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,862
I don't think so.

211
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,331
You're saying that
the Land of Green won't revive?

212
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:54,862
I'm not saying that...

213
00:16:55,841 --> 00:17:00,437
But I just thought what if I lived
in the Land of Green...

214
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:05,411
If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou...

215
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:13,851
I won't guard a feudal lord like you!

216
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:16,283
Naruto!

217
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,496
What do you know?!
What do you know about me?!

218
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:24,196
What do you know about my life
as a hostage?!

219
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,301
Under watch 24/7,

220
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:30,170
not even allowed to have
my own free time,

221
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,971
I was Ionely everyday.

222
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,470
Because of that lifestyle,

223
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,448
I became sick and was
in bed for a long time.

224
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:42,378
I was finally able to return home
after being close to dying...

225
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,150
Naruto! If you're saying that
I'm wrong, then answer me!

226
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,056
Were the things done to me

227
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,063
in the name of protecting
the Land of Green all wrong

228
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:57,627
Then why did my father and mother
send me away as a hostage?!

229
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:01,099
Answer me! Naruto!

230
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,809
I won't count on you.

231
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,285
I will go by myself.

232
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,820
Wait.
I will go too.

233
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,890
I promised Hinata that I will
definitely protect you, princess!

234
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,995
With Hinata...?

235
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:33,370
She fought with
the second Janin

236
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,370
and got hurt badly...

237
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,504
Hinata did?

238
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:41,236
You guys said that you didn't accept
the mission of protecting me.

239
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,781
Then, why do you concern yourselves
with me?

240
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:44,778
I...

241
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,546
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.

242
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:53,514
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad... That's all.

243
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:58,427
Well, let's go!

244
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:00,422
If we pass through the valley
ahead of us,

245
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,625
we'll get to the town.

246
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:05,394
If we do that, they probably won't
chase us all the way there!

247
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:20,649
Please be careful...

248
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,246
No one uses this deer path.

249
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:25,813
This should shake them...

250
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,869
I found you!

251
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:45,907
It's impossible...
to run away from me!

252
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,917
Choji?!

253
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:55,613
Don't make useless efforts...

254
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,720
I'll make you guys my hostages!

255
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,486
You guys take them back to the castle!

256
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,323
Yes!

257
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,291
If you wander around me

258
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:11,063
you might get caught
in my Jutsu and die.

259
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,651
That's it...
We're almost there!

260
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,627
There's no time to waste!
Let's go!

261
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,595
Okay!

262
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:44,696
Haruna!

263
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:46,902
I'm okay!

264
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,470
Oh no!

265
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,244
Wh What is this?!

266
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,974
I see... You have good sense
to dodge that attack!

267
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:02,279
Who is it?!
Where are you?!

268
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:05,412
Here, over here!

269
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:10,489
Too bad, but you guys won't
be able to reach that village.

270
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,758
Since you guys are going
to die here!

271
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,512
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

272
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,185
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

273
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,792
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

274
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:58,673
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

275
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:03,772
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

276
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:10,754
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

277
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

278
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:24,430
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

279
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:31,204
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

280
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:37,881
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

281
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:44,915
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

282
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:54,664
Damn! He is so troublesome!

283
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:57,333
How dare he use many
showy attacks.

284
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,732
There is no way I can retaliate!

285
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:01,437
I've gotta do something.

286
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:05,302
At this rate, I'm gonna get cornered
and shot.

287
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:08,375
But even if I wanted to hide,
Haruna's legs are...

288
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:09,605
Oh, damn it!

289
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,074
What in the world should I do?!

290
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,748
Next time: " Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!"
