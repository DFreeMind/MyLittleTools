1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,594
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:06,429
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:12,531
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:28,989
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:34,427
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,123
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:40,634
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:45,162
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:51,802
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:56,842
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:02,288
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,856
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:19,670
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:46,763
What do you mean by
monitoring Akamaru?

16
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:49,536
You know about the incident

17
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,869
where someone from outside
infiltrated the village, right?

18
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,708
Yeah, I know about that.

19
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:58,610
But I heard that Kiba and the others
resolved that incident without any trouble.

20
00:01:58,913 --> 00:01:59,607
That's right.

21
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,715
Damn! That Kiba!

22
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,815
I want a mission where
I totally kick an enemy's butt.

23
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,581
To be exact, that's wrong.

24
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:10,820
What?

25
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,855
Before Kiba and the others
had the intruder in custody...

26
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,759
he swallowed a pellet
and killed himself.

27
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,388
What? Suicide...?

28
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,197
In the investigation that followed,

29
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,962
it was revealed that the enemy
was a Shinobi

30
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,935
from another land that uses
a unique tactic.

31
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:29,241
Perhaps he took his own life
in order to seal that power.

32
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:34,547
What's the "unique" tactic?

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,345
Something you would call
a biological weapon.

34
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,049
Biological weapon?

35
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,950
It's a particular pathogen...

36
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:49,591
a terrible weapon where someone
infected will gradually lose oneself

37
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:52,757
and have their body taken over.

38
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,268
But how is that connected
with monitoring Akamaru?

39
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,368
Could it be that Akamaru was...?!

40
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,147
There's a possibility he's infected.

41
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,286
He still doesn't look so well.

42
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,356
Y Yeah...

43
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,090
Since Akamaru's not
in his best condition,

44
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,224
I'm skipping training today as well.

45
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,195
Okay...

46
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:37,774
Oh!

47
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,951
Wh What're you doing, Shino?!

48
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,015
Shino, do something quick!

49
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,859
Shino!

50
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,201
The insects suddenly
stopped listening to me.

51
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,704
Jeez, give me a break.

52
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:13,973
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,383
We'll head back early
for the time being. See ya.

54
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,988
I hope... Akamaru gets better soon.

55
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:26,823
Shino?

56
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,529
<i>It's the first time the insects</i>
<i>have attacked a comrade...</i>

57
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:40,896
What is it, Akamaru?

58
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,436
Oh, shoot! I've been spotted!

59
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,283
What're you doing, Naruto?

60
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:51,978
Wh What, you ask?

61
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,319
I'm developing a new Jutsu,
believe it!

62
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:59,288
So as for me, I'm busy and...

63
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:11,263
<i>Kiba's Long Day</i>

64
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:27,852
Is there no mistake, Sis?

65
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,548
I'd say the possibility
at this point is around fifty fifty.

66
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,090
I still haven't been able to identify it,

67
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,365
but these are the lab results of
the blood drawn from Akamaru...

68
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:42,894
But! It could be some kind of mistake!

69
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:48,206
Do you think I, a veterinarian,
would make such a mistake?

70
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,069
Yeah... You're right.

71
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:58,049
What is it, Akamaru?!

72
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,090
Let go! Let go!

73
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:08,460
Akamaru, it's Naruto. It's okay to let go.

74
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,328
Hey, Akamaru!

75
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:15,394
Akamaru!

76
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,135
What did you do that for Akamaru?

77
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:27,036
I mean, what're you doing
in the front yard of my house?

78
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,874
Huh? Well, that's...

79
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:32,377
Anyway, come in.

80
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,290
For the time being, I have to fulfill
my responsibility as the owner.

81
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:37,381
What?

82
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:39,481
What?!

83
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:46,664
Geez! Biting a comrade
of the same village can't be allowed!

84
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,960
Are you training him properly, Kiba?!

85
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:54,836
All right.

86
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,467
It's finished! Perfect if
I do say so myself!

87
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:09,211
Sis! That looks just like
a surgical scar!

88
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,551
What? Really?
I thought it turned out well, though...

89
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,593
Sorry, Naruto.

90
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,460
Have Sakura or someone
patch them up for you!

91
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:18,958
Hm? Right...

92
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,295
See ya.

93
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:21,992
Right.

94
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,366
See you later too, Miss Hana!

95
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,970
Akamaru...

96
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm telling you,

97
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,312
there's nothing else other than
my pants getting all torn up.

98
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,450
<i>Shino's insects attacked Akamaru...</i>

99
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:50,194
<i>He even attacked Naruto, whom</i>
<i>he should know very well.</i>

100
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,330
There's trouble, Lady Tsunade!

101
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:08,275
It seems they were attacked
by someone

102
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,078
in the middle of night training.

103
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,783
Looks like they launched
a sneak attack with quite a few men.

104
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,888
No, it seems there was just one culprit.

105
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,150
What?! All of this by one person?!

106
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,224
To be precise, that's not correct.

107
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,399
It's one animal.

108
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:30,727
There's no doubt.

109
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:33,865
There's trouble, Kiba!

110
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:35,906
You're talking about the incident

111
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,137
where Shinobi were attacked during
night training last night, right...?

112
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,945
It It can't be!

113
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,281
It seems it's as you said, Sis...

114
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,781
I can smell blood from Akamaru.

115
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,628
That's Kiba Inuzuka's
Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?

116
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,470
You jerks.
What do you want with Akamaru?!

117
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:09,906
A warrant...?

118
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:11,103
Kiba...!

119
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,679
Yes, there's no mistake.

120
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,045
Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,

121
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,649
the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept

122
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,688
under the supervision
of the Anbu Black Ops.

123
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:28,027
- Damn it!
- Kiba!

124
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:32,398
We should obey
the Lady Hokage's order.

125
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,109
Damn it!

126
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,177
<i>Akamaru...</i>

127
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:55,913
Here.

128
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,323
Thanks, Sis.

129
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:02,995
This contains medicine that I prepared,

130
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,161
so give it to the vet over there.

131
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,724
Right. I'm off, then.

132
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,055
Naruto?

133
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:37,364
What's the idea of Akamaru
being detained?!

134
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:40,193
Akamaru is the culprit from
last night's incident.

135
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,228
We have sufficient proof as well.

136
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,000
At this point, it's an unavoidable measure.

137
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:50,238
The Medical Team is now desperately
looking for a way to save Akamaru.

138
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,570
Don't worry too much.

139
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:56,842
Lf... that doesn't work either,
what'll happen to Akamaru?

140
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,750
At that time...

141
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,317
there'll be nothing left to do
but to put Akamaru down!

142
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,119
Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital

143
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,152
You don't need to worry.

144
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,393
The Medical Corps will figure
something out soon.

145
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:11,522
Right...

146
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:13,733
Take care on your way home.

147
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,261
Right.

148
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,404
Akamaru...

149
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,535
I won't hand you over to anyone.

150
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,675
It seems Kiba Inuzuka
has taken Akamaru and fled.

151
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,379
Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?

152
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:37,219
In preparation for the worst,

153
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,486
have the Special Pursuit Corps
stand by here!

154
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,554
The Special Pursuit Corps...

155
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:45,922
C Could it be that you're really
going to kill Akamaru... Grandma?

156
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,961
Grandma Tsunade!

157
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,272
It's hard for me, too.

158
00:11:58,445 --> 00:11:59,537
Damn it!

159
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,008
Did you find them?!

160
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:05,176
No!

161
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:07,648
Kiba!

162
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,021
Kiba!

163
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,634
He's rapidly getting worse.

164
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,495
Akamaru!

165
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:25,666
Where are they?

166
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:27,165
They should be around here.

167
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,917
I swore to protect him,
no matter what!

168
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,820
<i>I swore never I'd never let him go through</i>
<i>that experience ever again...!</i>

169
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,396
The Special Pursuit Corps
has assembled.

170
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,368
Show the team in.

171
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:04,805
Kiba!

172
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,946
Where are you?!

173
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,324
I guess I was able to hide
my tracks somewhat...

174
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:36,834
This is a serum for Akamaru
that the Medical Corps whipped up.

175
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,502
I can't guarantee the level of effect.

176
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:43,383
There's maybe a fifty percent chance
of survival.

177
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,013
There's also a risk of side effects

178
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,620
that would cause Akamaru
to go even more berserk.

179
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:51,219
In the event that happens...

180
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,890
It's an unavoidable measure,
but Akamaru must...

181
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:58,327
Reporting!

182
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:03,164
The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has
lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.

183
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,366
Lady Tsunade.

184
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:21,947
That way?!

185
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:23,684
Akamaru...

186
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:25,392
Kiba!

187
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,399
Wh What's that?

188
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,201
It's Akamaru...

189
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:39,533
But...

190
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,135
I won't hand over Akamaru to anyone!

191
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,935
What're you doing?!

192
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,339
Have you come to kill Akamaru?!

193
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,379
No! I just came out of concern!

194
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:54,985
You lie! The Lady Hokage said it,
didn't she?!

195
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,653
<i>There'll be nothing else to do</i>
<i>but to kill Akamaru.</i>

196
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,997
You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!

197
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,533
I won't hand over Akamaru
to anyone!

198
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:11,336
This isn't the time
to be doing that!

199
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:15,399
Something called the Special Pursuit Corps
or whatever is coming after Akamaru!

200
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:16,468
What?!

201
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:25,218
The Pursuit Corps should
be here soon.

202
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,977
Akamaru will really be
in trouble if that happens!

203
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,258
You and I have to do
something before that!

204
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:35,023
This isn't the time to be fighting!

205
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,327
Shut up!

206
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,106
Why don't you get it, Kiba?!

207
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:51,568
Shut up!

208
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,510
All right! I've sighted Akamaru!

209
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:05,319
Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!

210
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:08,859
C Could it be... the Pursuit Corps is...

211
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:12,729
Sis!

212
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:18,836
You gotta be... joking, right?

213
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:20,200
Sis!

214
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,375
What're you going to do
to Akamaru with that?

215
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,073
This is medicine I received
from the Hokage.

216
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,309
I'm going to inject it into Akamaru.

217
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,282
Then Akamaru will be saved?!

218
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,418
The probability is fifty fifty.

219
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,052
If it fails and side effects are produced,

220
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:43,456
Akamaru's symptoms will
get even worse.

221
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,162
All we can do now is take
a chance on this.

222
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,468
If the worst happens and it fails...

223
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,934
You understand, right, Kiba?

224
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,532
Damn it...

225
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:55,840
Even if it's only fifty percent,

226
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,335
there's a possibility that Akamaru
will be saved.

227
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:02,943
We've gotta do this!
I'll also help out, miss!

228
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:07,110
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

229
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:10,788
Kiba, what about you?!

230
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,293
If you're not going to do anything,
you're in the way, so beat it!

231
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,921
Let's go, Kiba.

232
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,062
Just leave that coward be.

233
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,772
You're ready, right?
Let's go, Naruto!

234
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,344
We'll save you now, Akamaru!

235
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,447
Aim for the legs!
Immobilize Akamaru!

236
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,140
Right!

237
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:04,839
Since it's come to this,
I have no choice.

238
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,841
I must terminate Akamaru.

239
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,241
Stop!

240
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,479
I said stop... Akamaru.

241
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,312
Kiba!

242
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:16,748
Kiba?

243
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:21,190
Akamaru...

244
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:31,101
Have you forgotten... my scent?

245
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:39,903
We were always together from
when we were little, weren't we?

246
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:54,394
Akamaru...

247
00:18:55,595 --> 00:19:00,589
Why... why... did you become like this?

248
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:06,535
Please remember... Akamaru!

249
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,066
Kiba!

250
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:13,311
I'm sorry, Akamaru...

251
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:18,508
I put you through nothing but
painful experiences.

252
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:25,722
I'm sorry, Akamaru...
I couldn't protect you...

253
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:32,488
I'm sorry... Akamaru...

254
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,128
I'm a terrible master.

255
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,229
But...

256
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,841
I'II... always be with you.

257
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,668
Kiba...

258
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:22,139
Kiba!

259
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,780
It really would've been touch and go

260
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,622
if the Medical Corps had been
even a little late in arriving.

261
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,818
Without a doubt,

262
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:36,056
he would've lost his life if Akamaru's attack
had hit Kiba's vital spot...

263
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:40,964
Really, it could have been
much worse.

264
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:43,363
That's wrong...

265
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:45,064
Huh? Kiba?!

266
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:48,937
When he came at me with
his final attack,

267
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,779
Akamaru just barely missed
my vital spots.

268
00:20:55,982 --> 00:21:00,681
He drained all his remaining strength
in order to desperately control himself.

269
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:05,456
Akamaru was battling desperately
with himself.

270
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:08,654
That's admirable, Akamaru!

271
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:12,530
Thanks...

272
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:13,828
Akamaru.

273
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:29,914
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

274
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:36,586
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

275
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,194
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

276
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:59,075
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

277
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:04,173
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

278
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:11,156
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

279
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:18,062
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

280
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:24,832
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

281
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:31,606
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

282
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,283
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

283
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,317
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

284
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:55,030
In this world, there remain mysteries
yet unsolved.

285
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,637
We came to the Hidden Leaf Village
in search of mystery

286
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,834
and encountered a succession
of hair raising terror.

287
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:05,541
However, we charge forward
without being daunted

288
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:06,977
by the forest that bares its fangs.

289
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,474
And then at last...!

290
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,479
We witness with our own eyes,

291
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,677
the creature of the legend handed down
from generation to generation.

292
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:17,319
Next time:
"A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:
The Onbaa!"
