2
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:37,448
You shouldn't ever relax, Sensei.

3
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:45,435
I'll correct my past mistake and finish you now.

4
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:52,476
It's too late for you to do anything now. My victory has already been decided. Konoha will be crushed.

5
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:58,661
I am the man who inherited the will of the First and the Second to protect Konoha.

6
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,369
I am the Third Hokage!

7
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,647
Orochimaru, from now I'll show you a special Jutsu that even you don't know.

8
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:11,570
Take this! Fuuin-jutsu (sealing jutsu)

9
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:18,016
Forbidden Secret Jutsu! Shiki-Fujin

10
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,705
A jutsu that I don't know?

11
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,467
I need to hurry up... this darkness is dangerous.

12
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,060
Please show me...

13
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:07,311
What's wrong? Are you planning to be tortured to death by the former Hokage's?

14
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:11,431
So, please show me your Jutsu soon.

15
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,813
He's not ready yet?

16
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,355
It's about time.

17
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:14,768
What's wrong? You seem to be beaten up already.

18
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:22,168
All that's left to do is just catch them.

19
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,233
Gotcha!

20
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:41,299
I won't let go...

21
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,198
Come out!

22
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:26,165
The darkness is gone. What is that Jutsu?

23
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:27,767
Sarutobi!

24
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,472
I'm sorry, Sarutobi.

25
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,219
Sorry for the trouble.

26
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:59,256
Please forgive me, the First, the Second.

27
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:05,571
Fuuin (Seal)

28
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,213
Your own subordinates.

29
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,265
Each person in Konoha is a part of my soul.

30
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:55,570
The people in the village believe in me and I believe in them.

31
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,612
That's what it's all about to be Hokage.

32
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:04,444
Saru. Protect those who love this village and believe in you.

33
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,725
And raise those whom you can trust for the future.

34
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:16,465
From tomorrow, you are the Hokage.

35
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:26,343
You even played around with my own subordinates lives.

36
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,753
The lives of our subordinates? You're still talking nonsense.

37
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:36,215
These guys believed in you!

38
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,591
Come, Enma!

39
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,453
I got you!

40
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,699
Senei Jashu

41
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,968
Damn you!

42
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,644
This is the end.

43
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,127
What's this feeling?

44
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,163
It's hot!

45
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:40,570
Die!

46
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,232
Somehow we have to stop them here!

47
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,252
Where's our backup?

48
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,249
That's out of my control.

49
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:21,143
Ninpo Kuchiyose Yatai-Kuzushi-no-Jutsu
(Booth Crusher Summonning)

50
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,887
That Jutsu is...

51
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,622
Long time no see, Ibiki.

52
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,343
Is it only your body that grew up? I can't even look at you.

53
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,311
Jiraiya sama...

54
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,126
Jiraiya? Is that one of the Three-Ninja's?

55
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:56,205
Hey you greenhorns! Have your small eyes open as wide as possible and watch very carefully!

56
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:07,694
Oh, Be thankful! The legendary special Ninja Jiraiya,

57
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:13,618
has arrived to perform a violent dance.

58
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:20,537
Hey you snakes! Are you scared by my Frog? Come get some!

59
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:26,885
I see Orochimaru finally decided to start things.

60
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,856
Where's the Third?

61
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,166
He's in the exam arena.

62
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,064
I see.

63
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,084
Don't die, old man.

64
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,245
Why didn't you dodge it?

65
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,237
Shit!

66
00:11:47,669 --> 00:12:03,232
Shiki-Fujin... in return for this Jutsu power, you hand your soul over to Death. The price of this jutsu is your life.

67
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,041
My Jutsu doesn't start!

68
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,821
There's no need for me to dodge it.

69
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,382
I'll die anyway.

70
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:20,293
At the same time this jutsu completes, my soul is also eaten.

71
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:24,269
This is the Jutsu of the hero who saved this village once.

72
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:28,444
And from now, with this Jutsu, you'll die too.

73
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:34,414
So, this is the Jutsu that sealed the Kyubi.

74
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:43,181
I'll pull out your soul out from your body and seal it!

75
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,565
I can't control my body!

76
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:01,298
You can see it now, can't you? Your soul is half way out.

77
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:12,659
Those whose souls are sealed by Jutsu will never die peacefully. They will continue to suffer inside of Death's stomach forever.

78
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:24,557
The souls of those who performed the seal, and those who were sealed are locked in a never ending battle.

79
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:32,783
What?

80
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:02,065
That is Death?!

81
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:13,657
Don't mess with me, you old man. I won't let you do as you wish.

82
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:33,727
Die already!

83
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,249
Everybody stay in the line.

84
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,622
Everyone, be quiet.

85
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,718
Konohamaru-kun this place won't get crushed, will it?

86
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,099
Don't worry.

87
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,975
This hallway is under the old Rock faces. They're old but it's still a very strong structure.

88
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,767
That's what my grandpa told me.

89
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:23,220
So, there's absolutely no need to worry about it.

90
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,859
Someone's coming... which one is it?

91
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:36,803
It's Uchiha!

92
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:38,619
So, what happened to Temari?

93
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,375
You shouldn't run away from me so fast.

94
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,573
That's super.

95
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:02,613
I'll guess I'll play with you this time.

96
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,197
Wait!

97
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:13,479
Temari! I thought you were finished by him. You're ok?

98
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,763
Well, somewhat.

99
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:23,686
But I couldn't even hold him back for a minute.

100
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,643
No, it bought more time that Gaara needs to recover.

101
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:31,691
Also, you've forced him to use more of his chakra.

102
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:53,483
This smell is...

103
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,337
The shampoo again?!

104
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:58,026
No. It's Sasuke.

105
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:04,468
And there are some other smells around him. We've caught up with him.

106
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:06,950
Finally.

107
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:18,871
Their movement has completely stopped. Is he going to fight?

108
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,052
Hurry up.

109
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:31,881
What is that mass of countless smells coming from another direction?

110
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,836
Hey, there's somebody other than us chasing Sasuke.

111
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,057
What?

112
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,220
Is it our side or the enemy?

113
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,343
I don't know... but...

114
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:44,637
But?

115
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,487
It's not a human being.

116
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:02,334
Go, Kankuro. I'll take care of him again.

117
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:10,215
Temari, go ahead with Gaara.

118
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:17,127
You're already at your limit. I don't need another burden.

119
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:18,030
But...

120
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:19,222
Go!

121
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,769
Go already!

122
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,125
I understand.

123
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:37,915
Look's like I'll be the one to play with you.

124
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,809
I don't care either way.

125
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,982
NO.

126
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,367
You're going to deal with me.

127
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:56,089
You are...

128
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,765
Shino.

129
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,239
Why are you here?

130
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:08,526
Before you left the arena, I put female bugs on you.

131
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:12,304
The scent of the females is almost nothing.

132
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:18,917
Only the males of the same kind can smell the faint scent of the female.

133
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,094
The scent of the males are much stronger.

134
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,840
Uchiha Sasuke... you go follow Gaara.

135
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:36,084
The battle between you and him is not yet over.

136
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,041
I'll fight against this guy.

137
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:45,615
He was my match opponent after all.

138
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,410
I forfeit. Please continue the other matches.

139
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,723
Leave this to me. Go.

140
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,475
You seem to be confident, but are you going to be ok?

141
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,413
Don't worry. Give me 10 minutes and I'll go back you up.

142
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:13,517
By then I'll have finished my fight too.

143
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:34,922
You two know nothing. I guess you guys don't even know what real fear is in this world.

144
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:42,795
Then, are you going to teach me that fear?

145
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:51,293
No. If you win here and catch up with the others, then you'll find out even if you don't want to.

146
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,635
That's only if you can do that.

147
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:48,111
You, who are strong...

148
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,202
You, who are called Uchiha...

149
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,329
You, who have friends...

150
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:54,401
You, who are determined...

151
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,852
You, who is like me...

152
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,577
I exist to kill you.

153
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:10,034
Uchiha, you are my game!

154
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,904
