To the hospital?

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,290
This woman is a Specialist Doctor.

104
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:01,588
We have as soon as brought back the Hokage here, and already she disappears.>.

105
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,548
Hokage?

106
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,509
The Fifth Hokage.

107
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,181
For God, it is in its interest to make its job very, or will have of the troubles.

108
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,308
Minds.

109
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,438

00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,059
In the beam of 50 meters… seven birds.

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,606

114
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,399

127
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:50,906
Aoba.

128
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:57,871
It announces it to the village and fairies to you to come the Daiymo.

129
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,250
We go to celebrate the advent of the Fifth Hokage.

130
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,209
S ì!

131
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,633

00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,851
I do not know it, but my father has asked to me to accompany it

What happens ?

148
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,607
How much time, Tsunade-sama.

149
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,151
Oh, the small of the Nara family.

150
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,570
You can take cure of the red deers?

151
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,656
They can be had of excellent medicinal ones.

152
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,700
S ì  if it wants.

153
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:17,868
Ehi Naruto…

154
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,079
She is  who is this woman who da' many airs?

155
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,457
It is  the new Hokage.

156
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,045
It has the young air but in effects it is one old of 50 years.

157
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,548
Gone! More is looked at to us late.

158
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,257
Well.

159
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,676
Well, we head to the hospital.

160
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:40,182
Later Shikamaru. I will show  you  my technical new, is fantastic!

161
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,935
Therefore is it the Godaime?

162
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,729
Ehi Shikamaru.

163
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,692
It is beautifulst and more strongly between the women.

164
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,657
In effects she is the woman of the leggendari Sannin.

165
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,494
A Hokage woman?

166
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,331
Not me piacciono the women.

167
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,126
They are egoist borings and.

168
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,674
They have always the pretty air but I never do not succeed to preview their reactions.

169
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,012
And for more they try always than to command the boys…

170
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,723
In order to end, they are borings.

171
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,186
Shikamaru.

172
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,940
If not there were women, not there would be neanche men.

173
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,778
A man is not nothing without one woman to its flank.

174
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:40,742
The woman more boring e' that one that is tender with the man whom it loves.

175
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:46,915
But that she says.? It makes yourself to always sgridare from the mother.

176
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,378
You will understand when you will be larger.

177
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,049
Oups, we must sbrigarci

178
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,094
They are in delay, your mother sgriderà to us.

179
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,847
Sbrigati, Shikamaru.

180
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,311
There are men who make themselves to command like he …

181
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,738
Buongiorno!

182
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,699
You are…

183
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,747
It is  cos ì  beautiful.

184
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,876
Sakura-chan! Sakura-chan! You do not have more preoccuparti!

185
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,711
I have brought back the best one!

186
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,798
Sasuke will be better now.

187
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,176
Naruto.

188
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,517
These flowers are freschi…

189
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,353
It comes every day?

190
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,190
Gai-sensei has spoken to me about she.

191
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,026
Saved Sasuke-kun, I pray to you.

192
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,862
Sure, it leaves to make me.

193
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,110
Sasuke!

194
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,736
Sasuke-kun!

195
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,582
Sasuke-kun!

196
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,418
Sasuke, you…

197
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,366
Even if it does not seem, Naruto is an sensitive boy.

198
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,369
Here, here.

199
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,583
That disappointment…

200
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,046
You have been defeated from two persons only!?

201
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,799
I believed you were a genius.

202
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,636
You excuse to me…

203
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,014
Very well, Kakashi-sensei is recovered!

204
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,016
We go from the Sopracciglione!

205
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,019
Sbrigatevi I pray to you! Gone to see Lee!

206
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,856
Lee!

207
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,860
Tsunade-sama is here!

208
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,748
Then this is your pupil?

209
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,752
S ì  is my better pupil!

210
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,671
I see…

211
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,632
Naruto!

212
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,553
Not tasks that are better not to lose time here?

213
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,932
Ah s ì!  I forgot, I had promised to Iruka-sensei to go to see it.

214
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,225
Vai then!

215
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,061
S ì!  I leave you. You take care yourselves of he!

216
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,145
S ì.

217
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,402
Ehi, Naruto!

218
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,279
You are in delay, Iruka-sensei!

219
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:49,449
Scusami, from the arrival of the Godaime I have much to make.

220
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,451
He is not serious.

221
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,040
And here to you!

222
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,709
Good appetite!

223
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,630
Naruto.

224
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:09,636
Six grown much from the period in which you wanted mine wrap of Ninja.

225
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,764
True, not found?

226
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:18,270
This wraps that you have given to me goes to me to wonder is not true?

227
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,733
But that you say.>.?

228
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,943
You have still much road to make.>.

229
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,237
You must be engaged hardly!

230
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,532
Sai Naruto…

231
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,535
The times are hard to Konoha.

232
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:38,081
From the dead women of the Sandaime and other Ninja of talent…

233
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,001
Our force practically has been halved

234
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,004
But we have the duty to continue to complete our missions.

235
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,549
Why? Since our forces are reduced, we cannot simply refuse the missions?

236
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,426
Not to say it not even!

237
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:54,389
If we refuse the proposals, the other countries will know that we have weakened ourselves.

238
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,977
Kakashi-sensei that is hurt even must engage a lot equally

239
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,898
I have understood, the situation is delicate.

240
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,817
Ehi! It watches that also not esonerato you six!

241
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,988
Even if you have saved Tsunade-sama you must acquit also you of the missions.

242
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,451
Sure! But before I must fill up the stomach.

243
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,206
Ahah.. Hour I recognize to you.

244
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,378
Fa' of your best!

245
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:28,882
Still one!

246
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,759
Ehi! Ehi! two!?

247
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,683
Spiacente Sono…

248
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,269
But you must forget the vocation about Ninja.

249
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,744
Tsunade-sama not jokes!

250
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:05,961
There are of boneses fragments in the sensitive points of the spinal marrow.

251
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,924
Probably your body sopporterebbe an other mission

252
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,596
But, you can recover it the same one?

253
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,431
Even if I make it…

254
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,685
Lee not to listen to it! It is not the true Tsunade!

255
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:27,649
Henge not Jutsu must be one. Who devil you are!?

256
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,000
Not there is no means?

257
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,670
They are the only one to being able to realize this operation.

258
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,881
Not to only it will want much time us, but there will be also…

259
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,884
Of the risks a lot elevates to you.

260
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,636
Of the risks?

261
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,848
There e' 50% of the possibilities that it goes to good aim

262
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,601
But if you had to fail

263
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:04,811
Moriresti!

264
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,659
Gai-sensei!

265
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,412
I will not only abandon  for this!

266
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:29,253
Gai-sensei! Cos' is this schifo!?

267
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,714
My  special prescription of restructuring littles ball is one!

268
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,051
If it eats 100, perhaps your guariranno wounds!

269
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,347
I understand, what it wants to say is that if I do not eat 100, my wounds not guariranno never.

270
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,937
I did not want to say 100 in a blow…

271
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,191
It forgets the vocation about Ninja, you would have to try an other life.

272
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,027
Lee…

273
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,388
Lee…

274
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,621
If you had known it, I would not have asked to you for parlargli.

275
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,122
This is not…

276
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,667
I understand your pain.

277
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,128
But it is best to be honest with he.

278
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,298
It is  better for he to stop itself now.

279
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,384
To wait for…

280
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,930
It would only carry to the end…

281
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:20,113
The Believe your promised. It' s too hard to give me courage…

282
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:24,409
Allways, the feel it. The precious Time with you…
