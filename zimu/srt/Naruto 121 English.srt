But this time…

33
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,210

34
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,881

Boneses.>.

118
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,537
This is my innata ability.

119
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,769
This type. who is ?

120
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,348
It lets out boneses from the body in order to attack?

121
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,538

It is using like if it were a katana…

124
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:49,859
Useless E'.

125
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,954
It is not a simple bone.

126
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:58,342
Its density renders it hard like the steel.

127
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,989
Therefore? Me  I will clear up some  equally!

128
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,927
I have acquired full load control
of the five dances.

129
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:13,373
You would better make not to be deceived
of knowing all on me.

130
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,587

Taken.

135
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,314
Kawarimi?

136
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,288
Laggiù.

137
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:53,474
Eternal damnation.

138
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,330
Those types. they are always approached more.

139
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,383
Merda!

140
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,543
To not it wanted us. The wake of the blood!

141
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:27,923
Eternal damnation. also having saved Akamaru

142
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,484
I fear to have exaggerated.

143
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,989
This odore…

144
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:52,988
what means!

145
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,689
Why. Why they head here ?

146
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,308
I do not succeed to understand it.

147
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,871
I must go via from here in a hurry.

148
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,419
I do not succeed to move to me.

149
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,920
My sight is dimmed from the pain
and from the blood that I have lost.

150
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,074
My body refuses to move.

151
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,063
Akamaru…

152
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,957
It has left here the dressed ones.

153
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,917
Six escaped through the river, eh?

154
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,978
Maledizione.

155
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:18,779
Merda.

156
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:29,979
Eccoti here.

157
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,852
Finally in trap, lurido worm.>.

158
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:44,544
Six good one. You have broken the trees and
attacked with perfect tempismo.

159
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,256
You must it are trained much.

160
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,817
It seems one melodia complicated.

161
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:58,449
You have understood that I succeeded in
to control them with my song.

162
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,450
Far from negligible for a bastard dirt like
you to pick the complexity of the melodia.

163
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,309
But it is impossible that you can
to understand it completely.

164
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:14,424
The art does not appeal to to me for nothing.

165
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:19,136
But, if it succeeds to control them with those flauto,

166
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:26,761
it must it are to us something in the song
that it controls their single actions.

167
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:31,271
It must it are to us some structure under.
Confido in my abilities of observation.

168
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,172
But stavolta the things seem to put themselves badly.

169
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:42,198
I do not know null on the manipulation
of the sound and its he aims weak people.

170
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,863
Nobody is not never survivor
after to have felt this melodia.

171
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:51,251
Supreme Melodia n°9 - Lair of the demon

172
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,676
