1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,568
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:06,403
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:12,505
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:28,963
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:34,401
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,098
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:40,609
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:45,136
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:51,776
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:56,817
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,892 --> 00:01:02,262
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:07,667
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,830
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:19,644
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:48,041
<i>Mystery of the Targeted Merchants</i>

16
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,915
Did they really come this way?

17
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,882
But why come this way?

18
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,521
They shouldn't come this way
if it's as you say, Choji.

19
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,621
I said that because I didn't think
we were being targeted.

20
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,661
I don't think this is
the time to argue...

21
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,097
We have to formulate
some sort of strategy.

22
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:14,165
You say that, but...

23
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,064
What is it?

24
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,536
Have the guys
you spoke of caught up?

25
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:23,607
Then we should divide up
this group in two.

26
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,545
Here it's hard enough
to protect one.

27
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,583
What's the point of dividing
the group in two?

28
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:29,844
N -Naruto!

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,185
Please, tell us what your idea is.

30
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,288
This is what I mean.

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,158
For example...

32
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:45,431
Let's say there are
ten persimmons here.

33
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,362
Is anything okay
if it's a food?

34
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:50,161
Yeah.

35
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,733
Then I want it to be ramen!

36
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,335
Naruto, it's an example, so...

37
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:58,445
Then we'll make it ramen.

38
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:01,639
Someone is after
these ten bowls of ramen.

39
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:04,952
And there are three people
to protect the ramen.

40
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:08,857
And so one person has
to protect roughly three bowls.

41
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,255
No, no. If it's ramen,

42
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,726
we should just eat it all
before they come.

43
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,589
That would settle things.

44
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:21,594
N Naruto. This ramen is
for delivery to someone,

45
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,864
so we can't eat it.

46
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:26,769
Really? But the ramen
won't be tasty if it gets soggy.

47
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,308
I'm moving on.

48
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:31,169
If three people protect
ten bowls of ramen,

49
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,745
one person protects
about three bowls.

50
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,479
But this ramen has
legs for escaping.

51
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:39,216
Ramen with legs for escaping

52
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:42,347
Five bowls of ramen
quick to escape...

53
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,288
and five bowls of ramen
slow to escape.

54
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:51,458
Right, right...
Things are kind of getting crazy.

55
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,793
I see. If we divide them
into two groups...

56
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:58,373
Of course, the pursuers would target
the group that is slow to escape first.

57
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,143
So we have one person
defend the preceding group

58
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:05,340
and two people
for the group that is slow to escape.

59
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:06,770
Right, right.

60
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:10,980
By doing this, as for protecting
the slow group,

61
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:13,681
now one person can just protect
two and a half bowls.

62
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,046
Oh!

63
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:20,087
In other words, the ramen that are
quick to escape are the young people

64
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:24,098
and the ramen that are slow to escape
are the elderly people and children, right?

65
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,501
Exactly.
Not only will the possibility of

66
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:28,627
the former to completely
get away increase,

67
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:30,831
the burden on the latter
to protect will decrease.

68
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:32,970
It's a strategy that kills two birds
with one stone.

69
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:36,135
You're smart.

70
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,814
However...
the elderly people and children will...

71
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,049
I just stated a rational idea.

72
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,747
There's the possibility

73
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,447
of complete annihilation
if we stay in a group.

74
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:47,814
Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?

75
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:49,118
Well...

76
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,652
Then it's settled.
Let's divide everyone up in two.

77
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,356
I'm sorry, gramps.

78
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:59,165
Don't worry about it.

79
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:03,230
It would be trouble if something bad
were to happen to the men in their prime.

80
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:07,230
You've got a wife and kid
at home, right?

81
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:12,436
Then we'll be going on
ahead first, Naruto, Choji.

82
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,840
Right.
We're counting on you, Hinata.

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,185
Naruto and I will deal
with the pursuers.

84
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,678
Right.
I'll protect them well.

85
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,361
Lady Haruna.

86
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:36,465
Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut.
What's your mission?

87
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,069
Is it not to protect me?

88
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,339
Things will be settled if Kikusuke
defeats those guys.

89
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,881
Then shall we get going, too?

90
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,574
I'm counting on you, Brother Choji.

91
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,252
Right!
Leave it to me!

92
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:52,980
Choji.

93
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,488
You go on ahead.

94
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:56,750
What?

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,259
I'm going back to check things out
at the place where the traps are.

96
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:04,327
But if you do that, you may encounter
the pursuers along the way...

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,627
That's fine.

98
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:09,462
Doing something like waiting
to be attacked isn't my style!

99
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:10,667
Naruto!

100
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,035
Leave it to me!

101
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,602
I meant...

102
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,602
There's no point to our strategy

103
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,510
if I have to protect five people
by myself.

104
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:21,850
Right, there's no point.

105
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:29,147
We came down that path,

106
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:31,749
so the trap should be
up ahead somewhere.

107
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,154
I guess I'll take a shortcut!

108
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,108
What's this?
What happened?

109
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,279
Why is it so wet?

110
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,662
What're these wounds?!

111
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,298
This guy's...!

112
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:25,775
<i>Are you serious?</i>

113
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,175
Is something wrong, Brother Choji?

114
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,685
No, nothing.

115
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,485
I see...

116
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,349
<i>I feel it.</i>

117
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,158
<i>Even I can sense this much bloodlust.</i>

118
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:39,721
<i>It's close now.</i>

119
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,561
Huh?

120
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:44,931
Rain?

121
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,869
<i>This is the worst. Rain wipes out</i>
<i>all presence of the enemy.</i>

122
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh...

123
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:56,467
This rain is weird.

124
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:04,549
Gather around, everyone!

125
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,218
Stay close to me.

126
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:13,785
What's... this?

127
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:20,558
This is bad!

128
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,597
What was that now?!

129
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,769
Everyone! Get under the cart!

130
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:28,636
We're already under here!

131
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:30,738
You're quick!

132
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,445
Choji!

133
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,581
Naruto!

134
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,348
Get down!

135
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:39,353
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

136
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:00,403
Naruto! Could you say so
at the start

137
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,272
if you're going to
use paper bombs?

138
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,241
All right. It seems they're gone.

139
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,373
Why did they disappear?

140
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,047
Isn't it obvious?

141
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,322
They have no business with a shop
that doesn't have the thing they want.

142
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:17,150
Thing they want?

143
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:18,489
That's right.

144
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,158
If a shop's sold out
of the item you want,

145
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,254
you'd go to another shop, right?

146
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:28,935
Could it be that the thing that he wants
is in the other group?

147
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,503
What does that mean?!

148
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,566
Hinata's in danger!

149
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,535
Everyone, leave your stuff here
and take only what you need!

150
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:40,010
Hinata is?!

151
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:53,654
Everyone, we'll put up our tents here
for today and rest.

152
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,525
It's dangerous to move in the dark.

153
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,966
Hey!

154
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,637
We finally caught up.

155
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:19,378
Naruto, Choji. What is it?

156
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:23,547
"What is it," nothing.
The situation has changed.

157
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,591
It seems someone among
these people

158
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:28,526
is hiding something important.

159
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,964
Something important?

160
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:36,897
It should probably have something
to do with us being chased.

161
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:41,037
But who is hiding what?

162
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:45,938
It's most likely you guys,
Shun and Yurinoshin.

163
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,177
Don't be silly!
What're you saying we're hiding?

164
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,615
Don't play innocent!

165
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:54,711
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!

166
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:56,152
What?!

167
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,421
Kikusuke was?!

168
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,694
Don't play innocent!

169
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,893
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!

170
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,092
What?!

171
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:08,331
Kikusuke was?!

172
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:11,304
Why should he have to
suit up like a Shinobi,

173
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,501
fight those guys and then get killed?!

174
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,476
It's not necessary to tell you guys.

175
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,541
But if that's why we're being chased...

176
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,877
It means you guys are putting
everyone in danger.

177
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,282
If you don't tell us honestly,

178
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,413
we won't be able to protect
even what we can protect.

179
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:30,455
Kikunojou...

180
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:35,251
Kikunojou?

181
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:38,124
You mean Kikusuke?

182
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:42,403
Yes... And my name isn't Yurinoshin.
It's Yurinojou.

183
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,238
Stop, Yurinojou!

184
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:49,535
The person here is Lady Haruna,

185
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:53,206
the only daughter of the feudal lord
of the Land of Greens.

186
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,176
Princess?!

187
00:11:55,884 --> 00:12:00,184
Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens.
You've grown up so much...

188
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,915
P-Princess?

189
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,960
You were a woman?!

190
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:09,524
Lady Haruna,
it is as these people say.

191
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:13,865
We must not put everyone in danger
by hiding the truth any further.

192
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:21,040
But why is someone like a princess
mingling among merchants?

193
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,940
There was information of
a coup in the Land of Greens.

194
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:27,977
A coup?

195
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,308
The Land of Greens was a small,
but calm and peaceful land.

196
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:35,646
However, it was by no means
a prosperous land.

197
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,323
Before we realized it,

198
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,725
more than half of the public officials
had been bought off.

199
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,294
Who in the world would do that...?

200
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,865
The ringleaders are three brothers
called the Janin,

201
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:48,800
evil Ninja who came from
across the sea.

202
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:50,465
Janin?

203
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:53,372
Yes. They're guys who use
a particular type of Ninjutsu

204
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,308
and are called as such
because of their frightfulness.

205
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,180
They've taken many lives
and think nothing of it

206
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,081
if it's for their own gains.

207
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,482
They treat people like worms...

208
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:11,019
But why the Land of Greens?

209
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,455
I don't know why.

210
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:18,694
But his lordship had Lady Haruna
hide amongst a group of merchants

211
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,291
and got her out of the land.

212
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:25,270
Kikunojou and I were left
with the protection of the princess,

213
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,773
but we were insecure with
just the two of us.

214
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:31,103
So then we hurriedly commissioned
the Hidden Leaf

215
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,010
under the pretext of protection
from bandits.

216
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:36,580
Why didn't you tell us
something that important?

217
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:40,213
There's no way I could have.
My escape is top secret.

218
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:42,648
Besides, what would happen
if I were to have told you?

219
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,219
The end result would've been
you guys running away in confusion.

220
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,161
No way would I do something
like run away.

221
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:51,093
Kikunojou might not have
had to die if

222
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,135
we had understood the situation
from the start.

223
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,827
I wonder.

224
00:13:56,237 --> 00:14:00,606
One of you guys might've ended up
like Kikunojou.

225
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,034
We're actually fine.

226
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:07,247
But to think you'd go so far as to involve
the old lady and the children.

227
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,249
It couldn't be!

228
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,744
Were you intending to use
the old lady and the kids as decoys

229
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,549
and escape just yourself?!

230
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,080
That's right. What of it?

231
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,760
Choji! Hinata!

232
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,929
As for me,
I'm really tickedoff right now!

233
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,760
So what of it?!

234
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:29,166
If something should happen
in the land,

235
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,000
I would become
the only blood relative

236
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:33,199
of the feudal lord of
the Land of Greens.

237
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,470
If I can just survive,
things could be restored someday,

238
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,843
even if the Land of Greens
were to be destroyed.

239
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:45,416
Say what?! Just what is it
you think of people's lives?!

240
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:58,189
Please forgive her.

241
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,465
Yurinojou.

242
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:04,961
Is it not your mission to protect me?

243
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,602
You're still talking about such things...?

244
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,974
Please wait, Naruto!

245
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:14,045
Lady Haruna, that's true for me.

246
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,584
However, these people are different.

247
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:20,311
The mission they undertook
was to protect merchants.

248
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:22,881
It was not to protect us.

249
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,456
Indeed, what we heard about

250
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,464
was a D rank mission to protect
all of the merchants.

251
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,563
Protecting a prominent figure of
a land is an A rank mission.

252
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:38,372
The rank differs by far too much.

253
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,907
Are you guys saying
you're going to forsake me?

254
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,008
Weren't you saying until just now

255
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,309
that you didn't trust people like us?

256
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:48,979
I'll protect you with my life,
Lady Haruna...

257
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,417
Shut up, Yurinojou!
Kikunojou was your senior disciple.

258
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,618
There's no way you alone
could defeat an opponent

259
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,623
whom he couldn't defeat!

260
00:15:57,225 --> 00:16:02,322
That will just be our destiny
when that happens, Lady Haruna.

261
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,301
Watch, Brother Choji.

262
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:19,811
Oh! Awesome, awesome.

263
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,645
I'm sorry about earlier.

264
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,409
It happened so suddenly,
I couldn't stop.

265
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:28,917
Don't be concerned about me.

266
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,722
However, please forgive Lady Haruna.

267
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,623
The Land of Greens is a small land.

268
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,494
For the sake of the land's survival,

269
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:41,501
Lady Haruna was kept under
the custody of another land,

270
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,197
as a hostage all by herself
since she was little.

271
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:45,831
Hostage?

272
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:50,274
It frequently happens in
a small land in a war torn world.

273
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:55,180
When Lady Haruna returned
from the other land,

274
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,844
she had completely lost her feelings
of trust towards people.

275
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,123
Lady Haruna is also
a victim of a turbulent world.

276
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,390
There's a village

277
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:10,431
about one league down
the mountain from here.

278
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:11,695
For the time being,

279
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,064
we'll leave the old woman
and the others there.

280
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:16,027
Be careful now.

281
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:17,829
You guys, too!

282
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,535
Bye!

283
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,735
Why are you separating them from us?

284
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:25,838
They still have value for
my personal use.

285
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,106
Are you still going on about that?

286
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,752
They went so far as to discard
their merchandise for your sake.

287
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,681
Then we should also leave this place.

288
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:36,821
We must not.

289
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,221
If we go into hiding,

290
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,819
there's a possibility of
that group being attacked again.

291
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:47,528
Exactly. This time,
it's our turn to be the decoy

292
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:48,933
in order to protect them.

293
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,669
Do as you like!

294
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:09,449
Hinata, I'll take care of things here.
Please rest a while.

295
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,025
Yeah, do that.

296
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,727
Th Then, if you insist.

297
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:31,110
Oh, yeah. Here.
Kikunojou was holding this.

298
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,076
Thanks, Naruto.

299
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,816
Kikunojou was a master
of the Flower Ninjutsu

300
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:41,913
passed down in the Land of Greens.

301
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,321
We learned together
when we were little

302
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:47,884
and I couldn't beat him even once...

303
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:52,799
Now I have forever lost
the chance to beat him.

304
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,600
No... You still have a chance.

305
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:56,798
What?

306
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:01,003
If you beat the guy
who defeated Kikunojou,

307
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,373
you will have beaten Kikunojou!

308
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,510
Naruto... You're exactly right...!

309
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:07,840
Here they come!

310
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,542
Other than the fact that
the enemy uses water,

311
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,587
we have absolutely no idea
what they'll come at us with.

312
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:15,552
I know.

313
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,787
Go! Flower Ninja Art:!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.

314
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:32,231
What?!

315
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:35,001
He changed the trajectory in mid -air?!

316
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:41,307
Oh, no!

317
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,175
I finally got you!

318
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:46,978
Gotcha.

319
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,287
To think you'd
make me look like a fool.

320
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,985
So you finally show yourself.

321
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:56,429
I will avenge Kikunojou!

322
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,866
Try it if you can.

323
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,264
I won't let you get away!

324
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:19,319
Too bad. You're one person short.

325
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,049
I've set a share for one more.

326
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,688
I don't know about that.

327
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:43,301
First, I'll take care of you, boy.

328
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,844
Water Style: Liquid Memory!

329
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,617
Naruto!

330
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,314
And this!

331
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:57,288
Summoning Jutsu!

332
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,126
<i>What is it?</i>

333
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:04,190
Is that...?

334
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:07,031
<i>The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!</i>

335
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,199
Vanish and die!

336
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,523
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

337
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,195
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

338
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,803
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

339
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,683
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

340
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:04,782
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

341
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:11,764
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

342
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:18,671
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

343
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:25,440
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

344
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:32,214
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

345
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:38,891
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

346
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:45,925
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

347
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,140
What is this huge thing?

348
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,937
I don't wanna become its food.

349
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,807
Let me tell you one thing.
I'm not tasty.

350
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,971
I'm not tasty, either.

351
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,513
But Choji would be more
worthwhile to eat.

352
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,549
