1
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:16,884
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:21,480
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,320
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,591
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,797
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:40,172
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:45,546
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:49,141
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,519
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:55,522
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,890
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:02,359
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,232
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,936
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:14,305
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:19,177
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,442
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,984
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:27,419
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:49,201
<i>Blaze Away, Byakugan!</i>
<i>This is My Ninja Way!!</i>

21
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,113
Kiba!

22
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:57,718
Naruto!

23
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,821
This isn't good.

24
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:04,054
Oh my, what's wrong?

25
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,116
So you'll just stay there
and become larvae food?

26
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,320
Queen Bee...

27
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,728
That kind of stuff shouldn't
be effective, should it?!

28
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,479
<i>Chakra...!</i>

29
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,081
<i>Byakugan!</i>

30
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,165
<i>It's no good... There's no way</i>
<i>I can make it in time!</i>

31
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>Naruto...</i>

32
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:59,111
<i>I don't know when to give up!</i>

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,240
<i>That's right...</i>

34
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:08,017
<i>I know that Naruto would never give up,</i>
<i>no matter what the situation is!</i>

35
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,748
Hey, did you catch them?

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,644
What a foolish group!

37
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,614
They made this creature mad...

38
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,125
And they all got bound in wax!

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,860
Bees make wax...

40
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:51,555
You're an insect handler
and you don't know that?

41
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,034
He's right!
C'mon, are you really an insect handler?

42
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,237
What about the Bikochu?

43
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,439
Nothing.

44
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,264
We did an all out mobilization
and searched,

45
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,605
but we haven't found it.

46
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,037
Aren't these guys carrying it?

47
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,338
That's unthinkable.

48
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,378
So that means...

49
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:13,413
So we're going to have to
ask one of these guys, after all.

50
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,584
Who's gonna talk?!

51
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,750
We can tell you.

52
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,259
Shino!

53
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:22,897
However...
It's in exchange for Hinata.

54
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,599
That's stupid, isn't it? To bargain...

55
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,894
Do you not understand your position?

56
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,539
You guys definitely will <i>not</i>
find the Bikochu.

57
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,108
And you're pressed for time.

58
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:42,513
You are the ones... who will regret it.

59
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,609
What should we do?

60
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,016
If things stay like this,

61
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,353
the Bikochu won't be of any help
even if it hatches.

62
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,725
In that case, our mission is also...

63
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:56,527
But...

64
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:59,658
If we can get rid of even one
of the Aburame family...

65
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:08,943
Hinata...

66
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:11,108
Are you worried?

67
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,073
Of course!

68
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,373
She's strong.

69
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,347
Huh?

70
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,346
Much more... than you think.

71
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,528
I concede. We have a deal.

72
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,892
First of all, we need our friend.

73
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,090
What happened?

74
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,956
The brat... isn't here.

75
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:05,095
The wax she was trapped in isn't there...

76
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,935
She may have been swept out
to the waterfall.

77
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:10,567
Jibachi!

78
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:15,803
It can't be helped! I warned her not
to make a bad move or she'd die.

79
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,235
You!

80
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,939
What did you do to Hinata?!

81
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:24,246
What happened to Hinata! Hey!

82
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,216
Shut up, kid.

83
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:31,157
The kid's probably in
the depths of hell about now.

84
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,489
Damn you!

85
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:37,563
Aha, the girl's your girlfriend?

86
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:43,227
You...! I absolutely will <i>not</i> forgive you!

87
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:48,772
You're kidding me.
What can you do looking like that?

88
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,410
Without Hinata you'll never get
your hands on the Bikochu either.

89
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:55,979
You are right...

90
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,451
That girl's death was not part
of the plan,

91
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:02,422
but in the end, it's a good thing.

92
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:09,729
Because... we'll take your lives in return.

93
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,665
From the very beginning, people from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and

94
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,636
from my own Village Hidden in the Stones
have been sworn enemies.

95
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,967
It's natural that we kill
each other, isn't it?

96
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,938
What're ya gonna do, little guy?

97
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:28,848
Die like this?

98
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:36,619
Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is,
I could save you for now.

99
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,193
- All right.
- Don't you dare tell them!

100
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:50,670
Those jerks,
I'm going to blow them away!

101
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,240
Shut up, brat!

102
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,316
- Jibachi?
- Hey!

103
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,954
Shut up, I've got to kill him!

104
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:24,666
It's a Paper Bomb!

105
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,016
You're...!

106
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:46,750
Y You're...!

107
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,259
...still alive!

108
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:10,377
<i>That was really close.</i>
<i>But I didn't give up, just like Naruto...</i>

109
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,251
Did she escape from the wax?
It can't be!

110
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,688
These are not ordinary kids.

111
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,462
Leave it to me!

112
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,361
Hinata!

113
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:30,002
<i>I've never used that in an actual fight...</i>

114
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,399
<i>But I have to do it here, now!</i>

115
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,509
Bee Bombs Jutsu!

116
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,273
1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!

117
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,473
Bee Swarm Jutsu!

118
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,720
<i>Naruto...</i>

119
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,258
<i>Naruto... Watch me.</i>

120
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,567
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!

121
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:08,667
- What?!
- What?!

122
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,213
You're kidding, right?

123
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,817
That Hinata can do
such an amazing Jutsu?

124
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,984
The Hinata that you know, Naruto,
is from when?

125
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,925
What do you mean?

126
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,727
You've learned new Jutsu
since the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven't you?

127
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,831
Hinata has been steadily developing, too.

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,102
She always has been concerned...

129
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,947
<i>Take aim.</i>

130
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,684
<i>That's nice, the three of you,</i>

131
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,316
<i>all have something you're good at</i>
<i>and something you like.</i>

132
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,654
<i>Hinata, you should find something, too...</i>

133
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,286
<i>You're right.</i>

134
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,358
<i>By the way, what is it?</i>

135
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,532
<i>You had some business with me,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

136
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:11,300
<i>Yeah...</i>

137
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,342
<i>I want you to join me</i>
<i>in my training.</i>

138
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:22,605
Hinata was fretting over
what she could do...

139
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:24,115
What she should do...

140
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,258
<i>Hinata!</i>

141
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,023
<i>Hey, I don't think that we should...</i>

142
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:38,565
<i>No... Don't go easy on me!</i>

143
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,562
<i>If you're doing it for me...</i>

144
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:46,234
<i>Do it seriously!</i>

145
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:48,999
<i>I've got it!</i>

146
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,679
During the harsh training,

147
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,581
Hinata discovered her own styles...
and her own special Jutsu.

148
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:09,395
<i>That's the result of her training.</i>

149
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:18,198
Huh? You, why!?

150
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,407
I'll tell you something...

151
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,376
Angering the Queen Bee,
getting encased in wax,

152
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:26,345
it was all part of the strategy.

153
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:30,709
With our Chakra being sucked
and being immobilized,

154
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:34,744
it was the only way to protect ourselves
from the larvae...

155
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:42,562
And, do you think I was doing nothing
while I was captured?

156
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:48,566
I was ordering my bugs.
The wax we're wrapped in is very weak.

157
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,641
Shino!

158
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,437
Because of her hard training,

159
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,177
Hinata's Chakra control
has dramatically improved.

160
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,616
That Jutsu is what she developed
from the training...

161
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,188
Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!

162
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:19,863
Hinata's already flexible body combined
with fine-tuned Chakra control

163
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,632
could completely defend
an attack from every direction...

164
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,502
Truly, it's an ultimate defense Jutsu.

165
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,710
Yet it's different from
Neji's 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.

166
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,347
It's Hinata's own Jutsu...

167
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,716
She finally worked that out on her own.

168
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,521
She probably did it because she wanted
to be acknowledged by her father.

169
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,923
To be acknowledged by everyone...

170
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:54,299
And to be acknowledged by you.

171
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,409
Our Jutsu isn't effective at all?!

172
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,182
What the hell is going on?

173
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,073
What a girl!

174
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,820
Hey, what happened to those guys?!

175
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,283
When did they?!

176
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:21,659
Summoning Jutsu!

177
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,102
Blow them away!

178
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,207
Hinata!

179
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,150
Shino!

180
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:52,017
Believe... in her.

181
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,725
<i>Make the Chakra...</i>

182
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,803
<i>sharper, stronger...</i>

183
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,633
<i>bigger, more flexible...</i>

184
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:14,312
<i>more...more...more...</i>
<i>more...more...more...more!</i>

185
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:30,386
Hinata!

186
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,931
Hinata!

187
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,632
Naruto...

188
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:44,742
Hinata, that's an awesome Jutsu!
You're really awesome!

189
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,839
Naruto!

190
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,216
Let's hurry. It'll be dawn soon.

191
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:55,616
- Okay!
- Yeah!

192
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,864
Oh, it's becoming a pupa already?

193
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:15,636
If we make it smell Sasuke's scent
at the moment it hatches,

194
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,301
the mission is complete.

195
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:18,478
Right!

196
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,683
Sasuke... Wait for me!

197
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,816
No way!

198
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,787
Inside the tree, huh.

199
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,849
If it was there,
the bees should have found it...

200
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,619
You can still move?

201
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:41,992
This insect cage was coated
with secret Aburame family insect repellent.

202
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:43,931
Wh What?

203
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:48,130
The bees won't come close
because of the repellent.

204
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:53,371
As long as you're using bees to search...
you definitely won't find it.

205
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,686
I expected as much.

206
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,315
I think as long as your clan exists...

207
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:07,486
my clan maybe destined to
be ruined some day.

208
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,123
But!

209
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,604
I absolutely will not let you
succeed at your mission!

210
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:24,144
Even if it kills me, that Bikochu...

211
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,044
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

212
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,985
This is our hope...
in order to get our friend back!

213
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,519
I won't let you do that!

214
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,057
Shut up!

215
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,790
Rasengan!

216
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,868
Hey, look...

217
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:02,738
The pupa is hatching!

218
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,181
Okay!

219
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:05,913
Huh? It's gone!

220
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,720
You had it'til just a minute ago!

221
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,680
Hey, search for it, hurry!

222
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:11,588
R-Right...

223
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,195
Byakugan!

224
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:18,960
Naruto! Over there.

225
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,903
You blew it away the instant you set off
the Rasengan!

226
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:26,701
Hurry!

227
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,306
I know!

228
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,268
C'mon, c'mon.

229
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:34,181
It's going to hatch!

230
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:53,826
We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this...

231
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,812
Wh Why...?!

232
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:13,747
That thing just now doesn't count!
C'mon, sniff Sasuke's smell!

233
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:14,852
It's all over now.

234
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:15,616
Huh?

235
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:24,223
Hey! Stop! Wait!

236
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,565
So you failed because you farted!

237
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:30,331
Take responsibility!

238
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,003
What are you saying that for?!

239
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,678
Well then...

240
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,652
That's... the Bikochu, isn't it?

241
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:54,857
Naruto... I found you!

242
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,857
C'mon, forgive me already, Sakura!

243
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,369
No! I absolutely will not forgive you!

244
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:08,063
- Sakura, you look so scary!
- Come back here!

245
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,644
So the mission failed...

246
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,912
It seems that they succeeded
at protecting the Bikochu,

247
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:18,108
but failed at getting it to smell
the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.

248
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,846
I see... Hinata must be depressed.

249
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:25,419
This strategy was her idea, wasn't it?

250
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,059
Well... Looks like that's not the case.

251
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:36,166
Hinata... I heard that your mission failed.

252
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,034
Yes. It didn't work at all.

253
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,734
I have to train more and more...
and work harder next time!

254
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,872
I I see... Good luck.

270
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:54,137
What! Why do I have to go on
such an easy mission?!

271
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,770
Don't complain! You're the one
who picked up this mission's client!

272
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:02,304
That's no reason!
After all, I'm busy with a lot stuff!

273
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,317
That's enough,
or I'll send you back to the Academy!

274
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,386
That's not fair...

275
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,548
No arguments!
Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!

276
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:13,091
The four of you,
I'm delivering your new mission.
