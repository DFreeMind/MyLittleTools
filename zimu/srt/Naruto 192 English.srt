1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:03,792
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,627
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:12,729
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:29,188
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:37,322
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:57,041
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:02,487
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:07,891
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,055
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:19,869
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,196
I'll give it to you straight...

16
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:48,032
Your next mission was commissioned
by a certain Feudal Lord's daughter.

17
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,401
You are to act as her double.

18
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't know where she heard about you,

19
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,063
but you apparently bear
a striking resemblance to the princess.

20
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,533
Therefore she requested
that you be the one who carries it out...

21
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,876
A double...?

22
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,676
Is someone targeting the princess?

23
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:06,016
Well, if anything,
she's the one who's doing the targeting...

24
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,653
Huh?

25
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,222
Not to worry.

26
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,822
You're already an admirable
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

27
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,427
Furthermore, I've arranged for you
to have an assistant.

28
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:17,429
Assistant?

29
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:21,426
Grandma Tsunade!
You have a mission for me?

30
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,035
And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!

31
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,999
Huh?!
Lady Tsunade!

32
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,169
Sorry, but all the other guys
are too busy.

33
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,066
Just me and this guy?

34
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,645
Yup.
Do your best to carry out the mission.

35
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,622
The client is
a Feudal Lord's daughter, huh...

36
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,752
Wow... I guess that means that
I've finally became good enough

37
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,919
to handle amazing missions
like this, huh?!

38
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,990
Hey, don't get too excited.

39
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,423
Terrible things happen
when you're like that.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,694
I know...
Just leave things in my capable hands!

41
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,763
You're really a piece of work...

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,671
<i>Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!</i>

43
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,088
Thank you for coming from afar.

44
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:19,714
<i>That's the client?</i>

45
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,526
<i>She and Ino really do look alike, but...</i>

46
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,025
<i>I It's a bit of a stretch...</i>

47
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,303
It's all right.
I have an idea of what you wish to say.

48
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:38,734
My physique doesn't really resemble
that of the double there...

49
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,569
That's what you're thinking, right?

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,347
- Oh... not at all... Umm...
- To be honest,

51
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,544
- I don't think you resemble her at all.
- Hey!

52
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,311
Well, I don't blame you for thinking that.
But here, have a look at this!

53
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,828
T That's... Ino!

54
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,857
That's what I looked like
a short time ago...

55
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,690
Truth be told, I only got like this

56
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,930
after it was decided that
I was to have an arranged courtship.

57
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,071
An arranged courtship?!

58
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,265
The other party is Master Chikara
from the neighboring Land of Udon.

59
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,141
Ever since I saw his picture,

60
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,307
my feelings for him
have deepened day by day.

61
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,515
And as the day
of the arranged courtship grows closer,

62
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,986
I have become increasingly nervous,
my cheeks have been flushed,

63
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,921
and my heart has been pounding.

64
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,688
I can't even sleep at night.

65
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:35,231
And because of that stress,
I've started overeating...

66
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:38,535
It goes without saying that
you'll get fat if you pig out.

67
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,798
Of course,
I've taken appropriate countermeasures!

68
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,974
I've been using something that cuts all
the fats and carbohydrates that I ingest...

69
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:47,239
"Easy -Peasy Slim Special

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,111
It didn't work, did it?

71
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:54,142
I placed too strong hopes in it...

72
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,319
How can I possibly have
an arranged courtship

73
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,721
with the man I'm infatuated with
when I look like this?

74
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,924
So that's my situation...
Now, let's get to the main issue.

75
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,291
I want you to attend
the arranged courtship in my place

76
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,493
and make it a success at any cost.

77
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,104
Huh?!
So this double thing

78
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,071
is just to act on you behalf
at some arranged courtship?!

79
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,341
What do you mean by
"some arranged courtship"?!

80
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:19,941
I mean, when you talk about doubles,
you thinks of situations

81
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,071
where someone's life is in danger
and that sort of thing.

82
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:23,581
What are you talking about?!

83
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:27,219
The princess's entire life is at stake!
This is major!

84
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,017
Oh! So you understand a heart in love...

85
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,916
I sure do...
A girl always wants to look cute

86
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,621
for the guy she loves.

87
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,127
Even if she's a fake?

88
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:42,933
It can't be helped.
I mean, guys prefer slender girls.

89
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:44,994
That's exactly right!

90
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,629
I'm counting on you.

91
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,331
Sure thing! Leave it to me!

92
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,667
But even if
the arranged courtship goes well...

93
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,076
The gap is just too big.

94
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,613
I'll just have to lose weight
by the day of the wedding.

95
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,110
I already have a plan in place for that.

96
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:05,146
This supplemental type diet food,
"Supplement Slender"!

97
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,522
If I supplement all three meals with this...

98
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,494
Why don't you draw on the lessons
you're supposed to have learned...?

99
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:15,960
In any case, I'll use my charms to make
this arranged courtship a success!

100
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,809
This annex is where
I often played in my childhood.

101
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:32,245
I plan to use this to listen in on
the arranged courtship from here.

102
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,754
Huh... That's pretty convenient.

103
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:39,053
I would love to meet him in person
if I could, but...

104
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,819
Hey, is he that cool looking?

105
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:45,788
Of course he is!

106
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,364
He's someone with
something really special about him!

107
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,797
Well then,
just make sure he falls for you.

108
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:54,534
Leave it to me!

109
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,870
I thought you weren't motivated...

110
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,172
Well, this is a mission after all.

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,871
So I think I'll pull myself together
and hustle!

112
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:06,217
Don't do anything unnecessary, okay!

113
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,156
W What's up?

114
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,749
The sound is getting closer!

115
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,960
- What?
- It's so bright!

116
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,132
There are many a handsome man
in this world,

117
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:26,296
but this man is
renowned even among them!

118
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,000
This man makes
Land of Udon what it is...

119
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,374
that sexy man
with glistening sidelong glances!

120
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,813
The oh so great young prince Chikara...

121
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,612
Kneel down and bow before him!

122
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,157
Sorry.

123
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,556
It appears that
I have kept you waiting, princess

124
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:49,961
You're... Master Chikara?

125
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,062
He's even more intense than
Intense Brow Sensei.

126
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,676
I'm sorry, pretty girl.

127
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,839
I have constitutional low blood pressure.

128
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,615
Dunno. He looks more like
he has high blood pressure to me...

129
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:17,484
What?

130
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:20,492
D Do you always scatter
flower petals?

131
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,254
Flowers are wonderful.

132
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:24,353
They truly allay the fatigue
of your mind and your body.

133
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:26,087
Don't you find them relaxing?

134
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,297
I I guess...

135
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,059
Okay then, next...

136
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:38,808
Hey, don't you think
he's different from her description...?

137
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:39,978
I mean, he's fa...

138
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,113
Fa?!

139
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,381
Stop!

140
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,913
These sweets are really fabulous,
aren't they?

141
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,117
Do excuse us a little.

142
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,919
What the heck are you doing,
out of the blue like that?!

143
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,420
It's women's intuition.

144
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,593
I got the same vibe from him as Choji.

145
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,266
That word is probably taboo.

146
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,468
Oh, I see!

147
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,463
Gimme a break!

148
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:08,530
What's up with that uselessly
intense chubby guy showing up

149
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:10,906
when she told us
he'd be a handsome prince?!

150
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,776
But wouldn't his physique
be a perfect match for her?

151
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,877
I'm sure there must be some mistake.

152
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:18,640
There's no way a girl
would fall in love with a guy like that.

153
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,616
But maybe that's
the princess' taste in men...

154
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:23,649
That's impossible. I mean...

155
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:24,690
He's flashy!

156
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:25,724
Intense...!

157
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,758
And a fatso!

158
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,657
He's a freak! A freak!

159
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:31,094
There's gotta be a mistake!
I'm sure of it!

160
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:32,892
Y You think so?

161
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,691
What are you saying?

162
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:43,237
There's no mistake that that's
Master Chikara, the man of my heart.

163
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:44,943
I thought so...

164
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,034
What an elegant man...

165
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:50,812
I deeply regret that I cannot see him
up close with my very own eyes.

166
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,609
I guess one could say that everybody
has their own set of woes.

167
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,686
Listen, make sure that
he takes a liking to me no matter what!

168
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,617
Stop complaining and get the ball rolling
with dogged persistence!

169
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,253
I will convey that to her.

170
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:13,000
Has you tension not eased?
Music is good for relaxation.

171
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:17,339
Please, you need not go to the trouble...

172
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:20,846
- What did she say?
- She said there's no mistake.

173
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,481
She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!

174
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:25,275
I can't believe it!

175
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:27,078
It's our mission, you know!

176
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,383
I know that...

177
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,956
Princess Fuku... do you like roses?

178
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,357
Yes... very much so...

179
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:40,256
Great!
I love roses too!

180
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,400
In the language of flowers,
they signify love!

181
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:47,697
But don't their meanings
differ depending on their color?

182
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,868
For example, yellow roses are
supposed to mean " Let's break up...

183
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:54,171
It's nonsense to discriminate
because of color...

184
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:59,345
I mean the flowers
are not at fault, after all.

185
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,073
For you.

186
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,873
Hey... wait!

187
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,653
Huh?

188
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,284
I can't do it! I can't do it!

189
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,325
There's no way!
He's too intense.

190
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,919
There's no way I can act as
a substitute for the princess!

191
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,257
Calm down.
Stop saying that and do your best.

192
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,094
Nope.
I just can't stand him physically.

193
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:51,970
Oh, I got it.

194
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:53,071
If you just think of him

195
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,039
- as a somewhat intense Choji...
- Choji has fat on him

196
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,699
for the sake of his Ninjutsu...

197
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,035
I don't have the slightest idea
what purpose that prince's fat serves.

198
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:02,910
That's a pretty severe opinion,
you know...

199
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:05,010
I'm going off somewhere for a moment.

200
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:07,677
Huh? Hey, where are you going?!

201
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,652
Gimme a break, that girl's a handful...

202
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,382
Well, this is for the sake of
a mission after all.

203
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:18,694
I guess it's about time for Naruto
to lend a helping hand!

204
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,092
What is it?!

205
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:29,205
I'm not judging you, but I think you
should pass on that young prince.

206
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,903
There's something wrong with his head.
I'm positive!

207
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,875
What are you saying?
He's a passionate and wonderful man!

208
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:39,084
But...

209
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:42,078
I hired the Leaf to
provide me with substitute for

210
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,384
the arranged courtship
and bring it to success.

211
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,721
You're a professional Shinobi, right?

212
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,392
So I suggest you get on it
and get the job done!

213
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:54,062
The atmosphere in there
hasn't been very congenial at all!

214
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,233
You need to be aggressive
in making yourself appealing to him!

215
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,400
<i>I'm sorry to have</i>
<i>kept you waiting, Chikara!</i>

216
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,564
That's right!
Just like that... huh?

217
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:03,809
That jerk...!

218
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,043
H Hey!

219
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:09,312
P-P-Princess?

220
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:18,187
Master Chikara... Could you loosen
my sash for me, please?

221
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,253
But... but...

222
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:23,984
Please.

223
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:25,257
Oh my gosh!

224
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:28,627
There's a creepy crawler up here
under the roof that looks like a sow bug!

225
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,526
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

226
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,440
A creepy -crawler
that looks like a sow bug?

227
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:37,943
An insect?

228
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,575
Oh... she vanished...

229
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,338
What the heck are you thinking?!

230
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:44,415
Where is the princess?

231
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,450
I don't know.

232
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:46,885
She vanished...

233
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,911
What is going on anyway?

234
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:53,782
This is starting to irritate me...
I can't get what's happening from here.

235
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:57,793
Why are you meddling!
I was just one step away!

236
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,959
What do you think you're doing,
dressed up like Princess Fuku?!

237
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,290
I'm telling you!

238
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,166
In one of Pervy Sage's books
happened to glance at,

239
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:07,330
this is the kind of thing that worked.

240
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:10,539
I don't believe that anyone would
use such a garish advance!

241
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:13,578
That's dirty!

242
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,408
There's absolutely no way
a type of guy like you

243
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,506
would ever be mistaken for
the protagonist of a boy's comic!

244
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:22,050
Huh! I was doing a way better job
than you were!

245
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:26,191
Gimme a break...

246
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,792
<i>Now that things have come to this,</i>

247
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,954
<i>I need to take care of business</i>
<i>before another meddler gets in the way!</i>

248
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:35,663
Huh... You gotta be kidding...

249
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:40,232
It looks like my help is needed
if this mission is going to be a success.

250
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,809
Princess...
where in the world have you been?

251
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:51,349
Please forgive me. I was so nervous
I just flew into a panic earlier on...

252
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,410
You really seemed like
a totally different person.

253
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,318
I'm so sorry.

254
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:01,854
You were such a wonderful person,
that it became almost unbearable...

255
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:04,718
Non. That is bad.

256
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:07,024
We must change
the air in here then.

257
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,529
Oh, in that case, I will...

258
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,662
Hi... Chikara!

259
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:15,098
Huh?

260
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,981
That just now,
outside the sliding paper door...

261
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,539
What's the matter?

262
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,512
There was one more... princess!

263
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,184
That can't be... Impossible.

264
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,059
INNERINO
<i>Naruto...!</i>

265
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:40,162
But I'm very moved that
you have such deep feelings for me

266
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,597
that you actually saw a vision...

267
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,500
Vision? No, I definitely saw...

268
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,969
You mustn't look!

269
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,572
P-Princess?

270
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,941
<i>Damn...I did that without thinking...</i>

271
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:57,707
Oh goodness me...

272
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:01,910
In my ardent desire for
you to look just at me, I...

273
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,781
What intense passion...

274
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:08,258
All right...
As you wish, princess.

275
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,595
- Huh?
- Allow me to catch

276
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:13,460
those hot feelings in fine style!

277
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,232
<i>Could this be...?</i>

278
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,825
Come, don't hold back.

279
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,063
<i>Huh?!</i>

280
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,841
You may not kiss him!
No kisses!

281
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:30,882
Oh!

282
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:35,076
Goodness, you cannot
be too careful these days!

283
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:38,022
Who told you that you could
go as far as kissing him?!

284
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,182
Oh, it's not that I wanted to...

285
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,121
I'd have to say that
you actually came to my rescue.

286
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:43,923
Don't bandy words with me!

287
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:48,060
Listen carefully, holding hands is
as much as I can concede to you...!

288
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,632
You're too loud!

289
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,936
The princess vanished again.

290
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,403
- Princess!
- Princess!

291
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,103
This isn't good!
I better hurry back.

292
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,434
Don't try anything funny in there!

293
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:04,742
I know that! In any case, we can't let him
see the two of us together!

294
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:06,912
Hurry back to your room, Princess!

295
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,145
All right.

296
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,584
Gimme a break that Ino...

297
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:20,094
Dumping me in the lake like that.
Thanks to her I'm freezing!

298
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,234
This is bad! I gotta pee...
Gotta go!

299
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,299
I don't know where
the toilet is around here.

300
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:32,009
There's nobody around...
Well, it is an emergency situation after all.

301
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,048
Huh?!

302
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,747
W W What the heck do you think
you're doing over there looking like me?!

303
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:43,387
No... this is... um...

304
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,086
How shameless!
Stop that immediately!

305
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:47,125
I can't stop it...

306
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,989
Do you not understand that
I'm telling you to stop!

307
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,760
It's impossible to stop so sudden!

308
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,201
Hey!

309
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,307
Wait up!

310
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:11,174
I wasn't quite
emotionally prepared earlier on...

311
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:15,119
However, the feelings I have
for you in my heart are true.

312
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,488
Princess...

313
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,713
Master Chikara...

314
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,484
I have harbored a secret love for you
for a long time.

315
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,958
Please, take me...

316
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:26,831
Huh?

317
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,567
- I wonder what that sound is?
- I have no idea...

318
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,807
Rain?

319
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:41,711
What a beautiful rainbow...

320
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:43,873
Stop, I say!

321
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,415
I told you, it's impossible!

322
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,292
Ouch!

323
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:55,918
Princess?!

324
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,521
Naruto!

325
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,697
You idiot!

326
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,525
Forgive me for this one, please!

327
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:06,136
I won't forgive you!

328
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:09,173
Look what you've done!

329
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,208
Ouch... Stop!

330
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,106
What in the world is going on?!

331
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:15,403
Oh no!...
Umm... this is, well...

332
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:20,079
All right, that's enough...
We can't fake it any longer.

333
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:27,250
I apologize for having hoodwinked you.
I am... the bona fide Fuku.

334
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,719
You mean to say that
the princess up to now was an imposter?

335
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,658
That is correct.

336
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:36,092
What is the meaning of all this?

337
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:40,469
I wouldn't have imagined that
things would come to such a finale!

338
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,473
No, that's not correct, Master Chikara!

339
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:43,975
Out of my way!

340
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:50,776
The super body I fantasized about
in my dreams! My ideal personified!

341
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,110
Bravo!

342
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,351
- Huh?
- Huh?

343
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,892
My cute princess. Please marry me!

344
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,425
I'm delighted, Master Chikara!

345
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,266
Hail the future wife!

346
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,573
What is this anyway...?

347
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,542
Somehow it seems like our mission
turned out to be success in the end...

348
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,846
I think?

349
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:26,951
Could it be? I put all my efforts
in making advances on a guy

350
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,647
who's not my type in the least
and got rejected.

351
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:33,851
Moreover,
it was a totally wasted effort...

352
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,017
Is that what happened?

353
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:42,264
But, everything turned out well.
So isn't it okay?

354
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,432
And both of them look so happy together...

355
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,130
That's not the problem!
A damsel's heart has been wounded...

356
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:53,040
I can't believe that, of all things,
I was brushed off by a guy like that...

357
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,909
He didn't even glance in your direction
at the end there.

358
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,341
Stop it! Don't remind me.

359
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:01,752
You can never knows
what a person likes, can you?

360
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,381
Nope...
there's no way I'll acknowledgerthat!

361
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:08,659
A man's got to like a slender girl better!

362
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,158
In order to become
even more of a woman,

363
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,197
I'm going on a diet! On a diet!

364
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,155
Wait... wait up!

365
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:44,093
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

366
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,596
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

367
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:51,102
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

368
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,232
<i>Suggestively</i>

369
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:59,039
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

370
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:05,649
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

371
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:12,213
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

372
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,250
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

373
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:22,426
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

374
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:55,566
Naruto, let's make some
bittersweet memories of youth together!

375
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,602
- Huh?
- No need to be shy.

376
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,399
I am ready both in mind and body!

377
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,962
What are you blabbing about
all of a sudden?!

378
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,007
It was long...

379
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,372
To think how much
I've waited for this moment!

380
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,742
I have no idea what you're talking about!

381
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:11,840
Here I come Naruto!
Please become my first.

382
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:12,884
Just a minute.

383
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,185
Next Time: "Viva Dojo Challenge!
Youth is all about Passion!"
