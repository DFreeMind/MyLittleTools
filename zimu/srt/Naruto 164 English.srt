1
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,838
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:26,648
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,880
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,486
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:46,404
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:55,775
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:06,556
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:16,033
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:21,163
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,331
<i>Too Late for Help</i>

12
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:53,299
You guys did good work.
Komei has confessed.

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000
It seems he plotted
the Cursed Warrior...

14
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:01,479
to mislead the public and
to take the feudal lord position.

15
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,148
Is that what Komei said?

16
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:07,419
Yes. It turned out to be
such a trifle.

17
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:09,817
The Cursed Warrior vanishing

18
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,880
was a soldier disguising himself
as the Warrior

19
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:16,952
using a strong nitrohydrochloric acid
to melt his own flesh.

20
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,940
<i>It's empty again.</i>

21
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:34,872
With this, the Cursed Warrior
incident is resolved.

22
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,048
Now the Land of Birds
should return

23
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,676
to the beautiful and
quiet land it used to be.

24
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,548
Just a minute!

25
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,549
But the Cursed Warrior still isn't...!

26
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:44,555
Don't bother.

27
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,780
But...!

28
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,592
Now you are relieved
of your duty.

29
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:51,728
Have a safe journey back
to your village...

30
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,367
Why?!

31
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,103
You said the one we saw first

32
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:06,577
and the one last night
were different, right?

33
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:09,739
Perhaps there were multiple people
disguised as the Cursed Warrior,

34
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,943
not just one alone.

35
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,286
If there was a person
inside disguised,

36
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:16,686
then how do you explain
the Warrior flying

37
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,050
As long as our mission has
been ordered complete,

38
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,060
there's no reason to continue
the mission in this land now.

39
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,560
Besides, Komei confessed
to the crime, right?

40
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,428
But, it's suspicious!

41
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,704
I can't go along with it
if I don't get the whole story!

42
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,064
This land has
its own circumstances.

43
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:37,104
Getting too involved
will cause trouble.

44
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:38,972
Humph!

45
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,042
Then I'll just have to do it
my way.

46
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,077
Hold it.

47
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,881
I'm the leader of this team.

48
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,014
So what?!

49
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,954
You look into the movements
of the Cursed Warrior once more.

50
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,822
Tenten and I will reinvestigate
this incident from a different angle.

51
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:58,625
What? But the mission's over...

52
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,490
You have a point
with what you said.

53
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,794
Everything is moving abong
too swimmingly.

54
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,602
All right! Leave it to me.

55
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:10,132
Huh?

56
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,907
Where are you going, Naruto?

57
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,344
Isn't it obvious?
To investigate the Cursed Warrior!

58
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,173
What?

59
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,110
Oh, Chishima.

60
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,645
Um, Naruto just now...

61
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:26,448
It's nothing, it's nothing.

62
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:28,257
Did you have business
with us?

63
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,858
Oh, yes.

64
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:35,158
You have all been so helpful
to me the whole time...

65
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:39,628
I feel so bad about
that low payment...

66
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,538
Additional money?

67
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,606
We couldn't...

68
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,175
No, it's the specialty of
the Land of Birds,

69
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,803
chicken wing buns filled
with bean jam.

70
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:58,385
Yakitori Tsurucho

71
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:09,731
Thanks!

72
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,886
Sure enough,
this area's fishy, believe it.

73
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,862
<i>It's kind of time consuming</i>
<i>searching alone...</i>

74
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,732
Summoning Jutsu!

75
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:54,376
Ahh, long time no see.
Are you giving me a snack?

76
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,579
Why is it you guys?!

77
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,243
Dad's busy with stuff, so.

78
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,351
No, I can't have Boss Gama
appearing, either...

79
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,416
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

80
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,190
You guys have a better sense
of smell than humans, right?

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,920
You're calling us puppies?!

82
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:15,858
Geez! Toad authority
has sure hit rock bottom!

83
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,698
Gamatatsu, we're leaving!

84
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,764
Gamatatsu?

85
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:24,035
Hey, Gamatatsu!

86
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,779
A frog that pounces on
a willow leaf?

87
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:31,879
What're you doing, you idiot?!

88
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:34,049
Big Brother Gamakichi...

89
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:37,214
I wonder what... this is?

90
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:43,493
Whoa, it's dark.
It's night.

91
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,063
Good night.

92
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:53,368
Good morning.

93
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,063
What's this?

94
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,901
It's a kite painted black.

95
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,343
A kite?

96
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,039
Look up there!

97
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,307
That's a totally huge kite,
believe it.

98
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,486
I wonder if there was
a big kite flying festival or something.

99
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:13,057
It's rather plain for
a festival kite...

100
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,319
What?! What does that mean?

101
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:16,927
Oh no!

102
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,463
Hey! Where are you going

103
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm back.

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,848
<i>I get it... If one were to fly that</i>
<i>in the cover of a dark night...</i>

105
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:40,312
<i>A Cursed Warrior hanging</i>
<i>onto the black kite</i>

106
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,081
<i>would look like he was flying...</i>

107
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:46,250
With this, the mystery of
the flying warrior is solved, believe it!

108
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,485
Next...

109
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,325
Someone was here
on that night...

110
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,298
What is it?

111
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:09,447
The Cursed Warrior came out
from here.

112
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,553
It just looks like an old temple
that isn't used much at all.

113
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,822
You're right.

114
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,524
Let's go, Gamatatsu!

115
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:27,927
But Big Brother Gamakichi,
it's nice and cool here.

116
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:31,567
What're you talking about?!
In such a hot and humid temple...

117
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,442
Indeed, that's a nice damp wind.

118
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,348
See? Isn't it comfortable?

119
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,777
Draft from down below here?

120
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:57,756
What's this?

121
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,793
Wow! I wonder if
a giant worm made this.

122
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:06,530
Or a mole?

123
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,634
All right, let's check it out.

124
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,708
I wonder how we should greet
a mole if we were to meet one.

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,908
Like I care!

126
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:23,347
So Naruto is still investigating
the Cursed Warrior, huh?

127
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,654
I should probably inform Lord Moso.

128
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:34,295
There was some trouble caused,

129
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,799
but we have at last found
a safe refuge.

130
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,222
After him!

131
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:11,464
Big Brother, where are we?

132
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,634
Huh?! This place is...

133
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:17,973
This is the residence of
the feudal lord, isn't it?

134
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,609
Really? Residence of
the feudal lord?

135
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,075
No wonder
it's an impressive building.

136
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,878
It was connected to this place?

137
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,022
What was that sound?

138
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,031
Oh! What a nice view.

139
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,330
Hey! What are you doing

140
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:48,835
Shh! Keep quiet!
We'll be discovered.

141
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,135
Big Brother Gamakichi!

142
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,211
Uh, oh!

143
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,671
You blockhead!

144
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:04,817
Uh, umm...
Good work with your duties!

145
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,888
As for me,
I'm not anyone suspicious!

146
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,958
I was asked by
the Superintendent Moso and

147
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:15,364
I'm investigating the incident...

148
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,962
It'll make sense if
I tell you about it!

149
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,673
Oww!

150
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:25,239
Lord Sagi! We have captured
a suspicious man.

151
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:26,936
What shall we do with him?

152
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:31,178
What...? Oh!

153
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:34,978
Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey!
We met at the lake, didn't we?

154
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,881
Explain to them about me!

155
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,222
I know no such person.

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,952
What?!

157
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,422
He's not worth sending
to the magistrate's office.

158
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:47,827
Lock him in the dungeon.

159
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,423
Yes, my lord!

160
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:53,168
Hey, that's harsh! Come on, Sagi!

161
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:58,538
Hey! Wait a minute!
Come on, hey!

162
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:59,600
Come on.
This is a misunderstanding!

163
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:02,266
I was just going after
the Cursed Warrior!

164
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:06,072
Umm, everything will make sense
if you just ask Mr. Moso.

165
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,803
You okay?

166
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:11,010
Yo!

167
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:15,244
I can't be fighting the soldiers
of my employer's land.

168
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:20,156
Geez. You had to go and
get caught in that trap!

169
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:26,122
Well, it's cool. I can get out
of a place like this right away

170
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,597
if I just use both my hands.

171
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,297
Hey, untie this.

172
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,993
Right. Just a second.

173
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:35,898
Wha?!

174
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:05,496
Th The Cursed Warrior...?!

175
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,473
Damn it!

176
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,951
If I could just use both hands,
this guy would be...!

177
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,718
Big Brother,
are we going to let things be?

178
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,856
If things go wrong,
we'd be sliced in two.

179
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,050
I wouldn't want that.

180
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,307
<i>Just a little more...</i>

181
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>Just a little more...!</i>

182
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:33,715
Sagi?!

183
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:38,586
What's going on here?

184
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,526
You're the other Cursed Warrior?

185
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,527
But, why?

186
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:50,167
They say people become disembodied
spirits and avenge themselves...

187
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,002
But that's a lie!

188
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,801
This watch has been handed down
from generation to generation

189
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:00,003
in the feudal lord family.

190
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,175
It was supposed to be passed
from father to son...

191
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,752
But now along with that death,
the watch has stopped ticking away.

192
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:18,790
It must have been very sad...

193
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,998
I am shamelessly living on
only for the sake of revenge!

194
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,911
I can go to hell if
I can just complete my revenge!

195
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,241
That's no good!

196
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,551
There is no way you could understand

197
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,415
how someone who has had everything
taken away from them feels!

198
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,214
Like I know about stuff like that!

199
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:51,123
But I, at least, know that living for
the sake of revenge is wrong!

200
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,226
You're a feudal lord, aren't you?

201
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,635
Is revenge the job
of a feudal lord?

202
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:01,905
You know that's not it.

203
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,607
The true culprit Komei
has been arrested.

204
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:12,109
You should just leave
the rest to Moso. Okay?

205
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,882
It is no concern of yours...

206
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,523
I must not let you live

207
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:28,396
now that you have
learned everything!

208
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,530
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord...

209
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,697
your fate is a death sentence!

210
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,807
No way...!

211
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:42,546
This is creepy...

212
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,845
This is the tomb of the successive
generations of feudal lords, right?

213
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:46,843
Yeah.

214
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,846
That's the tomb of the Lord Owashi...

215
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,390
<i>Byakugan!</i>

216
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:06,601
What's this?

217
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:11,842
What is it, Neji?
What are you seeing?!

218
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,812
There's something poisonous
in Owashi's body.

219
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,852
Was he assassinated...?!

220
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,395
We're surrounded.

221
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,975
An announcement to
the Ninja from the Leaf Village.

222
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:50,242
A message has just
now been delivered

223
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,249
from the residence of
the feudal lord!

224
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,379
Your comrade has been arrested
for infiltrating...

225
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:57,581
the residence of the feudal lord...

226
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,556
and his death sentence
has been determined!

227
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:04,061
Leave the Land of Birds at once!

228
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:09,700
If you don't, you will be executed here
for the same crime.

229
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,703
It doesn't matter!
Draw your bows!

230
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,445
Neji, what should we do?

231
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,012
Let's go to the residence
of the feudal lord.

232
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,547
We're going to save Naruto!

233
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,631
You're...

234
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,798
Kakashi Sensei!
Naruto's in trouble!

235
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,532
We have to go to the residence
of the feudal lord immediately

236
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:49,699
and save him...

237
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:50,997
We can't do that.

238
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,640
Your mission is over.

239
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:56,744
But!

240
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,816
Don't do anything other
than the mission.

241
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:41,753
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

242
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:53,330
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

243
00:21:54,072 --> 00:22:04,641
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

244
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

245
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:28,270
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

246
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:39,816
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

247
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:45,580
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

248
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,494
Are we really going back
to the village like this?

249
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:57,395
I told you. Our mission in
the Land of Birds is finished now.

250
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,766
But then, what I'll happen
to Naruto?

251
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,897
We can't interfere with
this land's internal affairs.

252
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:02,962
No way...

253
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:06,809
Sorry. The responsibility rests
on me, the leader.

254
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:11,739
Let it go... Sacrifice is
a part of Shinobi missions.

255
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,976
Next time: "The Death of Naruto"
