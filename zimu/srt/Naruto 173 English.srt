1
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:21,705
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:26,514
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,146
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:31,747
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,353
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:46,270
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:55,641
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,616 --> 00:01:06,423
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:15,900
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:21,030
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:49,294
<i>Battle at Sea.</i>
<i>The Power Unleashed!!</i>

12
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,640
So you're a monster too!

13
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,942
You're one to be acting
you are above me!

14
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,178
Take this!

15
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,382
What?!

16
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:16,524
Crap!

17
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:53,657
This is bad!

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,762
Naruto!

19
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,125
<i>I'm counting on you...</i>

20
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,810
Naruto! Hang in there.

21
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,383
Naruto!

22
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:22,851
I I'm okay...

23
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,128
Isaribi... Thank you.

24
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:38,672
Oh no!

25
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:40,472
I'll take the rest of your Chakra!

26
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,912
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

27
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,110
Impossible!

28
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,753
Made it in time...

29
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:55,389
What?!

30
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,122
I see... It was you, huh?!

31
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,502
The nerve of you to mess with me!

32
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,295
Stop it, get away!

33
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,349
Don't turn your back to the enemy!

34
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,217
You forgot the ironclad rule
of the fight...

35
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,382
You lose!

36
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:33,329
You saved me...

37
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,398
<i>That brat hit me with all his strength...</i>

38
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:44,703
<i>And that Yoroi is no good either.</i>

39
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,150
I caught a huge fish!

40
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,385
You mean you're going
to escape alone?

41
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:14,301
We completed accommodating
all the injured soldiers.

42
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,070
Good work!

43
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:18,970
What's left is...

44
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,911
Naruto and others, right?

45
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,149
Of your numerous crimes...

46
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,888
When we return to the village
justice will be served,

47
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,121
and it won't be quick,
so prepare yourself.

48
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,096
It's not over yet...

49
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:43,094
You! I haven't hit you enough yet!

50
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,266
That's too bad.

51
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,472
What?!

52
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,944
What... What's going on?

53
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:08,625
The Sea Monster doesn't die.
It is immortal, that one!

54
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,795
For the Sea Monster,
this limitless seawater is its life...

55
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,771
In the end, it will be your loss!

56
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,303
Shut up!

57
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,173
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

58
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,398
All right! I'm counting on you, Chief.

59
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,799
Go clobber that flabby guy!

60
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,203
Hey, Chief! We don't have time
for you to be so leisurely!

61
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,836
That monster...
Whack him in one go...

62
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,475
That's hot! Hot, hot!

63
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:15,354
You got no business getting
so motivated all by yourself!

64
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,767
It itches, itches and
I'm getting a rash all over my body!

65
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,436
Wait, wait.
Don't come over here, Naruto!

66
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,696
Damn him...

67
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,503
I'm going to rip you apart
when the mission is over!

68
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:31,935
Remember that!

69
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:35,909
Naruto! How are you going
to settle this?!

70
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:39,582
How can you say that,
Chief Toad is the strongest frog!

71
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,246
Please don't let something like
the saltwater bother you and fight.

72
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,656
Humph! You can't even control
the summoned animal you called up!

73
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,193
What was that?!

74
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,292
If you don't send him home quickly

75
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:55,664
the Sea Monster will gulp him down
and he'll whither like a slug!

76
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:58,363
A slug, he says?!

77
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:01,830
Hey, Naruto! I'm going to
kick your butt later...

78
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,507
Right now, I'll help you.

79
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,905
Huh? F-For real?!

80
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,671
Don't mess with amphibians...

81
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,408
I'll show you my terror!

82
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,550
Yeah! Now you're talking.

83
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,516
Hang on!

84
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:21,691
Wh What the...?

85
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:24,887
You rat... Let go of me, huh!

86
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,128
What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!

87
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:30,024
You be quiet!

88
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,035
Upsy!

89
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,808
This isn't accomplishing anything...

90
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,921
What's up with
that flabby bastard, really?

91
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,088
In short, this is some kind of monster

92
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,063
consisting of water gathered around
its spiritual body at the core.

93
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,797
Crap!

94
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,356
I don't really know what that means,

95
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,732
but I guess I can't do anything
about that thing.

96
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,964
Even though we pierce the monster
with a dagger all we want,

97
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:08,802
the monster will suck up ocean water
and come back to life...

98
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,372
Then what should we do,
Chief Toad?!

99
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,340
The only thing we can do here is

100
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,347
to somehow damage
the spiritual body at the " core.

101
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,177
Damage...? How?

102
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,644
The opponent is a clump of water...

103
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,756
Add heat and he'll evaporate!

104
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,289
The thoughts of fools mean nothing...

105
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,663
The only thing you can do is to
surrender to me, I who control the ocean!

106
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:44,306
Damn. You're annoying.
Let's go, Naruto!

107
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:46,470
What? Go? Where are you going?!

108
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,137
Airhead! I'll spew oil!

109
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:50,907
Huh?

110
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,081
Light a fire with
a Fire Style Jutsu!

111
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,626
What?! I can't do
a Fire Style Jutsu!

112
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,128
Here we go!

113
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:07,265
What? Fire, fire, fire!

114
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:13,934
How's that?!

115
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:22,808
What?!

116
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,944
H-He did it...!

117
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:28,685
Well done!

118
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:30,953
Naruto...

119
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,556
Im... Impossible!

120
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,517
We did it, Chief Toad!

121
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:37,895
How's that!

122
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:42,227
Chief Toad and me is
the strongest combination, after all!

123
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:45,401
Naruto! You're in a festive mood
all by yourself,

124
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:47,962
though I'm wondering if
you've forgotten about something?

125
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,072
Huh? Forgotten what?

126
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:53,470
You called me to a place like this...

127
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,680
Look, now I've got all of
these goose bumps!

128
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,812
You've always had all those warts...

129
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:04,546
Shut up! I'll have you
settle this properly!

130
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:07,716
What?! Wha?
W Wait Chief Toad! Wait!

131
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,125
No use talking!

132
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,170
It itches. I can't take it!

133
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:22,637
Something like this doesn't
soothe my feelings but,

134
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,644
my sons have caused you inconvenience,
so I forgive you this time.

135
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,542
See you!

136
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:38,385
I'm sorry, Chief Toad... Help me...

137
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:53,269
Now that we also got rid of
the Sea Monster, Amachi...

138
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,501
You'll be taken to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

139
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,475
as the principle offender of
the attacks on ships collecting funds.

140
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:03,008
Shame! We had got kicked
around because of you!

141
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,817
What are you doing?!
Isaribi, kill these guys!

142
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:12,883
I won't!

143
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,451
Have you forgotten?

144
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,861
I am the only person who
can turn you back into a human!

145
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:19,223
If I continue doing this,

146
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,766
I'll be a monster all the way
to my heart!

147
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,799
That's right, Isaribi!

148
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,943
You're neither a human being
nor fully integrated like me.

149
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,682
The best you can do is to live
the rest of your life as a monster

150
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,012
for your whole life!

151
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,120
Well, from the very start,

152
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,453
I hadn't thought of a way
to turn you back into a human!

153
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:48,493
Like I told you...

154
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:52,898
I was intending to dissect you!

155
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,130
No way...

156
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,897
You!

157
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,361
How rotten are you?!

158
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,064
Stop it.

159
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:07,140
Once we've returned to
the village, he'll be punished harshly.

160
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,213
Well... It's about time you told us.

161
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,060
Where... did Orochimaru go?

162
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,397
You think I know something
like that?!

163
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,403
You were tossed aside
by Orochimaru.

164
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,337
It serves you right to follow
after him forever.

165
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,536
You and I are different!

166
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,773
I'll be in charge of the research center

167
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:43,371
and some day, will become an entity
that'd bring Orochimaru to shame.

168
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,047
Really...

169
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,619
Just for yourself. Not fair!

170
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:58,489
And now, mission completed.
Let's return to the island!

171
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,159
Not fair. I'm also slug
a good one before that.

172
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:01,858
Stop it!

173
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,809
<i>That's the Jiro Island</i>
<i>Amachi was talking about...</i>

174
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,886
<i>Here is the source of my nightmare...</i>

175
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,961
<i>This place is where the fragments</i>
<i>of my missing memories is left.</i>

176
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,232
Master Orochimaru...
What in the world did you...?

177
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,269
She's alive...!

178
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,573
She's a lucky girl...

179
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:36,643
After we tested ten,
only one survived...

180
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,318
I guess this experiment yielded
little something before I take my leave.

181
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,260
Leave?

182
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:47,927
Because it looks like
there's no reason to be here anymore...

183
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,660
But, the research is still...

184
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:56,274
That facility, do with it
whatever you want.

185
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,240
I have no need for it anymore...

186
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:06,684
- Why...? How could you do this?
- Why...? How could you do this?

187
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,578
- I always respected you, yet you...
- I always respected you, yet you...

188
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,092
You're lacking many things.

189
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,498
Motivation to desire the "power"...

190
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:26,226
Tenacity...

191
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,434
Hatred...

192
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,342
Everything!

193
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,447
But, let's see...

194
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,788
I suppose just the fact
that you survived

195
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,518
might mean you have some value...

196
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:52,757
Say? Do you want to come with me...?

197
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:22,225
I see...

198
00:18:24,663 --> 00:18:27,791
I'll find a better gifted child then...

199
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:46,677
It connected...

200
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:58,492
So bright...

201
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,367
<i>I wasn't cast aside...</i>

202
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:06,535
<i>I, on my own...</i>

203
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,471
<i>by my own will... chose it!</i>

204
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:20,514
Hey, hey, where did Sensei go?

205
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,820
When I woke up this morning
she wasn't here...

206
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:25,452
Will be right back!
Anko
Leaving behind only
a note like this!

207
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:28,852
Seriously...
She sure is a fidgety person!

208
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:31,219
What did you say?
Who do you think you are?

209
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,627
Whaddya mean?!

210
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:33,924
What, you object?!

211
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,325
Um...

212
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,471
Really... Can I come with you?

213
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:43,506
Don't worry!

214
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:45,036
There's a very scary,

215
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,568
but awesome Medical Ninja
in Village Hidden in the Leaves!

216
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:52,845
Yes, because Lady Tsunade
is a medical specialist.

217
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,611
That's right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!

218
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,548
Surely she'll do something for you!

219
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:00,551
Relax and let us take care of it.

220
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:02,961
Thank you.

221
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,721
Hey, all of you!

222
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,697
What are you doing?!
The boat will leave!

223
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:12,328
When did you...!

224
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,333
What were you doing?!

225
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,465
We've been waiting for you
this whole time, Sensei.

226
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,572
Sorry, sorry...

227
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,848
Wait! We're getting on!

228
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:37,124
Okay! We're going home
to the Leaf Village!

229
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:41,762
No doubt, you are hyper
from the start to the finish...

230
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,135
Do you know what being tired is?

231
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,300
Any problem?

232
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:49,332
I'm praising you! I appreciate it!

233
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:53,643
Huh? Really?
You're embarrassing me.

234
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,217
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

235
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,018
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

236
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,624
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

237
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,627
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

238
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,689
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

239
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,267
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

240
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,527
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

241
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,403
<i>The images.</i>

242
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:02,413
<i>It probably will not end</i>

243
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,809
<i>It probably will not end</i>

244
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,658
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

245
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,684
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

246
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,729
<i>Running freely</i>

247
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,359
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

248
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,460
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

249
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:29,439
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

250
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:36,044
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

251
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,316
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

252
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

253
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,154
Guarding a high profile individual.

254
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,391
Sure has a nice ring to it, believe it!

255
00:22:57,135 --> 00:23:00,229
Yeah! A mission has finally come
that suits my ability!

256
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,029
Just you wait,
you great heir to a fortune!

257
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:05,540
Now that I've taken this on,
I'll go through fire or water or...!

258
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,634
Hey, what's this?!

259
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:10,678
Isn't this just a D rank mission
with babysitting?

260
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:16,250
Next time: "Impossible!
Celebrity Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!"
