1
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,703
An Assassin in the Moonlight

2
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:57,096
This guy..

3
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:03,684
Sasuke-kun..

4
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,986
We were a bit too late it seems..

5
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,031
They are..

6
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,264
Sa.. Sakura-chan..

7
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,685
You two..

8
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,013
Th.. this is..

9
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:33,965
He must've fought out of control..

10
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:36,918
..like that time.

11
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,304
Sasuke-kun!

12
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:45,250
But Kakashi-sensei said the mark was taken care of..

13
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,499
Who is that..

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,978
Sakura-chan..

15
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,700
Sakura-chan!

16
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,849
What is it!?

17
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,482
Who.. who the hell is that?

18
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,450
Although his figure has been transformed..

19
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,417
..he's the one named Gaara.

20
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:08,203
Having this body possessed by the incarnation of sand..

21
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:16,392
..I came into this world stealing life away from a woman I would've called my mother.

22
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,620
I am a born monster.

23
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,762
So.. that thing is it?

24
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:26,848
He.. attacked Sasuke-kun..

25
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,175
Hey Missy!

26
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:32,213
I feel that I should tell you I'm not a battle-type.

27
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,237
I can tell!

28
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,502
Anyway, we have to somehow lose them..

29
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:41,930
..and take Sasuke-kun to Kakashi-sensei as soon as possible.

30
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,418
You..

31
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:50,089
Sasuke-kun..

32
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:53,393
Well, your limit is at two shots..

33
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,637
it seems..

34
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,964
There would be no third one..

35
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:01,951
Never forget that.

36
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,634
When you try to strain the activation of a jutsu not only will the jutsu fail..

37
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,991
but you also lose all remaining chakra..

38
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,986
..and your life in the worst-case scenario.

39
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,280
Even if you survive..

40
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,453
You will face difficulties no matter what.

41
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,706
Especially because you have..

42
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,235
..a curse seal?

43
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,863
If you give in to hatred and depend on the power of the curse seal..

44
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,821
..that'll be it for your strength growth.

45
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,086
In that case, you can never defeat Itachi.

46
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,036
I have to control this..

47
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,326
Sasuke-kun!

48
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,340
I see..

49
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:58,666
You..

50
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:02,272
you're the one I failed to kill that time.

51
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:07,937
I fight for my sake only and I live to love no one but myself.

52
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:11,369
As long as mankind exists for me to kill..

53
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,355
my existence will never end..

54
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,536
You guys!

55
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,662
Get away!

56
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:35,043
Die! Uchiha Sasuke!

57
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,746
Sakura-chan!

58
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,273
Sakura-chan!

59
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:17,913
She held her ground against Gaara even in his current state..

60
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,570
Damn it!

61
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,636
Dammit..

62
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,581
What are we supposed to do!?

63
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,046
Anyone but him..

64
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:32,184
Come on, let me feel it..

65
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:42,992
Why?

66
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:53,172
Gaara-sama, please calm down!

67
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,634
It's no use..

68
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,228
The sand gets in the way..

69
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:15,506
Gaara-sama..

70
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:18,344
Yashamaru..

71
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:26,503
As a member of your medical team at Kazekage-sama's command, my duty is to protect you from any harm..

72
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:30,805
Please do not try to do such a thing..

73
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,769
..although the sand will protect you anyway.

74
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,715
Yashamaru, I'm sorry.

75
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,894
Oh this..

76
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:46,542
Don't worry about it.

77
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,311
Do injuries..

78
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,662
..hurt?

79
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,330
Well, a little..

80
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,301
But it's nothing serious.

81
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,408
Hey, Yashamaru..

82
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:09,239
Yes?

83
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,421
What is pain?

84
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,469
I've.. never been injured so..

85
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:21,865
I wonder what it's like..

86
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,065
How should I put it?

87
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:31,271
Afflictive.. or dreadful..

88
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,314
like when you're beaten or cut..

89
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,108
your body's in an unbearable condition in which you feel that you're unable to stay in your usual self..

90
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,182
I can't explain it very well but.. I think I can say that it's unpleasant..

91
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,713
Yashamaru..

92
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,754
Yes?

93
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:03,932
Then..

94
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,414
Yashamaru, do you..

95
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:08,945
..hate me?

96
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:25,014
In life there are times people hurt and get hurt by others..

97
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:29,404
But it's not that easy to dislike someone from such an experience.

98
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,192
Thank you, Yashamaru.

99
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,108
I think I understand what pain is..

100
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,471
Is that so..

101
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:44,926
Does that mean I am injured..

102
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,909
..just like everyone else?

103
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:50,485
Then I always.. feel pain..

104
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:52,918
Although it doesn't bleed..

105
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,797
this part hurts so much..

106
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:23,066
Bodies bleed upon physical injuries and they may look quite hurtful..

107
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:27,093
But eventually the pain will wear off as time passes..

108
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:30,081
..and they can heal faster with medical aids.

109
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,392
What's more serious are emotional scars..

110
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,010
They are the hardest to heal..

111
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:39,259
Emotional scars?

112
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,914
Physical and emotional scars are a bit different..

113
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:49,260
Unlike physical ones, there's no ointment available for emotional ones.. and pain may never go away.

114
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,442
There is only one thing that can stop such heartache.

115
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:07,349
However, as inconvenient as it may seem this cure can only be given by people other than yourself.

116
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,878
What? What is it?

117
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,970
The only thing to stop heartache..

118
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,019
is..

119
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,131
..love

120
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,917
Love?

121
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:22,082
Yes.

122
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:24,404
H.. how can I receive that?

123
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,989
What should I do to get rid of the pain?

124
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:31,056
Gaara-sama, you are already receiving it..

125
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:40,513
Love is.. care and devotion you feel for the precious ones around you..

126
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,955
Like the feeling Sister had for you..

127
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:50,168
I believe she loved you so very much.

128
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:55,835
The Sand Shuukaku is primarily a living spirit specialized in attacks.

129
00:11:56,235 --> 00:12:01,686
It's automatic perfect defense is a proof of maternal affection..

130
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:07,031
Your mother's will remained in the sand to protect you.

131
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:09,542
Sister..

132
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,586
even after death..

133
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:14,398
you wanted to be there for Gaara-sama..

134
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,619
Yashamaru..

135
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:20,469
What is it?

136
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,235
About today, thank you..

137
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,353
..for stopping me.

138
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:27,729
You're very welcome.

139
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,344
After all Gaara-sama, you're my precious one around me.

140
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,455
Can you..

141
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,386
..feel my pain?

142
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:11,577
It tastes like metal..

143
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,114
Finishing Kick!

144
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:54,811
Konoha Whirlwind!

145
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,494
Kakashi.. how many did you beat?

146
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,220
Twenty-two.

147
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:03,416
Looks like I win again.

148
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,906
That was my 23rd.

149
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,059
Yeah, yeah.. that's great.

150
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,003
That attitude of yours is hip!

151
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:15,146
That makes you a worthy rival of mine.

152
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:16,666
Let's go!

153
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:17,588
Right!

154
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,421
Hey, Yashamaru..

155
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,800
I have a favor to ask..

156
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,298
What is it?

157
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,431
I want some ointments.

158
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,755
I'm sorry about earlier..

159
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,156
it must've hurt..

160
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:59,050
Please, use this ointment..

161
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,541
Go away, you monster..

162
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,766
Watch it, you brat..

163
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,226
You.. You are..

164
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:41,269
It's..

165
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,900
Go away, monster!

166
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:44,325
those eyes again..

167
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,135
You.. You are..

168
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,864
Why..

169
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,010
Why!?

170
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,321
H.. hey..

171
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:58,392
What!

172
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,119
- What happened!?

173
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:00,683
It.. it's Gaara!

174
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,283
- H.. Hey!

175
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,008
This guy's dead..

176
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,328
Father..

177
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:34,826
I knew it..

178
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,801
It doesn't go well at all..

179
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,661
How come..

180
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,226
..only I am such a monster?

181
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,365
What.. exactly am I?

182
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:51,571
There is one thing that can stop such heartache.

183
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,440
It's love.

184
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,134
Yashamaru..

185
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,705
What..

186
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,863
Why?

187
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,878
Why me?

188
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,070
Only me!

00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:52,743
..Who?

190
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:54,852
..Why?

191
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,361
Impressive..

192
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,252
Gaara-sama..

193
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,604
Yashamaru..

194
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,546
Those eyes again..

195
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,020
What's the matter?

196
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,638
Weren't you going to retreat?

197
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:06,767
Sasuke-kun..

198
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,166
Naruto..

199
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:16,654
These guys..

200
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,919
What do they mean to you?

201
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:21,987
They..

202
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:26,694
..they are my friends!

203
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:30,302
Leave them alone, or else!

204
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:32,673
I'll kick your ass!

205
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,537
Now what?

206
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:45,175
Aren't you going to kick my ass?

207
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,464
Bring it on.

208
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:57,837
Damn you!

I understand his power.

212
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:55,022
To him, I may only be a frivolous coward..

213
00:22:56,414 --> 00:23:01,086
But what.. what is this feeling that's gushing out of me?

214
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:05,433
I don't know.. I don't know, but I..

215
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,168
..don't want to lose to this guy even if I die!
