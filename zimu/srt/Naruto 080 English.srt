At least this sword.>.

37
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,810
Even if you were a master in the art of the Shinobi,
the end also for you has arrived.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,070
I feel like if the arms they were burning.

39
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,710
Orochimaru-sama!

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,400
The plan ends here.

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,130
I do not have more need of the Kekkai (protected area)

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,480
We go ourselves some!

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360

(Free)

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,730
The Kekkai has been…

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,450
As it will be…

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,950
Hokage-sama?

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,780
We go!

49
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,450
Lascerò  not to scappare  to you!

Ninpo Kumoshibari
(Burlap of Spider)

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,350
This is one ragnatela sticky made of Chakra.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,680
Kakashi! They are muovendo. We follow them!

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,100
It does not wait for.

54
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,460
Just.

55
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,620
To move without no information on the general situation…

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,890
… it could makes you to fall in one enemy trap.

57
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,510
I know very well.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,630
But we cannot leave to escape
the enemies in one situation like this.

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,120
This is the style of the Shinobi di Konoha.

60
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,320
And you? You are only to watch?

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,180
Kabuto?

62
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,990
You had already understood that pits I eh?

63
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,430
Hey, that we must make?

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,560
We withdraw ourselves for the moment.

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,170
You are of new escaping via from me?

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,310
, for the moment.

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,790
If my techniques only showed you in order little,
you would succeed to copy them to the perfection.

68
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,430
Although it seems that you are not in degree
to use R-al.meglio your eye, contrarily to those of the Uchiha clan

69
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,160
Soon.

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Temari…

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Kankuro…

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,410
You take cure of Sakura.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,830
Hey!

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,380
How ago to being cos ì  strong?

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,200
My existence will not be cancelled.

76
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,440
It will not be cancelled.

77
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,830
I will not allow  that it is cancelled!

78
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,320
I had said to you that you did not have neanche parlargli!

79
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,900
We go ourselves some!

80
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,760
Laggiù!

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
That one is…

82
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,950
Outside from the feet!

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,490
MONSTER!

84
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,350
Monster!

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
You die!

86
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,000
Not impicciarti, stupid!

87
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,510
It does not watch to you!

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,020
Vattene from some other part!

89
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,310
I am an error of their past,
that they want to cancel!

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,940
Therefore, which it is the reason for which
I exist and are while still alive?

91
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,990
Also I thought the same things of same me…
Indeed I was forced to think it cos ì…

92
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,400
I had understood that pain does not exist peggior…

93
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,890
My presence was not appreciate
to nobody in this world.

94
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,910
Not to come here!

95
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:47,750
That pain that who tries is completely single
it is not common in this world, is not true?

96
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,440
I can understand your feelings, in some way
they are similar to the suffering that I have tried.

97
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,760
But now I have of the persons to which I hold.

98
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,790
I will not allow  that you can hurt my precious friends!

99
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,800
Otherwise, also to stop to you,
I will be forced to kill to you!

100
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,020
Why?

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,790
Why you make this for the others?

102
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,580
Why they have saved to me from the suffering of the solitudine…

103
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,430
They have given sense to my existence…

104
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,430
They are my more precious affections.

105
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,720
The love is a pure emotion, makes you protect
the precious persons whom they encircle to you.

106
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,710
Love…

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Here the reason for which he is cos ì  strong.

108
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,190
Hour enough, Naruto.

109
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,400
Sakura is to the sure one now.

110
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,560
Probably it has used all the its Chakra.

111
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,950
The sand that withheld Sakura not is more.

112
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,550
Truly…

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
We have made enough.

114
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,000
I withdraw to me

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,020
Gaara!

116
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,730
This is before the time that I see it cos ì  malridotto.

117
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,570
It goes well.

118
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,170
Uzumaki Naruto, eh.

119
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,300
A day also I…

120
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,980
Temari, Kankuro…

121
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,210
Me dispiace.

122
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,110
Not to worry to you…

123
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,190
Rain…

124
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
The sky has begun to cry…

125
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,360
We are because of the battle here,
in order to begin this leave…

126
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,730
… in honor of the Third Hokage and many other victims.

127
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,100
Begun E'.

128
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,360
After all, we can only remain to watch…

129
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,460
Why?

130
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Why it has had to die the Hokage?

131
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,130
Why?

132
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,810
At this point a year is passed nearly.

133
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,720
It is not easy to hide the own one
_ sadness and sorridere, true?

134
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,850
I have felt from teaching yours that
the always six craftsman of all the risate ones.

135
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,370
They are not sad!

136
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,230
E' an honor for one shinobi to die during the own mission.

137
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:16,540
My father and my mother are heroes who have saved this
village from the monstrous vixen, putting in game their screw!

138
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,660
They are the son of these heroes!

139
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,930
They are not sad even if they are remained alone.

140
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,030
These are joy tears…

141
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,320
Hour enough.

142
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,310
I know that tests to go ahead only with your forces.

143
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,610
But it remembers to you that not six solo.

144
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,460
All the ninja of the Leaf have "the volonta of the fire ".

145
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,130
The will of the fire?

146
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,570
E' strong desire protect Konoha.

147
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:00,060
Until to when it has this fire will,
all people of Konoha will be one family.

148
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,580
Iruka, you ce have it this determination?

149
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,670
.

150
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,520
They are for Hayate?

151
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,870
The funeral of the Third party already is begun. Sbrigati.

152
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,000
Kakashi-senpai,
six here for Obito-saint?

153
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,190
Inasmuch as you are always to invent excuses for your delays,
why you do not come before?

154
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,630
I come always all the mornings from there…

155
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,200
But I come here only for
to remember the sciocchezze to me of the past.

156
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,850
A ninja it would not have to reveal its emotions in no occasion.

157
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,520
To make that the own mission is one priority and
not to never cry for no reason.

158
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,000
Iruka-sensei?

159
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,970
Why people risk the own life for the next one?

160
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,010
The dead women of a person go beyond to how much can seem…

161
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,540
Door with if the screw of the past, the present and the future.

162
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,290
Much people die during the missions or in war…

163
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,150
Easy…

164
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,730
Hayate is one of these.

165
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,080
Also a dying person has a dream or a objective…

166
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,750
But all how many have something that joins them.

167
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,780
Parents…

168
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,270
Siblings…

169
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,990
Affections and friends…

170
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,910
The persons who you think precious.

171
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,280
The uni are helped and believed in the others…

172
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,050
They are the relations with the persons who you know sin from when six been born.

173
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:04,100
The thread that joins they to you has become
often and strongly with passing of the time.

174
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,080
Logical E' therefore…

175
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,380
… that a person whom this holds
thread is behaved in such a way…

176
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,450
… inasmuch as it is precious.

177
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,980
Also I in some way had understood I was cos ì.

178
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,980
But…

179
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,230
