tsk.. You will not go from no part!

37
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,513
Vai!

38
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,774
Not.... Impossible!

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:35,197
Episode #95
Godaime Hokage
One life sacrificed to the combat!

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,991
Rasengan

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,787
This is…

42
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,681
Naruto.... has made it…

43
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,020
This Ragazzo-Volpe, has learned that technique?

44
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,314
Incredible…

45
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,691
Just incredible!

46
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,200
In a week it is only successful to learn…

47
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,784
The Rasengan!

48
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,794
You, after to have embedded this technique…

49
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,844
Before that the ball of Chakra caught up my stomach, I had begun
to accumulate the chakra in the abdomen.

50
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,098
E' for that Orochimaru-sama has to me chosen,

51
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:12,396
Not only for my performances, or the level of my techniques, but for my ability to regeneration.

52
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:19,611
I can replace the old cells and replace them with of the new.

53
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:24,616
However, I have nearly exausted my Chakra.

54
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,286
This technique,

55
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,581
It seems to be the winning paper of Naruto-kun.

56
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,681
Che cos' is …

57
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,568
Impossible.... I have regenerated my cells…

58
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,487
but the damages are however serious…

59
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,117
I do not have more much Chakra…

60
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,384
Of you strike yourself irregular!

61
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,601
Merda, the muscles are tear to you!

62
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,520
How it has made?

63
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,147
In that moment?

64
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,946
Sezionato muscles around
to the heart before the impact with the Rasengan

65
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,080
Not to shake!

66
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,006
Ehi Gamakichi-niichan.

67
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,803
We will have truly of the food?
That boy has the air of being died.

68
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,305
Taci! You cannot remain calm!?

69
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,485
Morirà Naruto-kun.

70
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,658
The organ that transforms the chakra of Kyubi in energy…
The heart…

71
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:35,080
I have stopped the circolatorio system of the Chakra…

72
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,292
I have used my last forces…

73
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,382
in order to prevent that it was regenerated.

74
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,553
Not there is no means....  It cannot  be recovered.

75
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,181
Also for you…

76
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,307
You are zitto!

77
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,060
I will kill  you  more late.

78
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,402
It does not breathe more…

79
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,414
Merda.

80
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,208
Merda!

81
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,418
Merda!!

82
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,221
The dusk…

83
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,182
The buio.

84
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:41,813
Why stà becoming gloomy all? Why is disappearing my power in the dusk?

85
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,191
Because…

86
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,403
Che cos' is…

87
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,702
Not to die.

88
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,496
Not to die.

89
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,581
Not to die!

90
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,583
Not to die!

91
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,794
Not to die!

92
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,887
The bet…

93
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,397
I have earned…

94
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,443
Impossible!

95
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:44,918
Poichè you say that your dream is to become Hokage…

96
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,015
A last time…

97
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,101
A last time…

98
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,104
Once again…

99
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,235
I want to believe in you.

100
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,544
That child me seems put badly.

101
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,756
Tsunade is a specialist doctor.

102
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,885
Naruto will be well, not is from preoccuparsi.

103
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,221
It is not what I wanted to say.

104
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,472
That what imports…

105
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,017
E' time to end.

106
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,020
You do not have time to lose.

107
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,899
I did not expect that he became cos ì  strong…

108
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,945
If Akatsuki put the hands on that boy,
it could become a problem…

109
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,990
This wants to say that if I must kill it,
I must make now!

110
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,416
Merda!

111
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,512
It wants to hit it!

112
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,518
Tsunade, I did not have intention to hit to you.

113
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,897
But to leave this boy while still alive is one bad idea.

114
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,401
It could cause me of the troubles.

115
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,695
Not to interfere.

116
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,406
This boy…

117
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,411
Proteggero this boy!

118
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:32,419
Why a Sannin like you that it shakes
alla.vista of the blood…

119
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:38,091
it tries protect a simple one genin to the price of the life?

120
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:56,485
In order protect Konoha.... our village !

121
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,283
In order protect Konoha?

122
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:23,095
Why… Why… a boy a day will become Hokage.

123
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,517
Those inept ones.>.

124
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,688
In any case, to become Hokage, is one stronzata!

125
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,691
The imbecilli they only wish it.

126
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,113
To be Hokage, is one Stronzata.
The imbecilli they only wish it!

127
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,790
Their desires, are also yours, Tsunade-sama…

128
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,713
Your dreams, you have forgets them to you!

129
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:08,348
Old the proteggevano Hokage Konoha and the life of its inhabitants.

130
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:15,480
They put their life in game for this dream.

131
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:25,991
Even if you a six female, do not have the right to insult "old" and the Yondaime.

132
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,493
I will hit  you  with all my forces!

133
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,506
Beginning from now, also I…

134
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,717
I will put  my life in game!

135
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:51,016
Six you want to risk the life for this child....

136
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,394
then merits to die!

137
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,212
Tsunade-sama!!

138
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,508
I must make in time…

139
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,606
After that fatal blow, as  it can  still move!?

140
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,994
You want still protect this boy?

141
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,999
You I have as soon as said!

142
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,584
Beginning from now…

143
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,589
I put in game my life!

144
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,301
Then you end to crack!

145
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:25,611
Beautiful words, however still shake.

146
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,199
You do not succeed neanche to stop yours fobia.

147
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:37,206
I do not understand why you want protect this boy,

148
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,585
Because you strike yourself for Konoha…

149
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,014
Impossible!

150
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,016
It does not shake more!?

151
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,018
It has been stopped!

152
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,314
This is because now…

153
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,781
They are the Fifth Hokage di Konoha!

154
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:13,492
Qual' is this seals?

155
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,789
Tsunade-sama has sormontato its fobia? But this is…

156
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,712
Which thing you count to make, now?

157
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:33,220
I have hurt to you and you have lost much blood,
you will not be able to fight with me in this state.

158
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,228
Waited for a moment!
I  will recover them your wounds!

159
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,690
You do not open I seal, ve I pray some!
I pray to you, freed I do not seal!

160
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,611
Liberation of Sigillo!

161
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:53,407
Ninpou, Souzou Saisei

162
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:53,407
[ Regeneration ]

163
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,216
Which technique is this?

164
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:21,143
They are not the solo to have developed of the technical new…

165
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,479
Qual' is exactly this technique?

166
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,398
Well…

167
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:31,195
I have passed much time to store my Chakra.

168
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:36,116
I have used one great amount of chakra in order stimulating my cells…

169
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,078
and to increase to their speed of regeneration and division.

170
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:46,919
My muscular woven organs are able to reconstruct all and.

171
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,715
This is not only one guarigione, but one regeneration.

172
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,719
That  never means that in a combat  not  morirò.

173
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,975
But the time number that the cells can be regenerated is limited.

174
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:07,481
Who uses this technique abbrevia its life!

175
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,485
Tsunade-sama!

176
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,488
This gesture…

177
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,490
Orochimaru-sama!

178
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,994
I hope to make it us!

179
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,705
Sbrigati!

180
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:24,957

187
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,701
Ah, papà!

188
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,504

189
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,298
Ehi, Gamatatsu! We go ourselves some!

190
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,717

Not to make questions, you go via!

192
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:57,484

00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:01,405
an encounter like the old times.

194
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,122
You want to make one reunion with old friends, Jiraiya?

195
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:16,003
Idiot! E' from much time that not you invocavo, it avoids to joke?

196
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:20,632
I had thought to carry a.termine a our small transaction.

197
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:25,512
Orochimaru, today you will be defeated.

198
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,850
Ehi Orochimaru.

199
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:34,396
Not invocarmi for much annoying situzaioni.

200
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,196
Therefore, you want that it eats to you?

201
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,157
Not speeches cos ì,  Manda-sama.

202
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,950
Ringrazieremo to you later....

203
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,786
To who creeds to speak?

204
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:54,291
Not to speak to me like if you knew to me, small parasite!

205
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,588
Ehi, Orochimaru.

206
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:04,801
For the sacrifice, you will have to prepare a hundred of bodies.

207
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:14,186
Even if it is its servitore, "Sends" will betray to us
not as soon as it will have uncovered that Orochimaru not
it can  use its Jutsu.

208
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,523
In this situation.>.

209
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:21,443
to invocare Manda is extremely rischioso!

210
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:26,114
Katsuyu, you lead this boy from Shizune.

211
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,575
S ì,  I have understood.

212
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,171

Shizune-sama, I pray to take you to you cure of this boy.

214
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:49,930
Naruto-kun…

215
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,351
Also, this place will become a terrible battlefield.

216
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:59,731
You move yourselves more far away possible.

217
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:04,319
E' which wants Tsunade-sama.

218
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,030
Tsunade-sama…

219
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:28,010
Plants it, Wants that it reduces to you to pieces?

220
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:33,182
Just when I had need of a new pocketbook in snakeskin.

221
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:40,981
Orochimaru! You have made too much badly.

222
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,983
We are not more similar.

223
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:44,985
Companions?

224
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,072
It does not make me to laugh.

225
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,367
The legenda of the three Sannin will end today!

226
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,720

Tsunade-sama!

231
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,509
Merda!

232
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,273
It arrives!

233
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,524

00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,998
Bunta! of the oil!

236
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,708

00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,132

240
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,404
Creed.

241
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,119
Not, this is…

242
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,586
One skin! It has changed skin!

243
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,260
Bunta, is under!

244
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,303
Which thing?

245
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,484
Stopped!

246
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,949
As I thought, to strike itself against two Sannin at the same time is revealed difficult.

247
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,286
Tsunade!

248
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,542

250
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,297
If it continues…

251
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,384
Even if you have said that not morirai never in a combat,

252
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,347
If I strangle to you, morirai, Tsunade.

253
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:06,019
How much time I can restistere…

254
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,023
This is a bet.

255
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:19,074
Much good!  It is  time to make ended it!

256
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,287

E' this that Tsunade-sama....!

262
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,425
One would say that it has caught up its limits.

263
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,927
My God!

264
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:33,190
Always beautiful E' to hit it…

265

267
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,751
I cannot be stopped!

268
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,795
I must continue it to hit it.

269
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,889
E' mine the life that I have put in game in this combat!

270

272
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,402
It remains with me until the end!

273
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:23,740
Spece of…

274
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,720
I must hit it still and still…

275
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:48,932
Che cos' is this strange feeling?

276
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:21,006
Finally with this…

277
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,137
This is the end!

278
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,691
It has given off all this power with only a blow.

279
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,028
The combat is ended…

280
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,112
S ì…

281
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,370
Orochimaru-sama!

As dared to humiliate to me in this way.

283
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,427
I would have eaten to you gladly, but…

284
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,640
With my bucata mouth, I cannot swallow nothing.

285
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:16,353
Me you will pay to our next encounter!

286
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:54,516
Tsunade, I do not have more need than you,
poichè other means remain me…

287
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,985
in order to recover my arms.

288
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,914
Cos ì  I will come  to destroy Konoha definitively.

289
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:24,296
I would want see again to you in that occasion, companions mine.

290
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,510
Tsunade, Jiraiya.

291
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,514
This ace…

292
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:39,269
Able E' of impossessarsi of the body of an other?

293
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:45,651
That  explains because it does not seem to try the effects of the aging.

294
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,573
They are the incarnation of immortality.

I am the grandson of the first Hokage,
R-he who has founded the village of Konoha.

I do not have need to strike to me seriamnete against a child like you.

337
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,754
A finger will be sufficient.

338
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,841
This is not because they are a child who must make fun of itself of me!

339
