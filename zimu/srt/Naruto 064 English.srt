2
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:59,998
Damn, Naruto...

3
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:07,195
Envy Of The Clouds...
A Man With No Drive  

4
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,515
They are disappointed and in a bad
mood because they have to watch the...

5
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:29,076
...side-kicks' fight, instead of Sasuke's fight,
which they were looking forward to see.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,277
There’s no meaning to do this match
since nobody is looking forward to it.

7
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:38,128
What's wrong?

8
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,349
Are you going to forfeit too?

9
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,829
My opponent is a woman again?

10
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:53,291
From the start he doesn't have any drive to do anything.

11
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,966
Damn it! What's he doing?

12
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,344
Hey, Shikamaru! Do your best!

13
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,821
If you don't start things, I'm going to!

14
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,166
Hey, I didn't say the match begins...

15
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,057
Gezz... This woman is full of drive to fight.

16
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:35,181
If I can't become one, I don't need to be a Chunin...

17
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,813
...but a man shouldn't lose to a woman.

18
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:41,889
Well, I guess I'm gonna fight.

19
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,618
He's quick to run away.

20
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:09,237
A man shouldn't hit a woman with his fists...

21
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,875
...but I don't want to get beaten up by her either.

22
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:16,578
I remember that he's a Ninja who uses shadows.

23
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,594
Kagemane-no Jutsu

24
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:30,632
He wants to pull me into the woods where
shadows are everywhere, but I won't let him.

25
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:35,227
Why do only I have to fight against women. Shit!

26
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:42,028
Shikamaru! Beat that woman up with a 16-continuous hit combo!

27
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,732
May I sit next to you?

28
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:50,229
What? Did your stomach fully recover already?

29
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:51,389
Yup.

30
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,957
Potato Chips!

31
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:57,846
Huh? Wasn't the next match Sasuke's?

32
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:06,387
It's alright, isn't it Sakura?
Because it's Sasuke-kun after all...

33
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,662
I'm going to leave her alone for now.

34
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:16,481
Shikamaru being in the final round
seems to be out of place, isn't it?

35
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:21,735
Don't say that. It may be true that
he doesn't have any special skills...

36
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,863
...but Shikamaru is always good at creating battle plans.

37
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:31,197
I think that is why we survived
to the prelims of the final round.

38
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,341
Oh, yeah. That’s true.

39
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:37,167
Just a second ago, he jumped down to the arena by himself.

40
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:44,109
He seems to be excited unlike usual.
He has some part that is "hot"!

41
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,387
Go for it, Shikamaru!

42
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:55,467
Oh man. I envy the clouds... they're free.

43
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:09,656
Anyways, I have no drive. The reason why I
became Ninja is I thought I can live easily.

44
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:21,992
Be a man! Shikamaru!

45
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:29,977
But, I guess it won't be that easy.

46
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:34,011
What an idiotic face he puts on. It gets on my nerves.

47
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,870
Ninpo Kamaitachi
(Blade of Wind)

48
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:53,948
That's right. With this attack, my
weapon attacks were all shut out.

49
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,688
I see.

50
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:23,985
Kagemane no Jutsu, the secret is out.

51
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:29,938
I see that there's a limit to extend,
shorten, or change the shape of shadow.

52
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:38,094
No matter how much you change the shape or extend it,
you can only extend to the size equal to your surface area.

53
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:39,997
Isn't that true?

54
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:42,621
You're right.

55
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:50,067
Even if I assume that he extended his body shadow
from the edge of the shadow of the arena's wall...

56
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:56,869
This is the limitation for his shadow to
extend. This is the maximum reach he can attack.

57
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,581
15 meters and 32 centimeters

58
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:03,362
She calculated the distance with her fan.

59
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:09,922
She's better at long distance battles than
a close match. The result is obvious already.

60
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,669
What? What is that In (hand seal)?

61
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,510
That isn't an In. It's like his habit.

62
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,078
Habit?

63
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:52,426
He knows to enjoy how time flows slowly. He's like an old man.

64
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:58,414
He likes Igo and Shogi and he has me
as his opponent all the time. But...

65
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:07,212
...whenever he's stuck, he does that every single time.

66
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:15,255
Why?

67
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,530
He's planning a battle.

68
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,211
Therefore, I have never won against him.

69
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:36,492
A battle plan? This is true battle, not a game.

70
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:42,614
But people say that the game originated
from the real battle plan tools.

71
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,663
In other words, Shikamaru is an able military brain.

72
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:55,008
Hold on a sec. When making Genin teams, I saw his
grades and it was almost the same level as Naruto.

73
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:02,484
He said he was always sleeping during the academy's
paper exams because even moving a pencil is too tiresome.

74
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,059
Tiresome?

75
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:29,179
I didn't get it because he was so good at battle-planning games.
So, I once had him take an IQ test, saying it's just another game.

76
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,642
And, what was the result?

77
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:47,576
The best of the best. He is a super genius with an IQ of 200.

78
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:50,715
200?

79
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:01,655
He's done thinking. It begins from now.

80
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,414
I can see you're a little bit motivated now.

81
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,578
There's no use hiding.

82
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:37,691
I wonder if he actually has a battle plan.

83
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:40,181
Probably...

84
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:53,111
He can't get any closer with that. Shikamaru, Do your best!

85
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:58,873
I think it's useless. He's going to give up soon.
He's one who thinks everything is troublesome.

86
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:05,489
He won't... I believe he won't... or not...

87
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,296
How long are you going to run? Stop it already!

88
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,611
Useless. As long as I'm outside of this
line, there' no way he can catch me...

89
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:00,682
No, hold on. That's not good!

90
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,869
Impressive to see through that.

91
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,712
I see that you took your time to wait for the sun to come down.

92
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:20,798
It's to have the line of the wall shadow extended, and
hence increase the surface area of your body shadow.

93
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:26,681
As sun comes down, the shadow gets longer. Isn't that right?

94
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,343
So close!

95
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:40,250
But why can he use a shadow? He's
inside of the shadow of the arena.

96
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:48,315
If there's a slight light, then there will be a shadow
within a shadow. You don't know anything about Shikamaru.

97
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:52,191
Shadow in a shadow?

98
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:10,205
Calculating based on the height of the sun and the last max
distance of his attack, there's no trick of this distance.

99
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,319
Temari, above you!

100
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,211
I see.

101
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,932
What is it?

102
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:29,918
Damn it!

103
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,479
I'm not gonna let you run away.

104
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:52,140
Who'd guess he'll create a shadow he needed
by using his clothes as a parachute.

105
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,680
What a guy.

106
00:14:56,681 --> 00:15:01,360
If I noticed the parachute above, then my
attention to the shadow below me would be less.

107
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,492
It's an annoying attack without any chance to work.

108
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:09,259
But, that makes it very clear. Kagemaneno-jutsu is...

109
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:14,779
...a jutsu to catch the opponent by using other shadows.

110
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,065
You dodged this attack, too, eh?

111
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,948
He didn't have the good last move.

112
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:39,053
Yeah. His opponent is also a good
analyst. She read the next move very well.

113
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:52,533
If the fight goes slowly, the shadow of the arena
wall expands and his territory would expand, too.

114
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:58,244
I'll finish with the next move.

115
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:02,476
I make a feint operation with Bunshin-no jutsu.

116
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,201
Right now, his shadow is...

117
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,752
Good.

118
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,277
Bunshin no...

119
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,555
No way!

120
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:34,783
My body...

121
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,910
Finally, Kagemane no Jutsu succeeded.

122
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,461
What?

123
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:51,078
How's that possible?

124
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,391
How many moves ahead is he reading?

125
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:58,836
That's Shikamaru's ability.

126
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:05,466
Why doesn't my body move? His
shadow shouldn't be able to reach here.

127
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:09,923
I'll let you see behind you.

128
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,327
The hole...

129
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,901
You were watching it, too, right?

130
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:29,919
That hole is the one Naruto came out by digging through.

131
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,902
That’s why it's connected to the big hole in front of you.

132
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:41,245
That means there's a shadow inside of the hole...

133
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,932
Right.

134
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:46,955
This is Shogi with a lot of calculation.

135
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:58,251
Letting Temari know the limit of
the shadow and let her calculate...

136
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:03,945
...it over and over was the subplot
for the final use of the holes.

137
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:12,488
Temari always chased only the visible shadow, calculated
the limit line and battled from outside of the line.

138
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:19,936
He cornered her with an invisible shadow which is
outside of her calculation, and caught her from the behind.

139
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,715
There's no way out.

140
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,456
Perhaps...

141
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:33,303
The attack with his clothes shadow was to lead me to this position?

142
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:39,688
That was a subplot?  This guy...

143
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,694
The next is checkmate.

144
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:54,340
My body moves without my will. I can't stop it.

145
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:10,496
Everybody is into this game now.

146
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:14,156
A guy nobody marked was a good one.

147
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,789
Alright! Finish up!

148
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,035
Go, Shikamaru!

149
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,018
Checkmate.

150
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,936
I lose. I give up.

151
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:22,066
I told you that he gives up. Ino
doesn't know anything about Shikamaru.

152
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,328
What did you say?

153
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:34,410
I can't hold you any longer than 10 more seconds because
I used up my chakra for doing Kagemane so many times.

154
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:42,756
I thought about 200 of the next moves,
but all seem to be out of time.

155
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:50,926
It's so troublesome now. One game is enough for me.

156
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:55,085
What a strange guy.

157
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,192
Winner, Temari.

158
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,116
Wow, such a great cheer like nothing like before!

159
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:45,426
Of course. This exam's main battle's going to
start. Well, I am also looking forward to it.

160
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,875
Shikamaru. I couldn't hear what you said.

161
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:54,632
The main battle that everybody was long waited
for. There's nobody who's not excited in this arena.

162
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,626
Next Episode
Violent Crash! A moment when leaves dance
and Sand moves

163
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:02,363
I can never take my eyes off from this match.
