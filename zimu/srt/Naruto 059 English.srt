00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,758
Final Round Chunin Exam

3
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,129
Tomorrow...

4
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:59,475
Fierce Moo-Chase Moo-Dash
Final Exams Begin

5
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,299
What's up?

6
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,058
Long time no see.

7
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,987
I was in the hospital for a little while.

8
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:18,794
The hospital?

9
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:21,154
But, I'm alright now.

10
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,294
It was nothing serious.

11
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,834
Is that so?

12
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:28,907
Ayame

13
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,033
Yes.

14
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:33,030
Here you go.

15
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,467
Mister...

16
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:43,714
Go ahead and just eat it.

17
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,167
The final exam is tomorrow.

18
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,747
You're better off because you've got a daughter.

19
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,761
Most of my money goes towards food.

20
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,905
Stupid.

21
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,357
Your family is a special case.

22
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,897
Daughters are so much trouble eh?

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,891
Yeah...

24
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:20,846
Sometimes I don't know what to do with her.

25
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,749
Yeah, it's hard to be a father raising a girl.

26
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:27,662
So only I’m the only on saying something bad...

27
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,738
Hey mister!

28
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,437
An additional order...

29
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:34,112
Bring everything on this right page!

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,191
Welcome!

31
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,796
Look's like our powerful ally is here.

32
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,389
Come over here and order something.

33
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,350
Hey old man...

34
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,074
Lets go home.

35
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,397
What?

36
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,554
Shut up...

37
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,720
You're supposed to have fun at this festival.

38
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,753
What festival?

39
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,634
This is so troublesome.

40
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:04,922
Stupid...

41
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:07,414
Since the old times...

42
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:15,591
the final rounds are like a festival.

43
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:18,363
I have be there for the final round tomorrow.

44
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:21,455
Don't make this so hard.

45
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,096
You're in the final round?

46
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,910
Are you serious old man?

47
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:02,707
It's tomorrow...

48
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:05,184
Yep.

49
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,187
Tomorrow...

50
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,384
will be a full moon.

51
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,982
You didn't even get a scratch...

52
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,364
That was perfect Neji.

53
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,820
That's enough of a warm-up.

54
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:27,067
Let's go soon.

55
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:47,085
I couldn't sleep because I was nervous.

56
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,113
The first round is that guy...

57
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,435
Frankly, my sharingan can't even see chakra holes.

58
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:03,548
I told you before...

59
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,640
The strongest genin in konoha is on my team.

60
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,563
His name is Hyuga Neji.

61
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,145
It's almost time...

62
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,575
The first round starts hyuga neji match.

63
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,957
Yeah, last years #1 rookie. We can't miss it.

64
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,412
Hyuga Neji.

65
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:10,424
I was able to summon the frog so it will be alright.

66
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:19,337
Everybody has a such evil looking eyes.

67
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,920
Hinata?

68
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,537
Naruto-kun

69
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,286
Why are you here?

70
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,110
Isn't the final round today?

71
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:49,603
Yeah, in a little.

72
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:56,776
I came to see this practice place where I became a genin.

73
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,918
Why?

74
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:07,203
uh... no reason.

75
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,407
You're right.

76
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,110
Hey Hinata.

78
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,336
Neji is your cousin right?

79
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:21,339
Yes.

80
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,712
Is he really that strong?

81
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,256
Yes.

82
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,917
I see...

83
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:36,049
But Naruto, you may be able to win.

84
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:39,656
Yeah, because I'm strong.

85
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,025
Yeah, I think you'll definitely win.

86
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,357
When I was heard you cheering for me...

87
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:02,396
I felt I was a lot stronger.

88
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,886
Hinata! Do your best!

89
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,596
After the prelims were over I was able...

90
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:10,296
to like myself a little bit more.

91
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:25,126
I... don’t... bend... my words.

92
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,085
That's my nindo. (way of the ninja)

93
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,985
To other people I may look like I haven’t changed.

94
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:39,665
But I think I was able to change...

95
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:45,881
Thanks to you Naruto-kun.

96
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,125
Hey Hinata.

97
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:54,015
You really think so?

98
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:02,792
I may look strong, but I always make mistakes.

99
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:10,143
I'm so frustrated, looking strong is just an act.

100
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,955
That’s not true.

101
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:21,429
Naruto, even if you make mistakes...
you were always a proud failure.

102
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:32,973
Watching you touches my heart. You're not perfect... that’s why.

103
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:45,734
When you fail you gain the strength to get
better. I think that's the real source of strength.

104
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:52,220
Naruto-kun, I think you're a really strong person.

105
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,454
Thank you Hinata.

106
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:11,407
Wasn't I always the last in my class,
eh? I guess I was just trying too hard.

107
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:17,183
I was down unlike my usual self... but you've cheered me up.

108
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,961
Later. I'm going to the match.

109
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:34,441
I always thought you were...

110
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:39,461
a dark, hesitant, and slightly weird person.

111
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,361
But a person like you...

112
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,373
I like the person like you well.

113
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:53,893
I like you.

114
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:07,689
Oh yeah. Definitely come to see me beat Neji up.

115
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:14,223
Damnit. It's already that time?

116
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:18,211
I'm late. Later, Hinata!

117
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,705
Sorry, Hinata. I'm late.

118
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:29,528
Well, Shino's battle is later on, so...

119
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:32,923
Hey, Hinata?

120
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:45,622
What's up?

121
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,244
Oh. It'll begin!

122
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,953
Get out of my way!

123
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,263
I said get out of my way!

124
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,381
Shit. It's quite far... I'll be late!

125
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:06,023
Naruto Nichan (big bro)!

126
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,822
I'm here for you when you're in trouble!

127
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,675
Why are you at place like this?

128
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:20,749
I'll explain later. This way!

129
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,446
There's a special shortcut you can
get to the arena in a straight line.

130
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:29,993
What? Alright! Good job, Konohamaru!

131
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,918
One who controls an escape controls the time.

132
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,110
Oh, is that right? You're great, Konohamaru.

133
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:42,669
There must be a hole on a wall somewhere around here...

134
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,849
Here we go...

135
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,544
Huh? What's wrong, Konohamaru?

136
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:53,921
The escape route was fixed, it seems.

137
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,695
I don't have time anymore.

138
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,511
Bro!

139
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:00,115
Next hand.

140
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,631
Seriously, it's almost time!

141
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:12,007
It's a secret, but there is a great
path to get to the arena in one second!

142
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:16,187
What? Alright! Good job, Konohamaru!

143
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,684
This hole is the shortcut?

144
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:25,047
One straight line to the arena. It's for sure.

145
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,408
One straight line, eh?

146
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:30,784
Alright. Let's hurry up!

147
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:31,861
Yup!

148
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:40,050
Konohamaru. What's up with this?

149
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:43,495
Don't worry. In no time we'll be at the arena.

150
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:46,941
See. We can now see the end of the way.

151
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,994
Hot!

152
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:06,490
This must be a mistake...

153
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:18,475
What kind of structure is that?
Plus, we're getting further away!

154
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:22,744
It was connected to the arena until recently.

155
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,553
I have to find the next hand quickly...

156
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:30,796
This is it!

157
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,567
If you ride on this, you'll be at the arena in no time.

158
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,842
A cow, eh?

159
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,551
You don't understand, bro.

160
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:59,120
Once it starts to run seriously, no racing
horse can beat it. It's really a great one.

161
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,741
Bro. Count on this cow, and you'll be at arena soon.

162
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:13,891
Ok, then. I'm counting on you. Alright, go!

163
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:27,525
Ouch.

164
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,738
Bro. Do your best!

165
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,476
Hey. So many are missing...

166
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:21,602
What's going on? It's going to start soon.

167
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:25,143
What's going on, Sasuke-kun...

168
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:26,608
Plus even Naruto isn't here yet.

169
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,593
Why is it!

170
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:47,487
This isn't good.

171
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:50,668
Oh yeah! Kagebushin no jutsu!

172
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,787
Everyone. Ditch these raging cows!

173
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:56,496
Alright!

174
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:14,000
What are you guys doing? Why are you coming back here?!

175
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,976
New ones arrived. They cut off our escape route!

176
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,941
What are you doing increasing the number of cows!

177
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,369
What? Is that Uzumaki Naruto?

178
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,588
Please take care of them!

179
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,382
Hey, everybody else is already in the arena.

180
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,541
What a way to appear...

181
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,635
He's so late.

182
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,638
Troublesome...

183
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:12,486
Everyone! Run! All the cows in the village are chasing me here!

184
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,494
What are you talking about?

185
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:19,079
I'm serious. So many of them are...

186
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,080
Where's Sasuke?

187
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,111
My opponent, Dosu isn't here either.

188
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,965
Hey, you two over there... Stop being nervous.

189
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:36,614
Be proud and show your face well to the audience.

190
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:01,462
In this final round, you guys are the main event.

191
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:41,900
Hey Hinata. Look at me beating up this
unpleasant guy with your eyes wide open.

192
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,057
Besides this guy talks about my life like he knows everything.

193
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:49,502
One's fate is already decided when
he's born? Don't make me laugh.

194
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,241
A person can definitely change!

195
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,477
I'll prove that by defeating this guy!

196
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:59,103
Next episode

I'll definitely win!!

197
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,785
Stop talking and let's begin!
