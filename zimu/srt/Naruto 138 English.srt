1
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:16,949
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,545
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,386
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,657
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,862
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:40,237
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,611
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,206
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,585
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,588
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,956
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,424
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:08,298
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,039
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,371
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:19,242
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,508
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,049
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,484
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:49,106
<i>Pure Betrayal,</i>
<i>and a Fleeting Plea!</i>

21
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,448
Summoning Jutsu!

22
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,256
Naruto! Grab on!

23
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,625
Okay, pull him up!

24
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:11,996
There, eh?!

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,733
Damn! Was it a clone?!

26
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,699
Over here!

27
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,269
Counterattack, here it comes!

28
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,745
Rasengan, go!

29
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:30,808
What?!

30
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,718
You little...!

31
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,023
Yes!

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,291
Be careful, Naruto!
There are two others hiding

33
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,165
Hey, there they are!

34
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:51,996
Kagero!

35
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,606
Let's retreat for now!

36
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,871
Hold it!

37
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,346
Th They're totally quick
at running away!

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,161
Naruto, why're you spacing out?!

39
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,861
Where's Sakura?

40
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,432
Oh! Oh, no!

41
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,026
Sakura!

42
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,699
Oh! Naruto...

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,439
Thank goodness!
You're okay, Sasame.

44
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes... Sasame's okay.

45
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,808
Sasame's totally okay.

46
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,219
What're you mad about?

47
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,922
Let's take a break here.

48
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,701
Sakura... Who's the cute girl?

49
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,663
Okay! That's close enough...

50
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,063
What's the deal... Sakura?

51
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,838
Okay, don't come any closer!

52
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:09,581
Wh What... I'm only interested
in adult women!

53
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,173
You must not misunderstand...!

54
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,275
Don't misunderstand!

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,751
It's not a misunderstanding.

56
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,053
It seems Sakura's finally figured out
Pervy Sage's true nature!

57
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,018
I told you to stop calling me
a"Pervy Sage"!

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,858
Then you're the Lewd Sage!

59
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,358
Both of you stop it! Sasame's scared!

60
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

61
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,004
Jeez...

62
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,529
This girl is Sasame...

63
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,398
She's a Ninja from
the Land of Rice Paddies...

64
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,569
A member of the Fuma Clan.

65
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,273
She had her cousin taken away
by Orochimaru

66
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,040
and was looking for his hideout.

67
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,810
Right. And the Ninja just now
were after Sasame

68
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,253
in order to protect the secret
of the hideout!

69
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,457
Oh... With the Fuma Clan, huh?

70
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,150
Huh?! You know?

71
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:59,756
I had contact with Ninja in the town
who'd left the Fuma Clan.

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,167
What! So you were actually doing
some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!

73
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,329
I I can't believe it...!

74
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,437
Well you see, when I went to
this nice-looking bar,

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,775
it just turned out to be their hideout.

76
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,305
What! So after all, you were just
hanging out with some girls, right?

77
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,578
You mustn't talk in a way that'll
lead to a misunderstanding!

78
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,216
Even Sakura who respects me will...

79
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,188
I've long since stopped respecting you!

80
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,120
I... I see...

81
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,554
Members of the Fuma Clan...?

82
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,101
Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki
or something...

83
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,400
Hanzaki and the others are traitors
who abandoned the clan.

84
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:40,805
Oh...

85
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,708
Did those people do something

86
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,536
They were after my travel money,
so I taught them a lesson.

87
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,708
While at it, I attempted to ask them about
Orochimaru's hideout...

88
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,183
but they didn't know anything.

89
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:59,850
I can show you the way to
Orochimaru's hideout.

90
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,688
For real?!

91
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,352
Yes...

92
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,161
All right!

93
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,875
Your wound hasn't healed yet.
Don't push yourself.

94
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,044
Yes... but...

95
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,574
This is the entrance to
the Village Hidden in Sound.

96
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,620
Orochimaru's hideout is deep
in those mountains...

97
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:39,227
<i>I bet Sasuke is</i>
<i>somewhere in those mountains...</i>

98
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,329
Okay, at last!

99
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,069
Let's hurry!

100
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,261
Well, hold on...

101
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:48,804
Why?!

102
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:53,578
If we don't hurry, night will fall before
we arrive at Orochimaru's hideout...

103
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,005
That's right!

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,539
Sasuke is just a stone's throw away!
Pervy Sage!

105
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,386
If we're going to save him,
we should do it as soon as possible!

106
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,449
Why do we have to wait?!

107
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,217
Huh?

108
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,654
What?

109
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,759
Gee...

110
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,426
Well... I'm hungry, you see...

111
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,768
You know... All Shinobi must...

112
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,066
I can't fight if I'm hungry!

113
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,166
Up ahead will become full blown
enemy territory.

114
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,976
We won't have time to
have relaxed meals, so...

115
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,349
Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!

116
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,922
Mm, this is good...

117
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,489
You prepared this especially for us?

118
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:47,591
No. It seems the prettiest girl
in the bar fell to my charm, you see.

119
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,700
She made these with tender loving care.

120
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,910
I'll go make some tea.

121
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,242
Oh... thanks...

122
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,935
Tastes pretty good.

123
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,701
Tea is ready.

124
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,638
Here you go!

125
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,309
Here you go.

126
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,404
Thanks...

127
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,877
Here you go.

128
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,844
Thank you, Sasame...

129
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,479
Sasame, you should come here
and eat with us, too.

130
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,619
Okay...

131
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,876
Pervy Sage... What's wrong...?!

132
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,184
Naruto!

133
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,083
Sasame did it...

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,853
Since it's come to this, they're ours.

135
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,989
Your wound still hasn't healed.

136
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,835
Kagero, you wait here.

137
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,903
No mistake... They're Leaf Ninja.

138
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,875
If we take care of the Leaf pursuers...

139
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:16,405
Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge
the power of the Fuma Clan.

140
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,381
Yeah...

141
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,743
Let's come back with good news.

142
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,387
And with the heads of
the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!

143
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,635
I finally found it!

144
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,977
At first, I thought it was someone
from the Hidden Leaf Village.

145
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,851
But it's Sasame, believe it or not...

146
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,593
Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero...

147
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,994
This is an odd reunion.

148
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,798
Where's Arashi?!
He wasn't with all you guys?!

149
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:52,776
Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru
and is spending his days training.

150
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,446
Can I see Arashi?!

151
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,512
If you're also going to work together
with us for Lord Orochimaru,

152
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,248
I'm sure you'll be able to see him.

153
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,094
How'd it go?

154
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,639
You've done well.

155
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,573
With this, I'll be able to see Arashi, right?

156
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,710
After we've finished them off!

157
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,250
Why?! Weren't we just supposed to
take them to Lord Orochimaru

158
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,312
for examination after capturing them?!

159
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,982
We only need the heads
for the examination.

160
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,425
No!

161
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,854
These people... For my sake...!

162
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,624
Move it!

163
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:50,799
- Wha?!
- Huh?!

164
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,436
What?!

165
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,704
The Fuma numbing medicine
didn't work!

166
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,240
We knew about it all along
from the beginning!

167
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,073
Sakura!

168
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,389
<i>Substitution...?!</i>

169
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,953
I leave Sasame to you!

170
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,016
Leave her to me!

171
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,322
Sasame... Hang in there!

172
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,530
Why? Why does Sasame have
to do something like this?!

173
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,607
No, it's not that she's doing it
against her will...!

174
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,975
It's something she wanted to do!

175
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,147
Liar!

176
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,342
It's true...

177
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,549
What...

178
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,613
What should I do to be able
to see Arashi again?

179
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,622
It's not a difficult thing.

180
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,418
You just have to put the lights out of those
who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.

181
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,427
We have to kill them...?!

182
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,863
We'll take them back to Lord Orochimaru
for examination.

183
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,532
So we're not going to kill, right?

184
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,965
If we carry out that work,
Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.

185
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,138
Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone
are being tricked by Orochimaru.

186
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,809
He says that you'll just be used
and thrown away...

187
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,451
Hanzaki's just a traitor
who abandoned the village.

188
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,776
Will you believe what we say?

189
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,618
Or will you believe what a traitor says?

190
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,023
Lord Orochimaru will surely restore
our Fuma Clan...

191
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:30,400
Sasame, although you're still young,
you're also one of the Fuma.

192
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,503
Assist in the restoration
of our Fuma Clan...

193
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,746
So you guys did trick Sasame!

194
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,675
It's all for the restoration
of the Fuma Clan!

195
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,822
You little!

196
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,864
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

197
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,359
Here I go!

198
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,158
Wha!

199
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,998
U zu ma ki...!

200
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,433
Naruto Barrage!

201
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,604
<i>This is bad...!</i>

202
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,049
Rasengan!

203
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,634
This is for Sasame.
Prepare yourselves!

204
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,402
Naruto!

205
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,115
You're... from before?!

206
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,743
The Earth Style Jutsu user
in question, huh?

207
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,552
However, there's no point to using that
Art in this rocky area.

208
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:04,454
Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from
inside the ground

209
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,794
and the spreading of its wings under
the sunlight is

210
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,993
but a momentary gleam.

211
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,235
That's when I die as Kagero!

212
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:17,910
Be careful!

213
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,385
What's this...?

214
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,116
Look! Naruto...

215
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,022
Wha?!

216
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,533
U Unbelievable!

217
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,476
You were a woman...?!

218
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,344
The clan will once again be
in a place lit by the sunlight...

219
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,843
Lord Orochimaru promised that...

220
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:07,249
I'll use this once in a lifetime Art
if it's for the sake of that.

221
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,731
Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!

222
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,028
Naruto! Come with me!

223
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,372
Naruto!

224
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,031
I I feel like... I've seen this before...

225
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,160
It's Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.

226
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,235
I summoned the extraordinarily
sturdy stomach of

227
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,538
the Mount Myoboku's
Iwajuku Giant Toad.

228
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,304
Stomach...?

229
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:02,912
Yikes!

230
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,149
It's melting...

231
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,512
If I didn't do this,

232
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,815
we wouldn't have been able to
defend ourselves from her Chakra.

233
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,969
I believed... that the clan
would someday...

234
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,911
I believed in that.

235
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,956
Sh She vanished.

236
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,458
I've got to hand it to her.

237
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,226
She probably put all of her life
on the line

238
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,423
and attempted to save her comrades...

239
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,698
It's unforgivable!

240
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,501
Those guys...
the Fuma Ninja...

241
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,399
Their feelings toward the clan
is the same as our feelings!

242
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:11,310
Manipulating the Fuma's desire
to restore their clan...

243
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:17,580
I'll kick Orochimaru's butt, no matter what!

244
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,132
Wh Where are we?

245
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,737
Kagero!

246
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,842
You risked your life to save us?

247
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,585
You idiot...

248
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,234
Please...

249
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,178
Please use your Medical Ninjutsu
to save her.

250
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,275
Our comrade doesn't have
long to live!

251
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,851
Put your hands to your chests and think.

252
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:28,420
Think about what you weren't
able to accomplish... okay?

253
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:34,098
We risked our lives working for you...
to help you, Lord Orochimaru.

254
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,596
In order to restore the Fuma Clan!

255
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,933
Please recognize our work!

256
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:46,101
You'll just have to atone for
your failure with your bodies.

257
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,548
Lord Orochimaru!

258
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,353
I'm sorry for the betrayal!

259
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:28,647
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

260
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:35,024
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

261
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:45,595
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

262
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:55,371
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

263
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:02,110
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

264
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:11,420
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

265
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:23,133
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

266
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:33,576
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

267
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,329
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

268
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,497
That's Orochimaru's residence!

269
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,132
It really is just like him to construct
his residence underground.

270
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,675
Sasuke is somewhere inside
that residence, right?

271
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,268
Sakura, let's hurry!

272
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:00,835
Right!

273
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,643
Be careful!
First Avenue of hell is up ahead!

274
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,408
Will a devil appear,
or will a snake appear?

275
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,145
Heh! I'm looking forward to it!

276
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,980
I'll kick the butts of the devil
and the snake.

277
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,683
And I'll save Sasuke and Arashi!

278
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,923
Next episode, "Pure Terror!
The House of Orochimaru"
