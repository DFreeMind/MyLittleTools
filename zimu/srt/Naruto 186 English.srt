1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,601
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:06,436
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:12,538
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:28,996
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:34,434
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:37,131
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,642
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:45,169
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:51,809
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:56,850
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,925 --> 00:01:02,295
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:07,700
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,863
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:19,677
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:46,201
<i>Laughing Shino</i>

16
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,669
Shino!
Let's rest a little!

17
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,582
I'm tired from doing nothing but
walk since this morning, believe it!

18
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,181
You're okay while
you can say you are tired.

19
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,615
It's because you still have
energy left to talk.

20
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,216
Nothing but quibbling as usual...

21
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:05,791
Man, I'm unlucky.

22
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,829
To be stuck on a mission alone
with Shino.

23
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:15,970
Hey, old lady.

24
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,602
Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?

25
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:22,072
Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?

26
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,136
Yeah!

27
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:26,478
Then you'll be right there
once you cross this path.

28
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,839
Really? Thank goodness.

29
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,551
But exercise great caution...

30
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:33,445
Huh?

31
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,181
Dead people also laugh
in Motoyoshi Village...

32
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:40,357
It will be all over if
you're lured into laughing.

33
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:50,063
Naruto.

34
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,005
It's Motoyoshi Village.

35
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:56,267
<i>We never imagined it at this time...</i>

36
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,672
<i>To think that in this village...</i>

37
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:03,946
<i>an incident too terrifying to</i>
<i>even talk about would occur...</i>

38
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,647
In Mourning

39
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,936
I'm Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.

40
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:26,338
I'm Shino Aburame.

41
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,538
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

42
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:32,510
Will
Getting right down to business...

43
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:37,181
This is the will of my father,
Tobei Kagetsu.

44
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:39,344
What's this?!

45
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,821
My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,

46
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,359
shall inherit the entire
Kagetsu family estate...

47
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:48,656
HOWEVER...

48
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,432
A funeral is to be held tomorrow
in Motoyoshi Village

49
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,299
for the head of the Kagetsu family
that owns that stretch of mountains.

50
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,563
I'd like you two to go.

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,573
Funeral security, huh?
Naruto can't do it.

52
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,572
What do you mean?!

53
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,173
It's because you have
the most inappropriate face

54
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,909
in the Leaf Village.

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,310
Say what?!

56
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:10,712
I think so as well.

57
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,919
But there's nobody else.

58
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,224
So I reluctantly decided
to add Naruto.

59
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,551
You'll be the main guy
on this mission, Shino.

60
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:25,098
You're probably the best suited
for this mission.

61
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,025
Huh?

62
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:26,993
As it happens,

63
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,731
there's one more important mission
in addition to security.

64
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:34,005
You'll understand when
you see the will.

65
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:38,342
However, in the event that Futa raises
his voice in laughter at the funeral,

66
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,177
he shall lose inheriting rights
and upon consultation,

67
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,843
the estate shall be divided up between
the bereaved family members excluding Futa.

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,445
This will doesn't make any sense at all...

69
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,289
An abundance of medicinal herbs
can be picked in the mountains

70
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,916
owned by the Kagetsu family.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,294
I would have no trouble getting
by for the rest of my life

72
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,351
if I were to inherit the estate.

73
00:04:55,697 --> 00:05:00,657
But all that will all go down the drain
just by laughing at the funeral!

74
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,502
There's no doubt that the relatives
will be in a frenzy

75
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:06,063
trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.

76
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,335
To be honest,

77
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,274
I don't have the confidence
to withstand it.

78
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:18,951
But there is one salvation!

79
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:20,351
According to the will,

80
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,755
it's acceptable if I, the chief mourner,
were to appoint a substitute!

81
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,926
And so I commissioned the Leaf!

82
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:29,630
I asked for someone who
absolutely will not laugh!

83
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:32,433
This is no doubt the perfect mission
for Shino.

84
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:35,100
I've never seen
this guy laugh before.

85
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,101
Indeed, I leave it to you.

86
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:39,937
I understand.

87
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,376
Big Brother, dinner's ready.

88
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,208
This is my little sister Mai,
the youngest.

89
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,613
She lived together with
my father in this large home.

90
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,949
She was also the one at his deathbed
during his final moments.

91
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,283
Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.

92
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,023
Nice to meet you...

93
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,429
Let's eat!

94
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:03,487
Wait!

95
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,832
First, I'll taste for poison.

96
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:07,131
Taste for poison...?!

97
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,203
I don't think there would be anyone
among the relatives

98
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:11,637
who would go that far...

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,434
But you can never be too careful.

100
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:16,369
You've got a point.

101
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,769
Will you be all right, Shino?

102
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:21,775
No problem.
Even if it did contain poison,

103
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:24,447
the Parasitic Insects in
my body will dissolve it for me.

104
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,219
Parasitic... Insects?

105
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,433
How is it?

106
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:45,571
It's all right...

107
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,774
<i>Shino...laughed?!</i>

108
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,219
He seems to be in very high spirits.
Which means the food is fine...

109
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,658
Don't eat!

110
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:10,425
Shino laughing like
this is definitely strange, believe it!

111
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,365
There's a laughing drug in this food!

112
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,336
Who cooked the food?

113
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,370
I did.

114
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,537
But the back door isn't locked...

115
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,810
So anyone could get in if they wanted to.

116
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:30,450
To think there would be
someone in the family

117
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,247
who would go so far as to poison!

118
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:36,323
Oh, no... The drug has gotten to the insects!

119
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,352
No good...
They can't dissolve the drug.

120
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,827
Then what will we do about
the funeral tomorrow?!

121
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:48,826
<i>This is a sight that doesn't seem</i>
<i>of this world, believe it!</i>

122
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:49,829
Naruto!

123
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,801
Even if we were to
contact the village now,

124
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,672
we wouldn't be in time...
for the funeral...

125
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,410
So Naruto!

126
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:01,712
You...

127
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:04,479
will have to participate in the funeral
as the chief mourner's substitute!

128
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:07,585
No way...

129
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:09,181
Naruto.

130
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,854
I'm very uneasy, but I'll be counting on you.

131
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,292
I'm also very uneasy, believe it...

132
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,202
Will you knock it off?! I can't sleep!

133
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,948
You're early, Tsukiko.

134
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:36,882
You're already here, huh?

135
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,515
It's dad's funeral, after all.
I came here in great haste.

136
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,054
Who's that kid?

137
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,860
This is Naruto whom I've asked to
be my substitute as chief mourner

138
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,897
since I'm not feeling so well.

139
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:50,693
Nice to meet you!

140
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:54,668
That's how it's going to be,
so I will be leaving just with the greetings.

141
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,269
I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,336
To think you can't inherit the estate
if you laugh at the funeral...

143
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:03,871
Be careful.

144
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,609
She's my immediate younger sister
in question, Tsukiko.

145
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,475
Five years ago,
she married into the next village over...

146
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,989
But she's probably the one
after this estate the most.

147
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,287
That kid will be a cinch.

148
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:26,995
Each and every one of them...
Iooks greedy...

149
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:36,739
What's that...?

150
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,417
The monk has arrived.

151
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:06,131
<i>Why choose a monk like this,</i>
<i>of all people?</i>

152
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,435
<i>I have no knowledge of this!</i>

153
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,034
<i>It's a different person from</i>
<i>the monk at the meeting.</i>

154
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:17,852
<i>Don't laugh...</i>

155
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,943
<i>Don't laugh...</i>

156
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,918
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

157
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,892
Now then, allow me to begin.

158
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,168
What was that sound?

159
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,435
Wasn't it the wind blowing?

160
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:44,669
Naruto, did you not raise your voice
and laugh just now?

161
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,613
No, I didn't!
I didn't laugh at all, believe it!

162
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,479
Mai, you heard it, right?

163
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:50,748
I don't know...

164
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,720
I only heard the sound of
barrels falling over.

165
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:56,751
Well, fine.

166
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,818
<i>The funeral has only just begun.</i>

167
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:02,192
<i>There are still plenty of chances...</i>

168
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:05,725
<i>After all, the opponent is this kid</i>
<i>with a stupid look.</i>

169
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:07,928
<i>I'm saved...</i>

170
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,202
<i>Shino, huh? Thanks!</i>

171
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,645
That was a close shave...

172
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,582
In order, please.

173
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:28,655
Then I'll go first.

174
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:39,331
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

175
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,634
No good... He won't laugh at that...

176
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,072
I'll give it one more push.

177
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,565
<i>Don't laugh...!</i>

178
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,634
<i>I must not laugh!</i>

179
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,868
<i>This kid is nothing.</i>

180
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,276
<i>I'll kill him with laughter with</i>
<i>that technique of mine...</i>

181
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,483
<i>This guy also intends on</i>
<i>doing something, huh?</i>

182
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,280
<i>No matter what he does,</i>
<i>no way will I laugh!</i>

183
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,486
<i>Kiyoyasu!</i>

184
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,864
- Kiyoyasu!
- Kiyoyasu is...

185
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:10,828
Here it comes...

186
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:15,700
<i>Whatever he hits me with. I...!</i>

187
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>I must not laugh!</i>

188
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,136
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

189
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,072
A flower came out...

190
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,879
<i>Don't laugh...!</i>

191
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,976
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

192
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>Don't laugh, don't laugh, don't laugh...</i>

193
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:44,791
Laugh... Laugh... Laugh...

194
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,496
<i>I won't laugh...no matter what!</i>

195
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,105
<i>He's pretty tough...</i>

196
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,104
<i>But how long can he hold on for?</i>

197
00:12:55,843 --> 00:13:00,906
<i>We'll make him laugh by the time</i>
<i>the funeral ends without fail!</i>

198
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,047
<i>That...old woman...</i>

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,254
<i>Dead people also laugh</i>
<i>in Motoyoshi Village...</i>

200
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:18,659
<i>It will be all over if you're lured</i>
<i>into laughing.</i>

201
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,627
<i>What's she doing in a place like this?</i>

202
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:24,597
Who's there?!

203
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:25,331
<i>Uh, oh!</i>

204
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:29,539
Oh, it's you Mai...

205
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:54,601
With this, it's over!
We'll put this in everyone's tea!

206
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,004
But...

207
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,130
Everything will go well with this!

208
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,238
I don't know about that.

209
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,178
Who're you?!

210
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,405
Shino...

211
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,920
I heard everything...

212
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,722
<i>How frustrating...</i>

213
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,497
<i>If this guy would just laugh,</i>
<i>I'd get some of the estate...</i>

214
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,698
Thank you indeed for today.
Allow me to thank you all...

215
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,708
in place of the chief mourner.

216
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,642
<i>With this, the mission is complete...</i>

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,275
It looks like it will somehow
end all right.

218
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,417
Once the monk goes home,
the funeral will be over.

219
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:45,684
Please wait!

220
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:51,183
Please let my husband say
thank you as well. Okay, dear.

221
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:03,296
Hi! Thanks for coming today.

222
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,194
Huh?

223
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:05,131
Huh?

224
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,900
<i>Wh What's he going to do?!</i>

225
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:12,376
It was a very nice funeral.
I was so moved!

226
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,813
It's tear jerking.

227
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,022
<i>That Tsukiko...</i>
<i>To think she would go this far.</i>

228
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,520
<i>Naruto, if you can get through this,</i>
<i>it will be over.</i>

229
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,392
<i>Please withstand it...!</i>

230
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,957
<i>It doesn't hurt at all!</i>

231
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,026
<i>I must remember something sad</i>
<i>at a time like this!</i>

232
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,707
<i>Why do I think of the Pervy Sage</i>
<i>at a time like this?!</i>

233
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,943
<i>All right, now is the time</i>
<i>to finish him off.</i>

234
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:49,676
This is awful!
The tears are causing my face to collapse.

235
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,911
What're you talking about?

236
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:54,213
Your face... is right here!

237
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,057
<i>N No!</i>

238
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:00,489
Oh, no...

239
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:01,823
Yes!

240
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:04,890
What?

241
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,533
D-Dad...

242
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,876
You're alive? Dad?!

243
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,314
Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!

244
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,576
Dad hates fighting!

245
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,883
I've thought up a good joke.

246
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,721
I've thought up a good joke, too.

247
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,590
Who're those kids...?
Where'd they come from?

248
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,259
I'd get dad to laugh, first!

249
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,762
I will be the first! You stay out of it!

250
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,265
Stop it! Fighting's wrong!

251
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:44,162
It's as Mai says.
Fighting's wrong! Wrong.

252
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,804
Futa! Tsukiko!

253
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,735
- Futa?!
- Tsukiko?!

254
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,474
N -Now that you mention it...

255
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:55,141
Yeah... They are indeed us
from our childhood!

256
00:16:56,484 --> 00:17:00,477
Oh, fighting's wrong! A kettle's a kettle!

257
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,951
My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!

258
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,792
Groping is wrong!
Hot sake is where it's at.

259
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,161
My wife's secret stash is kept in a safe.

260
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,797
Between my legs...

261
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,129
Ding, dong, ding.

262
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,660
Yeah, ding dong ding.
Yeah, ding dong ding.

263
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,174
Yeah, ding dong ding.
Yeah, ding dong ding.

264
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,267
Yeah, ding dong ding.

265
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:24,341
Ding-dong.

266
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:26,141
- That's right...
- Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

267
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,273
- When we were kids...
- Ding. Yeah, ding dong ding.

268
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,283
- Dad made us laugh a lot
- Ding-dong-ding.

269
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:31,784
- With his silly jokes...
- Ding-dong.

270
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,081
- It's been a long time
- Ding. Ding.

271
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,213
- Since I laughed at dad's jokes...
- Dong dong dong. Dong

272
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:38,986
- Dong-dong
- This is it! This is what I wanted to see!

273
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,135
Dad!

274
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,464
Then who's this?

275
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,640
The laughter stopped.

276
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:58,839
Shino!

277
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,574
I'm sorry, everyone!

278
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:05,276
But I didn't think you'd all come
if it weren't my funeral...

279
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:10,255
Mai helped me out a bunch
and this was the plan.

280
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,591
Is that really you, Dad? You're alive.

281
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,925
Why'd you do this?!

282
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,764
In the old days,
before we knew that

283
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,268
the medicinal herbs we could pick
in the mountains would be profitable...

284
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,728
We were poor...

285
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,329
But we were bursting with laughter.

286
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,914
However, we got rich from selling
the medicinal herbs at a high price.

287
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,210
And when we'd open our mouths,

288
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,878
we'd start saying,
"Money! Money! Money!"

289
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,388
And the smiles vanished from
everyone's faces.

290
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:47,786
I wanted everyone to remember
what's important.

291
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:51,129
I wanted to get back
the family's smiling faces!

292
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,998
If I wrote that ridiculous will,

293
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,798
everyone would do stupid things
trying to get Futa to laugh.

294
00:18:57,338 --> 00:19:02,366
And then not only Futa,
but everyone would laugh and have fun...

295
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,502
Happiness isn't money!

296
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,482
It's living while getting along
with everyone and laughing!

297
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,983
I remember...

298
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,187
Sure enough, laughter is important.

299
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,656
That's right...

300
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,321
To be honest, I'm sick of living
at the mercy of money.

301
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:26,764
You liar! You're the one saying
money this and money that the most.

302
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,962
There are different kinds of "money,"
and what I was talking about was...

303
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:32,866
This bell.

304
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,148
Could that be...?

305
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,483
It's the laughing drug.

306
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,452
It's still at experimental stage, though.

307
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,659
If I made it okay to appoint
a substitute chief mourner,

308
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:03,033
Futa would summon someone
who definitely wouldn't laugh.

309
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,269
So I tested it out on that person first.

310
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:11,237
I was going to make everyone laugh
by putting this in everyone's tea

311
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:14,679
if nobody had laughed by
the end of the funeral.

312
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:15,978
But...

313
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,551
<i>There's no point to laughter</i>
<i>using a drug...</i>

314
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,651
<i>It's because the people</i>
<i>wouldn't be laughing</i>

315
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,214
<i>from the bottom of their hearts.</i>

316
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:31,423
<i>Instead, they'd be crying in their hearts...</i>

317
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,692
<i>Like me right now!</i>

318
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,803
So at the end of the day,
what happened with the mission?

319
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:44,834
It's probably a success.

320
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,548
It's because the Lady Hokage probably
knew about the real mission.

321
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,078
Say say.

322
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:53,814
You transformed into that old man, right?

323
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:58,148
Then the " Between my legs,
ding dong ding" thing was something you...

324
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:00,688
Forget about that.

325
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,391
Absolutely forget about that.

326
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,492
O Okay, got it.

327
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,396
Then, fine.

328
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,836
<i>Sure enough, I...</i>

329
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,803
<i>I can't get used to this guy...</i>

330
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:29,321
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

331
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:35,993
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

332
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,601
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

333
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,482
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

334
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:03,580
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

335
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:10,563
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

336
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:17,469
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

337
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:24,239
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

338
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:31,012
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

339
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:37,690
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

340
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:44,724
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

341
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,469
The mission this time around is
a commission from the Land of Greens

342
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,837
and is protection for
some traveling merchants.

343
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,138
This is just a D rank mission.

344
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,304
Don't complain. The castle lord there
is a benefactor of mine.

345
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,343
Make sure you do nothing wrong.

346
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,542
I could manage a mission like
that asleep, believe it.

347
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,242
Very well.
