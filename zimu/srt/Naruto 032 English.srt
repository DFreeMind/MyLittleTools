I will show  you  a limit that your engagement
it will not be able to never make you to exceed.

17
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,450
The invicibile formation!
Ino-shika-cho!

18
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,340
Your movements are to high speed

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,960
 but we exceed them with the speed of sound.

20
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
Lee-saint!

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,340
The left ear

22
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,550
Use a small trick.

23
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,630
Enough not to schivare

24
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,490
 my attacks.

25
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,340
Cos' you have made!

26
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,430
I use I play.

27
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,100
Even if you have schivato the blow
the sound has hit you.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
The sound?

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,000
You know cos' you are the sound, not?

30
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,900
Vibrations.

31
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,500
Exactly.

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,440
To feel a sound means

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,470
 that the eardrum is recependo
the vibrations of the air.

34
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,430
The human eardrum is broken off
when the sound exceeds the 150 Mhz.

35
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,200
Moreover, more in depth of the eardrum it exists
an inner membrane that if it comes damaged

36
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,560
 all the your body loses the equilibrium.

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,170
For a po' you will not be able to move perfectly.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,900
The simple one taijitsu does not work against of we.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,620
However six state Bravo.

40
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,840
You have forced to me to show mine jutsu.
E' already something.

41
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,650
I succeed to produce supersonic waves
and to vary the pressure of the air.

42
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,000
I even succeed to crack one cliff

43
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,180
Omote Renge!

44
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,180
 and to modify the air to the ground
in order to create a pillow.

45
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,410
Our techniques are very various
from your moved ridicules.

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,540
Eternal damnation!

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Lee

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,880
You will be able to use this single movement

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,560
 when you must protect who loves.

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Protect who I love?

51
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,730
But  the six best state to learn it!

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,240
Very made, Lee.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,250
Eternal damnation

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well.

55
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,610
Next the six

56
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,480
 you!

57
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,390
It arrives!

58
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,400
Lee-saint!

59
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,780
Konoha Senpuu!

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,430
The blow before has made effect.

61
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,540
You have been strange to me

62
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,000
 but in this your attack
you have lost your speed.

63
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,620
This arm

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,000
 it amplifies to the maximum the acute sounds

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,810
 that they are accumulateed to the inside.

66
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,700
Lee-saint!

67
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,170
The sound propaga
in the direction of the arm

68
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,500
 but towards the target
established through the chakra.

69
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Lee-saint!

70
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,540
E' the hour of the grace blow.

71
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,270
You  I will not allow.

72
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh Sciocca

73
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,470
Hey! Scappiamo!
Those three are indeed dangerous!

74
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,180
It seems that Naruto and Sasuke have been puttinges KO.

75
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,830
Also Lee has been defeated
and Sakura is remained single.

76
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,160
What you want to make Ino?

77
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,760
In that sense?

78
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,920
Sakura is in danger. T' it does not import?

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,560
You were not many friends?

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,410
Hey

81
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,300
What is Sakura?

82
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,740
Perche six become cos   serious?

83
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,620
E' that

84
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,120
 Ino-chan

85
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,260
Then? Ahead dimmi.

86
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,270
I have felt that also to you it appeals to Sasuke-kun.

87
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,000
Then, of hour in then we will be you avail again.

88
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,490
Why?

89
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,400
Why comes me in mind that time?

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,450
Hey!

91
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,000
Ino!

92
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,000
What we make?

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,960
I have understood but what we can make?

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,960
We cannot simply jump outside!

95
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,580
If I exit hour

96
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,970
 I will only embed .

97
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,190
I can anch'

98
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,000
The pressure of the air

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,610
 it has rejected my Shuriken!

100
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,110
But it watches that beautiful hats cure to you.

101
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,460
Instead curing hats to you, it trains to you!

102
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,230
A ninja it does not have to be sensuale.

103
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,670
Zaku!

104
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,710
You kill that Sasuke in front of this ninja.

105
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,930
Ah, optimal idea!

106
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,630
Hey, Hey

107
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,600
You  I will not allow!

108
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,860
Not to move to you!!

109
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,630
Sakura-chan!

110
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,390
I not....

111
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,920
 I will be  never indeed strong.

112
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,290
They are

113
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,590
 once again

114
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,520
.... a useless weight.

115
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,400
Always protect from someone.

116
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,630
I cannot accept it!

117
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,360
I thought to make it us.

118
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,820
At least this time

119
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,690
 I had protect the persons to me beloveds.

120
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,180
Then....

121
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,860
 we begin!

122
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Hey! Also Sasuke and Naruto are in the troubles!

123
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,490
What I can make?

124
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,720
Useless!

125
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,480
You cannot makes me null with those kunai.

126
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,210
Cos' you have understood?

127
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,910
What !?

128
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,540
I always have

129
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,460
 thought to be an optimal one ninja.

130
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,820
I have always asserted that it appealed to Sasuke-kun to me.

131
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,000
Sgrido always Naruto with superiority air.

132
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,550
But I

133
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,940
 I was always behind of they.

134
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,970
It is behind

135
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,860
You are down!

136
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,580
Now

137
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,860
We can begin!

138
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,210
This is the only way in order to defeat it!

139
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,580
Sasuke!

140
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,950
" Now! "

141
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,440
They have always fought for proteggermi.

142
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,400
Lee-saint.

143
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,870
Lee-saint.

144
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,720
You have said that I appealed to to you

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,660
You  protegger  until death!

146
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,300
Omote Renge

147
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,850
Being to me neighbor, you have risked your life.

148
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,820
I feel to have learned something from you.

149
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,140
Sakura-chan!

150
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,690
Sakura-saint!

151
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,900

Sakura

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
Kin! You kill it!

160
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,210
That position I know it.

161
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,100
Kawarimi not jutsu!

162
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,210

Useless E'!

Atmospheric pressure 100%!
Supersonic wave 0%!

All here!

169
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,150

What diavo!

176
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,990

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,250
They always take to you in turn

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,680

Sakura.

185
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,160
I do not succeed to feel to you!

186
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,400

187
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,600
Sakura Haruno.
