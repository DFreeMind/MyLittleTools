2
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:44,268
Disqualified!? Danger! Ahead of Schedule!
Trouble in the Main Tournament!

3
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,480
Alright!

4
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:05,538
I'd never have thought that the fox-kid
would put up such a good fight.

5
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:42,937
He still has power to run around... man, he's a stamina freak.

6
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,276
I did it!

7
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:48,151
Naruto is getting stronger and stronger...

8
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,156
He is good, isn't he?

9
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:53,287
Yeah, he has a good sense.

10
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:54,919
And he's kinda cute.

11
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,544
I envy you...

12
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:08,361
Watching your fight makes me feel that I should
work harder, too. That's the amazing thing.

13
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:17,310
Ahhh... he won... I can't believe it.

14
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:21,619
I thought he was one of the uncool guys like me.

15
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,610
Uncool guys?

16
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:27,607
Everybody's cheering for him now
and he looks like a cool guy now.

17
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:34,312
I probably can't beat him... That's
seriously not good... I'm so depressed.

18
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:38,381
He channeled and used the Kyubi's
chakra without losing himself.

19
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:43,393
Yeah, most of Konoha here were surprised.

20
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:50,431
Naruto was able to control Kyubi's
chakra... since when did he learn that skill?

21
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,324
I'm the best!

22
00:03:55,325 --> 00:04:02,656
Even a captured bird, as it tries to open
the cage with its beak, gets smarter.

23
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:12,097
It doesn't give up to fly free in the sky again.

24
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,307
This time, it's your loss.

25
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,796
Father...

26
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,584
Don't worry. There's no damage to your inner organs.

27
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,590
You seem too have used up almost all your chakra.

28
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,369
You're not the only one whose "special".

29
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,211
Why do you try so hard to go against your fate?

30
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:55,627
Because I was called a loser!

31
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,668
People who become Hokage are born with such a fate.

32
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,530
So what?!

33
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:08,976
Hyuga-sama.

34
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:14,474
Please leave us alone.

35
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,176
But...

36
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,182
It won't take long.

37
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,938
Yes.

38
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,459
What brought you here?

39
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,945
That day...

40
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,556
I came here to tell you the truth about that day.

41
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,130
That day?

42
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:15,382
Back then, I was planning to die.

43
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:20,247
What are you saying?

44
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:24,943
My father was killed as your double then.

45
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,017
The truth about that day is here.

46
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:44,256
It must be more excuses that the Souke made up.

47
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:49,281
You should be able to understand it now.

48
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:53,997
"To Neji"

49
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,851
This handwriting is my...

50
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:08,372
Neji, I have only a short time left.

51
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:13,716
I have something I want to tell you before then.

52
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,066
Something he wants to tell me?

53
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:25,543
The Shinobi-kashira of Kaminari who tried to abduct
Hinata-sama was killed by Hiashi-sama instead.

54
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,932
Because of the death of their Shinobi-kashira
the Kaminari demands were harsh.

55
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:36,557
They wouldn't even admit that they tried to abduct her.

56
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,219
There's nothing else we can do. If we
can save this village with only my life...

57
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,941
Wait Hiashi. Don't rush to that conclusion.

58
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:56,007
The blood-limit of the Hyuga is a
great last hand for this village.

59
00:07:56,754 --> 00:08:01,099
It is the Souke's duty to protect it forever.

60
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,538
But, in the name of that duty, if this
village goes into such a hopeless war...

61
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,255
I know that. That's why...

62
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,150
There’s the Bunke for that reason.

63
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:21,120
We will give Hizashi's dead body as your double.

64
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:26,630
Hizashi has already agreed to it.

65
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:37,875
But what they want is the secret of this Byakugan.

66
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:43,629
If it's Hizashi, the secret will be sealed when he dies.

67
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,211
I don't believe the Kaminari will consent to...

68
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:58,419
That may be what they really want. But what the Kaminari
demanded was to hand over Hyuga Hiashi's dead body.

69
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:07,501
Since we will accept their demand and give them Hizashi's
body, which is identical to yours, they can't complain.

70
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,908
But...!

71
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:22,081
Hiashi, the time has come. Every ancestor of
the Hyuga Souke has protected the clan like this.

72
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:27,269
You have to have the mind to let go, even
if it's your sibling, or family member.

73
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:39,147
That's the Souke destiny. And this is the
fate of those who were born into the Hyuga.

74
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:45,013
Where's the usual
strong-willed Hiashi-sama?

75
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:50,561
This is totally different from the other important
things before. This can't be decided it so easily...

76
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,883
Hizashi... you...

77
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:07,629
Please have me go.

78
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:21,107
You have Neji... why do you choose to die for the Souke?

79
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,083
That's not true.

80
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:40,312
I have hated the Souke. To tell you the truth, I still hate it. That's
why I want to die to protect you as my brother, not as the Souke.

81
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:48,035
To do so is my first freedom that I can choose.

82
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:59,104
I have been showing only my ungraceful sides
to Neji. But I finally realized my own will.

83
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:04,083
Therefore, please tell Neji this...

84
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:09,087
I'm not going to die for the Souke.

85
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:17,713
But I choose to die by my own free will to protect
Neji... my brother... my family... and this Village.

86
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,618
You say its freedom to choose death with your own will?

87
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:39,389
Brother, I've always wanted to
go against the Hyuga's fate once.

88
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:45,978
I wanted to choose my own fate... That's all.

89
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:58,140
Overcome your fate, Neji. Your fate
is to be created by your own hands.

90
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,663
Father.

91
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:06,212
That is the truth.

92
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:11,062
I apologize.

93
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,485
Please raise your head.

94
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:42,075
Father... I still don't know whether a man's fate
is just to float on the fixed flow like the clouds.

95
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:49,720
Or if it can get into the flow that a man chooses to be on.

96
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:53,881
Either way, it may end up in the same place.

97
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,765
But when choosing the latter way to live,
people can work hard for the purpose of living.

98
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:06,695
And people who have it are the real strong ones.
I think I finally understood that in this battle.

99
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:13,360
Father, my purpose is only one thing...

100
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:19,681
I want to get stronger. Strong enough to lose to nobody.

101
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:23,316
That's what I think now.

102
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:30,686
Father, the birds fly’s well today... Fly as they feel well.

103
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,591
Noisy, isn't it?

104
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,551
Because that was a good battle.

105
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,510
That is true... but...

106
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,370
There’s no other match that is more
looked-forward to than the next match...

107
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:59,624
to the Shinobi-kashira and Daimyos
who will be requesting missions.

108
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:10,263
By the way, I didn't see him at the opening
ceremony. But he's already here, right?

109
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:17,081
We still can't find Sasuke.

110
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:19,480
There are also worries about Orochimaru.

111
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,396
Before people start to notice and
make a fit, we should disqualify him.

112
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:30,080
What're you guys doing? Start the next match already!

113
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,575
How long will you make us wait?!

114
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,403
It's going to be sunset soon!

115
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,368
What's going on with the next match? Did Sasuke come already?

116
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,574
Whats keeping him from coming? Is he not going to show up?

117
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:55,401
A wise man keeps away from danger. It may be a smart decision.

118
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:06,046
What are you guys talking about? He's definitely coming.

119
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:25,965
But what is he doing... you're gonna get disqualified soon.

120
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,997
There's no other choice.

121
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:33,474
Sasuke is disqualified.

122
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,761
Uchiha Sasuke is disqualified?

123
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,179
There's no other choice than that.

124
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:47,438
What are we going to do? If he
doesn't show up, our plan will be...

125
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,503
This isn't good.

126
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,114
Maybe then...

127
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:58,809
Where're you going, Gaara?

128
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,090
I'm going to verify my existence.

129
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:09,131
I wonder if Gaara actually killed him...

130
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,144
Sasuke, one more time.

131
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,802
What's up?

132
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:31,038
Releasing that much bad intention, you're
not hiding yourself at all.  Come on out.

133
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,233
So its you...

134
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:52,594
Hokage-dono, I want you to hold
on to disqualify Uchiha Sasuke.

135
00:16:54,265 --> 00:17:01,803
You may be right, but any Shinobi who doesn't value time
can't become a Chunin, even if he's a very skilled one.

136
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:09,586
There's no reason for us to wait for him if he doesn't
have a very clear and understandable reason to be late.

137
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:16,904
I see... then there's enough of a reason.

138
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:22,937
Most of Shinobi-kashira and daimyos, including
myself, came here to see the next match.

139
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm sure they will understand.

140
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,827
But...

141
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:40,392
After all, he's the survivor of the Uchiha. We, the Wind
country, would like to have our Gaara go against him.

142
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,956
Hokage sama.

143
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,360
There's no guarantee that Sasuke will come, but...

144
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:50,421
I understand.

145
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:55,732
I'll make an exception and hold this
match for later and wait for him.

146
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:01,193
Hokage-sama, are you really...

147
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,279
Tell the examiner.

148
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:14,377
But, it is really rare to hear you,
Kazekage-dono, to insist that much.

149
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:22,344
There's no other opponent than Uchiha to show
off my village's shinobi quality to the Daimyos.

150
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,820
It's a chance for us.

151
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,197
I understand.

152
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:38,564
Ladies and Gentleman.

153
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:43,187
One person for the next match still hasn't arrived yet.

154
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:48,989
Therefore we decided to postpone the
match, and start the match after that first.

155
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:54,658
What's he doing, Sasuke.

156
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:58,755
That's good. Sasuke-kun won't get disqualified.

157
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,322
Good.

158
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:11,339
Hey. That means my match is closer by one match.

159
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,980
Then, onto the next match. Kankuro
and Aburame Shino, come down here.

160
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,056
My match doesn't mean anything.

161
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:33,980
Besides, I don't want to show the mechanism I put
into my doll in front of the enemy before the plan...

162
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,196
Examiner, I forfeit.

163
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,223
What?

164
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:45,990
I forfeit. Continue onto the next match.

165
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:04,784
Due to Kankuro's forfeiture,
Aburame Shino wins without a fight.

166
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:23,972
You are?

167
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,194
It's my turn, right?

168
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,062
It seems you're eager to fight.

169
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:31,580
Alright. I'll start the next match.

170
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,871
Hey, the other one, come on down.

171
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:44,553
Hey, why the hell is she excited about the match by herself.
Plus, why is it always me getting the match plan changed?

172
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:46,526
Hey, Nara Shikamaru. I'm talking to you.

173
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:50,672
Shit... then I'm going to forfeit, too...

174
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:54,048
Alright, Shikamaru. Go for it!

175
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,260
Damn Naruto.

176
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,710
Go for it, Shikamaru!

177
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,641
It's a bit strange to see Shikamaru in the final round.

178
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:45,322
You're on fire, hot, excited! That's my teammate!

179
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,895
But he's looking up the sky and not concentrating.

180
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,080
What? It can be because he is so into the match!

181
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:54,591
Alright Shikamaru! Give the 16-combo and beat her up.

182
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:58,759

Clouds are good...
A Man With No Fighting Spirit

183
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,493
Ino, your cheer is scary.
