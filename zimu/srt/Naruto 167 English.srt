1
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:21,673
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:29,114
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,715
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:36,321
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:46,238
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:55,610
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,584 --> 00:01:06,391
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:15,868
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:20,998
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>When Egrets Flap Their Wings</i>

12
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:03,551
What's this?

13
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:05,482
Where does this water...?

14
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,586
What's the matter, Naruto?!

15
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,222
Get a hold of yourself, please!

16
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,063
Naruto!

17
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,798
They all look like they're having fun.

18
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:00,397
Naruto!

19
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,000
Naruto...

20
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,211
Hey, you jerk!...

21
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,390
This is... that lake from before...

22
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,366
Naruto...

23
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,328
I see...

24
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:33,162
The person who was calling my name
earlier was you, right, Chishima?

25
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,872
Are you hurt?

26
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,644
I should be asking you that, Chishima.

27
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,442
You shouldn't be moving
with that injury.

28
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:42,082
I'm fine.

29
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:44,744
More importantly,
we need to find Lady Toki.

30
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,116
Oh yeah, that's right...

31
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,915
Where the hell did that Moso go?

32
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:51,684
I'm right here...

33
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,356
Moso...!

34
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:55,829
Lady Toki!

35
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:01,301
Chishima, I'm sorry for having
deceived you for so long...

36
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:06,302
That's all right, I already had
a sense that maybe...

37
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,806
You guys know too many
of this land's secrets...

38
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:14,844
I'll have you guys embrace those secrets
as you plunge headfirst into hell...

39
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,951
Is that your real face?

40
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,854
My name is Hoki.

41
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,586
I'm a Wandering Ninja.

42
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:33,289
I'm not about to let you get in
the way of my taking this peaceful land,

43
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,336
which I have finally managed to snatch!

44
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:38,838
Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!

45
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,001
Chishima!

46
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:08,830
Chishima!

47
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,600
Please, hang in there!

48
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,369
Are you... all right?

49
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:20,346
I'm so relieved...

50
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,281
Chishima!

51
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,918
Lady Toki...

52
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,210
I have fond memories...

53
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,954
of playing here at this lake...

54
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,823
with you and Lord Sagi.

55
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:38,629
In those days,

56
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,999
the Land of Bird was tranquil,
gentle and warm...

57
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:49,674
Use your strength, Lady Toki...
to restore the Land of Birds...

58
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:52,142
to the way it was in those days...

59
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:54,937
Chishima...

60
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,812
Hang in there!

61
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:01,144
Naruto, I beg you...

62
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:06,889
help Lady Toki...
help my friend...

63
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:10,053
Sure thing.
If a Leaf Ninja promises something,

64
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,123
he will complete it to the very end.

65
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,826
Promise me...

66
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:22,073
You must...
you must... protect Lady Toki...

67
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,743
You have feelings for her, don't you?

68
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,915
That ramen... was delicious...

69
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,583
I'll treat you to some again...

70
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:41,056
Thank you... Naruto...

71
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,301
Chishima!

72
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:55,965
Chishima!

73
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,309
Chishima...!

74
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,079
That guy was nothing more

75
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:09,180
than just another
convenient servant, after all.

76
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,314
Shut up!

77
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,783
He loved the Land of Birds
with all his might...

78
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,129
Chishima, who staked his life trying
to protect the country he loved...

79
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:26,797
I will not... forgive you,
no matter what!

80
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,073
You may say that
you won't forgive me,

81
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:34,376
but what exactly do
you think you can do?!

82
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,113
Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!

83
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,192
Die!

84
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,042
How annoyingly persistent!

85
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,255
Gentle Fist!

86
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,569
That was careless,
Copy Ninja Kakashi Hatake...

87
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:34,898
The reputation of the Wandering Ninja
will be upgraded

88
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:38,309
if I take you, who possess
the Sharingan, down...

89
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,819
What...? A Substitution...

90
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,489
Sorry to disappoint you.

91
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,051
I don't need to use the Sharingan
on the likes of you...

92
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,696
This way!

93
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:01,698
Naruto!

94
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,899
If we follow this...

95
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,370
Yes, we should be able
to reach Naruto.

96
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:23,722
Unfortunately, I cannot allow you
to avengerthe blood of the fallen.

97
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,681
The least I can do for you,
out of charity,

98
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,228
is send you to the same place
your father and brother are.

99
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:30,627
I don't care.

100
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:34,596
Why don't you just kill me
in one stroke?

101
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,462
You know when to give up, huh?

102
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:44,001
They're all dead.
I'm the only one left in this world.

103
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,547
Now that I am unable to take revenge,

104
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,876
I have no more reason to live.

105
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,049
You're a courageous girl,
aren't you?

106
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:58,818
All right, I'll grant your wish.

107
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,960
Resign yourself!

108
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:15,867
<i>Wake up.</i>

109
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,844
<i>Save Toki... Save my little sister...</i>

110
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,345
<i>I entrusted the future of</i>
<i>the Land of Birds to my younger sister</i>

111
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:31,982
<i>and gave her the watch.</i>

112
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:36,294
<i>But Toki became obsessed</i>
<i>with her desire for revenge.</i>

113
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:40,092
<i>I, a dead soul, cannot change</i>
<i>my younger sister's heart</i>

114
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,998
<i>which is stalled in time.</i>

115
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:43,968
<i>I'm begging you,</i>

116
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:48,566
<i>please make my younger sister's time</i>
<i>begin to move again towards the future.</i>

117
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,809
<i>What was that just now?</i>

118
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:00,781
Die!

119
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:05,451
What?

120
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,123
Hold it!

121
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:19,602
What?

122
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,133
Hold it!

123
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:34,054
Naruto!

124
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,855
I met your elder brother in
a dream a little while ago.

125
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:40,722
Elder Brother?

126
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,093
It wasn't the wish of
your elder brother Sagi

127
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,690
that you avenge bis death.

128
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:50,299
He wanted to leave the care
of this land in your hands.

129
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:51,666
But...

130
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,396
For Chishima's sake too...

131
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,705
you must make this
Land of Bird a great country...

132
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,008
That's why you must live, Toki...

133
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:03,911
Naruto...

134
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:10,080
It doesn't make any difference to me.

135
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:12,785
The two of you are going
to die here in any case.

136
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:26,168
Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?

137
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:27,899
What...

138
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:32,575
But a person with an impure heart,
with a heart bent on revenge,

139
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,409
cannot govern this land.

140
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,916
The reason this was such
a wonderful country was because

141
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:43,423
Chishima and Sagi and Toki's hearts
were all connected.

142
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,651
Even if you use dirty tricks
to gain status,

143
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,525
you will never be able to control
the hearts of the people...

144
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,363
Speak for yourself, squirt!

145
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,727
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

146
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,405
You Leaf Village greenhorn!

147
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:08,676
I'll send you down into hell first
to meet up with the others!

148
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:12,149
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

149
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,192
- It ain't gonna be that easy!
- It ain't gonna be that easy!

150
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:24,394
- Then try to spot the real McCoy!
- Then try to spot the real McCoy!

151
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,056
What...!

152
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,792
Let's go!

153
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:51,084
- Damn, which is the real one?
- Damn, which is the real one?

154
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,968
Naruto, hang in there...

155
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,535
I wouldn't have thought the real McCoy
would come straight out

156
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,102
when using Shadow Clones...

157
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:16,078
I was hoping you'd let me
have some fun...

158
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,376
So that was your caliber,
after all, huh.

159
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:23,284
Those without power should
hurry up and die!

160
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:28,984
Better not underestimate me!
The battle is not yet won!

161
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,990
You impertinent little...!

162
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:38,596
Now!

163
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,601
U zu ma ki...

164
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,441
The real McCoy is...

165
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:45,673
Over here!

166
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,677
Uzumaki Barrage!

167
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,120
I did it!

168
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,413
Chishima!

169
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,027
Chishima...

170
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,556
Don't die, Chishima!

171
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,571
Don't... leave me... all alone!

172
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:31,446
Open your eyes...

173
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:33,925
Please!

174
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,680
Lady Toki...

175
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,450
Chishima...!

176
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,551
Lady Toki...

177
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:06,654
I'm so relieved!

178
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,394
Thank you, Naruto!

179
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:12,531
I was just carrying out my mission.

180
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:13,764
More importantly...

181
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,267
Make that guy pay dearly for
his crimes, okay.

182
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:21,166
Yes.

183
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:25,010
I'm sure that Sagi is happy
about this too.

184
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,746
You met... you met Elder Brother Sagi...

185
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,882
Yeah, in a dream.

186
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:34,117
But even if it was in a dream,

187
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,418
it doesn't change the fact that
he asked me to do something.

188
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,115
What did Elder Brother say to you?

189
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:43,591
Well, he said something about
starting up your time again.

190
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,560
My time?

191
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,925
He said he wanted you to forget
about things like revenge

192
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:50,833
and instead live for the future.

193
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,139
Elder Brother...

194
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:00,937
Hey!

195
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:03,516
Naruto...

196
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:06,952
Kakashi Sensei, Neji, Tenten!

197
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,387
Gimme a break...

198
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,957
I can't get paid my extra money
now that Moso,

199
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,333
the guy who signs the paycheck,
got nabbed...

200
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,563
Come on, resign yourself...

201
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,731
But...

202
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:30,469
It looks like the Wandering Ninja
are going to get a really stiff sentence.

203
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:34,945
Yeah... And Toki was finally able to
break the curse of seeking revenge...

204
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,382
Hey, it's gonna start!

205
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:41,014
Down on your knees!

206
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,921
Ohhh... wow...

207
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,799
I must apologize for having
deceived everyone

208
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,605
by using my brother's name fraudulently,

209
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,841
and claiming
the title of feudal lord.

210
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:09,846
In a case such as this,

211
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:13,717
it may well be proper to hand over
the title of feudal lord to someone else.

212
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,781
However, if you will forgive me,

213
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,382
I would like to ask you to
allow me to work

214
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,290
on behalf of Land of Birds
as your lord.

215
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:25,357
For my deceased father Owashi,
and brother Sagi...

216
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,366
And for my dear friend Chishima
who loves this country so dearly...

217
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:32,770
Lady Toki...

218
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,902
As long as there is breath in my body,

219
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,035
I would like to work positively
to rebuild this country.

220
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,911
She's doing an excellent job, isn't she?

221
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,505
Toki, awesome!

222
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,950
As you wish, Lady Toki...

223
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,421
It appears that
you all agree too, correct?

224
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,655
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

225
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,991
Thank you...

226
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:59,692
To Komei... for accepting me
as your feudal lord... to everyone...

227
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,458
And to the young Ninja who taught me

228
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:06,802
what it is that I should <i>really</i>
stake my life on...

229
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:08,665
You're embarrassing me...

230
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:13,271
Land of Birds

231
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:16,583
Please take the best of care
along the road now.

232
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:17,841
Fare thee well.

233
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,920
Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?

234
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,620
Thank you, Naruto.

235
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:26,284
Please come back to visit
again soon.

236
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:30,285
Sure, next time I'd love
to visit without a mission.

237
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:31,898
Goodbye.

238
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,297
Goodbye. Be well...

239
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,366
See you...

240
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:46,538
Toki... she was really kind
and gorgeous too, wasn't she?

241
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:49,045
I'm certain that the Land of Birds
will become a wonderful land again,

242
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:50,378
just like it was in the old days.

243
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,310
Yeah.

244
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:54,684
By the way, Naruto...
did you really meet Sagi's ghost?

245
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,882
You gotta be kidding.

246
00:19:56,957 --> 00:20:00,484
There's no such things as ghosts...
that was all in a dream.

247
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:03,428
I'm not so sure it was just a dream.

248
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:05,963
Wh-What the heck are you
talking about?!

249
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:10,392
Do you remember that Cursed Warrior
we cornered the very first time?

250
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:12,535
Uh, yeah.

251
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,869
Yeah, he was empty inside.

252
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,382
<i>Th This... ?

253
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,814
<i>The inside of it is empty.</i>

254
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:36,053
Yeah, but that was just sort
of gimmick, right?

255
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,528
Some kind of string or piece
of wire or something...

256
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:40,964
No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.

257
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,165
Now that you mention it,

258
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,205
you said there was no sign of life,
right, Neji?

259
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,176
Yeah... I didn't feel a speck of life
from that Cursed Warrior.

260
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,272
In other words, there was
a ghost there.

261
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,484
So that was a real ghost, after all?!

262
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,351
Calm down, Naruto.

263
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,579
That's not true...
That's not true!

264
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:06,649
Tell me that's not true!

265
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:34,385
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

266
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:38,186
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

267
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:40,792
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

268
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,795
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

269
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:47,857
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

270
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,436
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

271
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:53,695
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

272
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:55,571
<i>The images.</i>

273
00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:02,581
<i>It probably will not end</i>

274
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:08,977
<i>It probably will not end</i>

275
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:13,827
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

276
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:16,853
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

277
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,897
<i>Running freely</i>

278
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:23,527
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

279
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,629
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

280
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:29,607
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

281
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,213
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

282
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,484
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

283
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:42,989
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

284
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:51,725
- Pork!
- Chicken!

285
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,266
- Beef!
- What, is this a guessing game?

286
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,255
- Bean sprouts!
- Spinach!

287
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:55,858
- Green onions!
- I got it! It's Stir fried Beef & Vegetables!

288
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:56,730
- Egg!
- Nori!

289
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:57,428
Seaweed!

290
00:22:57,504 --> 00:22:59,472
Umm... Stir fried Beef, vegetable,
and seaweed in egg saut?!

291
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,437
- Menma!
- Char siu!

292
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:00,996
Naruto!

293
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:03,008
I got it, ramen!
It's ramen, isn't it?!

294
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:03,667
Wrong answer!

295
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:04,869
Sakura, you're so slow to get it!

296
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:06,605
You should know
if we've said it this far.

297
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,247
Miso tonkotsu ramen with char siu
and eggs on top.

298
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,078
Isn't that right?!

299
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,845
Like heck I'd get it, Cha!

300
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:15,551
Next time:
"Mix It! Stretch it! Boil it up!
Burn Copper Pot! Burn!
