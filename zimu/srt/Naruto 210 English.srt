00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:14,346
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:34,100
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:39,971
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:46,072
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:58,359
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:05,333
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:17,972
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:24,381
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:29,584
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:49,471
<i>The Bewildering Forest</i>

12
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,016
Hey kids, get out of here
if you don't wanna get hurt.

13
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,448
Better not think lightly of me!

14
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:05,655
I'm not gonna hand this guy over,
no matter what!

15
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:07,961
Ninja Dropouts...

16
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,261
It's not gonna end up with
you just getting hurt.

17
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,960
You're gonna get killed.

18
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,296
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

19
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:37,824
Ninja Art: Blood Rain.

20
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,225
Todoroki!

21
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:48,896
Damn!

22
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:09,120
My Jutsu isn't Ninjutsu.

23
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,025
It's Killer Jutsu.

24
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,662
Sakura!

25
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,679
Lee, are you all right?

26
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:37,345
Yeah, just barely.
More importantly, where's Naruto?

27
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,119
Is everybody safe?

28
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:46,659
Yes. However, Commander Todoroki
is nowhere to be seen!

29
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,888
What was that?!

30
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,189
Naruto...

31
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,858
Naruto...

32
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:04,275
Die!

33
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,282
Damn! Let go, you jerk!

34
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:11,985
Naruto!

35
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,530
Damn!

36
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:10,003
Father! Mother!

37
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,084
Akio!

38
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:27,795
Akio!

39
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,853
What a shame...

40
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:01,129
You're not getting back
with your comrades.

41
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:21,977
Todoroki! Gantetsu!

42
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,347
Are you all right?!

43
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,011
Y Yeah... We're fine.

44
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,856
What are we going to do now?

45
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,787
We've gotten separated from
Sakura and Bushy Brows...

46
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:35,162
There isn't any question in my mind.

47
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,994
It's my mission to deliver
this guy to the capital.

48
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,334
But the ship's been destroyed, and...

49
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:56,416
Those guys are pursuing us!

50
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,180
What are you doing?!

51
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,248
If they're gonna steal this guy
away from us anyway,

52
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:06,489
it would be better to
take care of him right here!

53
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:11,088
What do you mean take care of him...?

54
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,798
Even if we delivered him the capital,

55
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:15,029
it's certain that
he'll be sentenced to death...

56
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:16,934
Therefore...

57
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,368
Rather than having them
take him away, it would be better to...!

58
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:23,009
It's not set in stone that
they'll be able to take him away!

59
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,209
Let's go!

60
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,442
Your mission is to guard this guy, right?

61
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,417
That's exactly what my mission is too!

62
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:47,096
If you so much as try anything,
your head's gonna roll!

63
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,604
Run!

64
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,190
We'll be fine...
now that we've come this far...

65
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,288
Looks like we've totally lost them.

66
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:20,462
We've gone pretty deep
into the forest, haven't we?

67
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,695
I can get our bearings from
the position of the moon.

68
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,365
It's too dangerous to go back
to the river.

69
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:29,642
We'll continue straight through
this forest to the capital.

70
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:34,511
Because it's my mission.

71
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:36,879
Are you sure it'll be okay?

72
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,651
What do you mean?

73
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:43,251
You said earlier you were going
to finish this guy off, right?

74
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,593
I was talking about
a worst case scenario.

75
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,192
Got it...
Well then, let's get moving.

76
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,464
<i>I wonder if Sakura is all right...</i>

77
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,702
Naruto...

78
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,309
It's Naruto...
He's gonna be just fine.

79
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:07,646
Yeah...

80
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,484
So let's hurry up and link up with him!

81
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,280
Lee!

82
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,385
I detect something strange...

83
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:18,559
Where...?

84
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,389
Up above!

85
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:40,311
Lee!

86
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:44,044
Let's follow him!
The enemy might have captured Naruto!

87
00:09:58,533 --> 00:09:59,591
What's the matter?

88
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:04,337
We're walking in the direction
of the moon, right...?

89
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,865
Then why is the moon following us?

90
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,468
That's strange...

91
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:19,547
What's going on...?

92
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:21,616
The Forest of Bewilderment...

93
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:26,425
Once you get lost you can
never find you way out again.

94
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,351
He talked...

95
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,923
You are in custody.
You're not allowed to talk!

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,558
Wait a second!

97
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,830
The Forest of Bewilderment...

98
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,804
You know something about this place?

99
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:39,867
What do you know? Tell us!

100
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:44,068
The Ninja Dropouts have
a hide out in this forest.

101
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:45,401
What was that?!

102
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,377
So we were escorting you
through Ninja Dropout territory?!

103
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:55,423
This forest is perfect for a hide out.

104
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,690
The fog, the winds that
sweep through the forest,

105
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,988
the extreme magnetic fields...

106
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,456
They all make a person lose
their sense of direction.

107
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,357
A person finding himself in
this forest for the first time

108
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,024
will never find his way out.

109
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,761
I don't believe that...

110
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,270
There's no way we won't find
our way out...?

111
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,365
You guys won't.

112
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,338
Huh?

113
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,136
But for me, a member of
the Ninja Dropouts...

114
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,270
the outcome will be different.

115
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:29,889
I will...

116
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:33,486
I will guide you through this forest.

117
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:37,324
Yeah, that's right...

118
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,429
For you, a Ninja Dropout,
this forest is like your backyard, right?

119
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,636
Okay then, let's have you guide us!

120
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,306
Are you some kind of idiot?!

121
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:48,233
It's true...

122
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,470
The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts
showed earlier on

123
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,844
makes sense if you think
that this is their garden...

124
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,449
And I'll believe you when you say
you have a hide out here.

125
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,919
Then even more so...

126
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:01,182
Even more so, it's a no!

127
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,319
Huh?

128
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:03,713
Don't you get it?

129
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,089
This guy is gonna pretend to
be guiding us out of the forest

130
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,129
but will actually be taking us
to the hide out.

131
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,026
Todoroki...

132
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,890
This is an emergency situation...

133
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,629
If we don't kill him, we'll be killed.

134
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,238
W Wait a minute!

135
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:22,466
Nobody's gonna care... if this guy dies!

136
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,347
Todoroki!

137
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:38,481
What's that...?

138
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,090
I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts
had stolen up to now...

139
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,734
So I was tortured...

140
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,431
Those guys don't want to rescue me...

141
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,337
They just want to get that money
back from me.

142
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,139
Once they have the money back,
those guys will kill me too.

143
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:03,049
Do you really think I'll believe that?

144
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,446
Wait a second!

145
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,049
The Ninja Dropouts hide out is
here in this forest, right...?

146
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,522
Which means it's like
a backyard to them too,

147
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,820
just like it is for Gantetsu...

148
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:13,917
Which means that...

149
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:15,626
Which means that what?

150
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:22,467
Well, since we've trespassed
into their garden

151
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,563
it's likely that the Ninja Dropouts
will come after us

152
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,302
whether Gantetsu's
betrayed them or not...

153
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,242
So I think our only option is to
pin our hopes on this guy...

154
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:37,910
Am I wrong?

155
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,650
Hey, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

156
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,590
Yeah, everything's fine.

157
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,861
Those guys won't figure out
this kind of circuitous route.

158
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,627
<i>Can we really trust this guy... ?

159
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:51,549
What?!

160
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:57,998
I'm used to it's venom. It's nothing.

161
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,660
Are you really gonna be all right?

162
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:03,901
Yeah...

163
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,455
Hey!

164
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:30,058
What's the matter?

165
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,509
No way!

166
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,688
You fell for it. You fell for it!

167
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:08,459
Here it comes!

168
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:13,972
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!

169
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,607
Die!

170
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,724
You're the one who fell for it!

171
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:41,329
I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.

172
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,736
What was that?!

173
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:44,696
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

174
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,634
Now it's my turn!

175
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,208
Rasengan!

176
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,335
I'm gonna strike you down!

177
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:27,210
Don't think it's gonna be that
easy to strike me down!

178
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,175
Like I'll let you get away!

179
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,750
Naruto!

180
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,751
That guy! Trying to get away, huh!

181
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:02,740
What are you doing?

182
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:17,225
Th That sound is...

183
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,307
What?!

184
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,512
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

185
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,547
Rasengan!

186
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:55,531
Thanks to you we made it... Gantetsu.

187
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,714
What's with you guys?

188
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,314
They want to fight, it seems.

189
00:19:54,228 --> 00:20:00,133
<i>I won't... I won't be fooled.</i>
<i>You...you...</i>

190
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,933
We'll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.

191
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,291
Todoroki!

192
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,841
Stop it, Todoroki!

193
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:50,778
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?

194
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,313
This guy...

195
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,845
There's no way I'll forgive this guy!

196
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,547
What are you talking about?!

197
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,426
This guy...

198
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:06,094
This guy killed my family...
he killed my little brother!

199
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,568
Wh What was that...?

200
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,063
Gantetsu...

201
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:23,847
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

202
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:30,187
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

203
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:39,997
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

204
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:44,595
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

205
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:49,541
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

206
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,411
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

207
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:59,385
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

208
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:03,617
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

209
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:08,094
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

210
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

211
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,403
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

212
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:24,672
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

213
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:28,806
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

214
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:33,684
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

215
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:38,381
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

216
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:44,523
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

217
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,638
It's true that Gantetsu may be evil,

218
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,370
but how is taking revenge out
on him going to change things?!

219
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,374
Isn't our mission to take Gantetsu
to the capital?

220
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,076
And I... I don't think that
he's an evil person.

221
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:10,550
Anyway, you leave me
no choice if you won't listen.

222
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:14,021
I'll stop you with all my strength!

223
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:17,028
Next time: " Memory of Flames
