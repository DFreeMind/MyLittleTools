that you want to be with me.>.

49
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,525
It is in order to snow?

50
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,404
Happening!

51
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:16,989
I must wait for one to me similar what …

52
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,200
I pray.

53
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,996
You ask me to come for being able to be with me

54
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,457
It is in order to snow.... Not!

55
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,750
but …

56
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,046

57
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,673
or something of the sort.>.?

58
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,718
I pray.

59
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,638
You ask me to come for being able to be with me

60
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,100
It is in order to snow.... Not!

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,938
Must explode qualcos' other? Not creed.

62
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,489
Happening!

63
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,366

64
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,204
Or you hide me qualche.cosa?

65
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,416
Of… of.... Of that what speeches?

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,504
It is  ours it must occupy you to us, Kakashi-sensei!

67
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,380
To. All-all-allora…

68
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,466
Eaten, eaten!

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,051
It goes well.

70
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,803
Then I cannot refuse this meal.

71
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:22,971
I pray.

72
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,640
The pig is our specialty.

73
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,361
I do not see the hour to taste this pranzetto.

74
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,366
Sasuke-kun!

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,703
Ino, ugly stronza!

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,705
-  not to push! I do not see nothing!

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,167
I have eaten indeed well. It was delicious.

78
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,168
That fast!

79
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,629
There is something that does not go?

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,674
Uhm.... Nothing…

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,266
He is  truly incredible!

82
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,233
Mmmm, in such case, I  to us  will think!

83
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,527
But that you count to make?

84
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,279
In this case…

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,198
I  to us  will think!

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,701
I am asking like you will make to you, idiot!

87
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,914
You have a plan, Sakura-chan?

88
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,832
Then…

89
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,336
We must pedinarlo. E' the only way. Sooner or later it will remove the mask!

90
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,006
Like six intelligent Sasuke-kun! The six best one!

91
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,758
But if he is a deficient one.>.!

92
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,801
Which thing you have said?

93
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,804
N-nn.. nothing

94
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,900
But that ago Kakashi-sensei!?

95
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,610
You are zitto, incosciente.

96
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,904
We have been discoveries!

97
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,948
Naruto, a six idiot! If it has seen to us, is for guilt yours!

98
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,909
Mine is not guilt!

99
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,247
The film!?

100
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,543
I must buy endured a ticket!!

101
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,170
It is  disappeared!

102
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,338
We follow it.

103
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,547
S ì!

104
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,178
Dov' is!?

105
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,056
Merda, is disappeared.

106
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,100
From where it is passed?

107
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,102
Which thing fairies?

108
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,731
It has qualche.cosa to that to see with me?

109
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,149
Not…

110
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,159
Ehi, because we are made to discover?

111
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,120
It can  be because we were too much numerous.

112
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,625
If one hides to us correctly, imports how many little we are.

113
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,003
You have forgotten your training, Sakura-chan?

114
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,588
Better if you are zitto!

115
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,258
To follow it would be a good training.

116
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,677
We go now. we divide ourselves.

117
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:10,305
S ì, you have reason. Lasciamo Naruto to go for first.

118
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,807
Eh?

119
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,354
Here that Junko said…

120
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,233
"I am in order to lose your traces."

121
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,591
It is scappato to me.

122
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,593
As usual, vigliacco.

123
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,386
That idiot race.>.

124
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,804
Bastard…

125
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:06,612
But that ago Kakashi-sensei? E' l ì  from cos ì  a lot.>.

126
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,531
It is not possible!

127
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,138
Sasuke-kun! Then?

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,266
E' scappato to me.

129
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,654
We go!

130
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,782
The mission today is to work in one small farm.

131
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,326
The mission is not for nothing amusing.

132
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,120
I will make  all those that I can

133
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,498
In order to see the face of Kakashi-sensei!

134
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,921
Which thing is? You have a less enthusiastic air of the usual.

135
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,006

You tighten to me between your arms tenderly and…

153
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:20,913

Then, this is the rivincita one that we wait for from 3 years?

It will be a beautiful combat!

Imbecille! Who would make one similar what?

192
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:26,163
If  I will be able  to make it, I will make  it  furtively, in the shadow, and with astuteness.

193
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,499

00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,782

00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:08,664
I have put in the food one powder that da' an interminable sob.

00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:13,460
Your sob will not be stopped, and you will not be able to breathe more correctly. Then morirai.

206
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,964
This is the dead women who are up to you.

00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,596
Which thing does not go? You have not touched yours cotolette.

A plan?

220
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,576
I have understood.... you have had truly one good idea, Sasuke.

221
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,995
Of habit the persons remove the mask here.

222
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,331
Sure, they are a Ninja of talent.

223
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,880

224
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,632
It is  one of my inventions.

225
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:46,678
There is a needle poisoned with a pozione that provokes uncontrollable risata.

226
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,276
To die to laugh…

227

00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,314
I have not ended with you, Hatake Kakashi!

255
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,067
We have been fortunate in order to have of the dresses of reciprocation.

256
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,318
They are of agreement with you.

257
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,821
But I ask who has taken them.

258
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,368

Sasuke-kun, honestly, also I…

263

In this case, it is our last possibility!

264
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,762
Our last possibility?

265
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,597
But this …

266
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,976
You have not understood? They are of the estates from Ninja!

267
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,270
Where you have found to them?

268
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,897
Not not not.... not fairies attention to the details.

269
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,190
What you count to make?

270
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,195
To remove its mask, with the force!

271
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,119

272
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,120

Of that what speeches? We are only of the Ninja ordinary…

276
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,675
It is not that we want to see what you hide under the mask…

277
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,553
Idiot! Better if he does not speak!

278
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:15,929
