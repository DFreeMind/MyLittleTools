44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,592
My arms burn…

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,221
I could not never have imagined much suffering.

46
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,222
Sarutobi.

47
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,808
Or better, the Third Hokage…

48
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,768
Its last painful maledizione has inflicted you.

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,147
We do not lose time in useless to chiacchiere. Six successful one to find that person?

50
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,861
She seems that that person finds itself to Tanzaku-gai.

51
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,822
Tanzaku-gai…

52
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,493
Optimal.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,957
However, that person is also always one of the leggendari Sannin.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,957
Sannin: Ninja Leggendari

55
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,209
It will not be much easy one…

56
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,841
A miraculous cure is not much easy one to find.

57
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,187
It watches.

58
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,942
E' the same one. E' this the crucial point?

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,405
They are sure that you were one of that came sgridato for the concentration lack.

60
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,283
I do not understand what there enters now.

61
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,577
It watches this sheet of paper.

62
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,122
I have seen.

63
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,918
Well. Now it of new watches.

64
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,971
What I must see?

65
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:27,142
We see, would not have to be much difficult one to explain…

66
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:32,314
When you have observed the paper piece white woman, six successful one to perceive all the sheet?

67
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,941
Probably.

68
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,985
Now instead what focuses your look?

69
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,156
Sure on the sign in the center.

70
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,953
When a person observes something of white man…

71
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,915
She does not succeed to focus the look, cos ì  its eyes watch everywhere.

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,173
But if you put a sign in means, that person will concentrate itself in that point.

73
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,677
Called E' focalization in a point.

74
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,180
When you succeed to concentrate to you, your mind becomes stable…

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,308
Only then you can rilasciare the enormous one to be able inner.

76
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,939
When you have made that hole in the caucciù ball…

77
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,819
… you have had spasmodically to accumulate all the your Chakra in the right hand.

78
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,112
! !

79
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,323
If pits concentrated you would have made little hard work to you…

80
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,661
But it is difficult to concentrate itself without some type of sign.

81
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,164
This is how much. It listens To Me, Naruto.

82
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,210
When you have intention of rilasciare the Chakra from the palm of your right hand…

83
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,089
It tries to concentrate to you carefully on that point.

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,341
Concentration…

85
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,220
It goes well!  I will make!

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,858
Concentration!

90
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,833
I do not succeed to us.

91
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,877
I must make to explode it.

92
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,009

93
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,447

Concentration…

96
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,506
Concentration…

97
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,222
Nothing to make.

98
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,527
Eternal damnation…

99
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,906
What I must make in order to concentrate to me?

100
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,050
You are cursed, Sarutobi!

101
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,785
Later. I return in city in order to collect other information.

102
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,454

103
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,915

104
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey Hey!

105
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,673
It waits for! You do not have time in order to play to ball with your student?

106
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,969

107
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,684

Okay, I have taken it.

00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,482
We look at ourselves after.

110
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:34,032
We forget ourselves about Ero-Sennin. I must work hard mine on behalf.

111
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,203
Naruto.

112
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:42,040
You must succeed to carry out this part of the training alone.

113
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,002
You have the potentialities in order to become like the Fourth Hokage.

114
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,087
You can make it us.

115
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,636
I have not never seen it.

116
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,430
It goes well…

117
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,056

I can offer them from drink.

121
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,736
Not there is need.

122
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,113
Lately I have gained one hazard fortune playing…

123
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,032

Inasmuch as it was losing ugly…

128
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,585
It has preferred to change air.

129
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,420
Where it has gone?

130
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,507

I have a bad prefeeling.

156
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,426
I know some things Tsunade-sama care.

157
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,262
After all also I am a doctor like she.

158
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:05,225
Nowadays it is normal school that is at least a member of the medical square in every mission…

159
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,606
But she has been she it before to which this brilliant idea has come and it has proposed it to the council.

160
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,650
Considered E' one miliare stone of our history.

161
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:19,239
What you would happen in battle if not there were a doctor to cure the other members of the team?

162
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,075
The answer is obvious.

163
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,539
The survivors of the war of Amato…

164
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,335
… they brought back important considerations a lot.

165
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:36,256
Thanks above all to the innumerevoli victims fallen on the field.

166
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:42,471
When a person loses something, only then account of its importance becomes.

167
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:50,729
She was then that the medical specialist of the leggendari Sannin partor ì  this idea…

168
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,983
Because of the victims.

169
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,990
He does not work…

170
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,244
Still… I must concentrate itself more.

171
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,831
Concentration… Concentration…

172
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,668

Well, well…

180
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,761
It seems that from some part there is a girl who is thinking to me.

181
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,933
Tsunade-sama, aspects please!

182
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:15,272
What happens? Tsunade-sama never is not capitato that you have gained cos ì  many moneies…

183
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,900
But not seemed for nothing content.

184
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,110
This city…

185
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,821
There is something that does not go.

186
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,157
Sbrigati. Ce n' we go.

187
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,868
What? But this is one city for tourists.

188
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,537
We would have at least to see the castle!

189
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,332
It goes well. A visit and then ce n' we go.

190
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,209
Waited for… Tsunade-sama!

191
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,837
Orochimaru-sama.

192
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,341
We try to end this mission quickly…

193
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,844
Also to cost of having to use the force.

194
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,686
I must succeed to us…

195
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,231
Ahi!

196
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,690
Ahia!

197
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,652
I do not succeed more in rilasciare the Chakra with this pain…

198
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,906
It must have arrived to its limit.

199
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,792
Just little…

200
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,628
I must be rested for a po '.

201
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,459
Returned here!

202
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,503
The lesson is still not finished.

203
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,716
Race of idiots!

204
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,889
But it is possible…

205
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,558
Possible E' that you never do not succeed to concentrate to you?

206
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:18,312
You will not never succeed to become at this rate of the good ones ninja.

207
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,481
We cannot at all always remain seated on the benches…

208
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,066
Just, Akamaru?

209
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,196
I have hunger…

210
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,823
Sensei… Sbrigati with this lecture…

211
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,244
Children!

212
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:38,874
We will make one integrating lesson in order to improve your concentration!

213
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,216
What is?

214
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,343
What you see…

215
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,553
E' an ancient tradition of the ninja of Konoha…

216
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,805
Servants in order to learn to concentrate itself.

217
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,061
You must concentrate all your energy on that leaf…

218
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,938
Therefore pasted your Chakra.

219
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,815
E' a method much ancient one…

220
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,361
But it is the better way in order to increase your abilities to concentration.

221
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,991
Only who succeeds to concentrate itself will be able well to become Bravo ninja.

222
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,370
This is also the origin of the symbol of Konoha on the coprifronte.

223
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,370
Konoha: Leaf

224
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,455
To me it seems a bale…

225
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,042
You have invented this history in order to try to motivate to us?

226
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,711
History is not one! True E' all!

227
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,841
A Ninja will not never become the best one only why it succeeds to concentrate itself.

228
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,636
Bravo ninja second me, must be only much fort.

229
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,221
, you have reason.

230
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,556
That stupid history…

231
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,393
We look at ourselves, Sensei!

232
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,104
Hey! Waited for!

233
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:42,896
I do not have time to lose!

234
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,314
That loss of time!

235
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:49,152
Waited for! Ungrateful stupiden!

236
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,533
E' the same thing.

237
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:01,415
If you had only given straight more to the words than Iruka-sensei.

238
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,126
They are just an idiot.

239
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:11,341
I will not improve  here sure being some to me to piagnucolare.

240
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,100
Ok! I will succeed  to us. Of they are sure!

241
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,942
Concentration. Concentration…

242
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,904
Concentration!

243
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:34,948
Wow!

244
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,994
The castle of Tanzaku is truly impressive!

245
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,624
I understand why one of beautifulst is considered of our nation.

246
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,959
You stop it with chiacchiere.

247
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,086
Now we go ourselves some from here.

248
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,717
Tsunade-sama, why we do not give one look more give near. The entrance is free.

249
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,639
Tsunade-sama?

250
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,770
What is… this feeling?

251
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:40,931
Now!

252
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,595
That boy…

253
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,557
He has accumulated cos ì  much Chakra in its hand to burn itself…

254
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,811
He succeeds to astonish every day more to me!

255
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,318
Burst E'…

256
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,863

We begin endured with the third phase…

258

You must still wait for a po '.

259
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,204
Come E' the moment to meet Tsunade.

260
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,800
