1
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,935
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:21,531
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:26,371
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,642
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,848
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,223
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,597
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:49,192
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,570
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:55,573
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,941
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,410
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:08,283
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,024
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:14,356
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:19,228
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,493
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,035
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:27,470
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:47,450
<i>A Clash of Fate.</i>
<i>You Can't Bring Me Down!</i>

21
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,690
What incredible Chakra...
It's making my skin tingle.

22
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,101
My nose too...

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,702
Mizuki...

24
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:09,574
What's the matter?
Aren't you coming?

25
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:12,341
You jerk...!

26
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:13,946
Hey, Naruto!

27
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:14,983
Stop that!

28
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:19,421
You idiot.

29
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,494
Naruto!

30
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:26,961
Hey, hey.

31
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,967
Should you really be worrying
about others right now?

32
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,033
<i>He's fast!</i>

33
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:38,172
<i>And what's more, such power...</i>

34
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,009
So this is the power Lord Orochimaru
was talking about...

35
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:49,117
Amazing... It's almost scary...

36
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,286
Don't you agree, Iruka?

37
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,825
Mizuki, please stop.

38
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,396
Please!

39
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:06,895
Tsubaki...

40
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't care what happens
to me...

41
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,572
I just don't want you to
commit any more crimes.

42
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:14,978
Please!

43
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:17,645
Return to the village.

44
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:25,116
Tsubaki... If you care that much
about me,

45
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,084
then you could at least
be useful to me!

46
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:31,121
Tsubaki...!

47
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,202
<i>What?!</i>

48
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,997
You're so slow.

49
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,802
Iruka Sensei...!

50
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,337
Damn!

51
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:49,412
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

52
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,553
Hasty as always, huh...

53
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,921
You sure haven't made
any progress, have you?

54
00:03:58,924 --> 00:03:59,856
He vanished!

55
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:03,153
He didn't vanish.
He's just fast.

56
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,458
<i>That guy's been accelerating since earlier</i>
<i>and moving into our blind spots...</i>

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,689
<i>In that case...</i>

58
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:12,960
Everybody, better be very aware
of your surroundings!

59
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,336
I call it
Uzumaki Whirpool Formation!

60
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,269
- Right!
- Right!

61
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,444
I see...

62
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,647
Even an idiot like him comes up
with an idea once in a while.

63
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:28,876
In that case...

64
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:32,421
I want to watch you experience
even deeper despair...

65
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,789
Despair that's equal to that wisdom
you've managed to muster!

66
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:35,986
There he is!

67
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:37,221
I see him!

68
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,221
It's not that you saw me.

69
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,323
I'm going out of my way
to show myself to you.

70
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,071
There!

71
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,279
Damn... Even though I can see him,
I'm unable to land any blows.

72
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:04,314
I'm telling you, I'm not foreseeing
your movements.

73
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,682
You're just sluggish.

74
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,524
Oww...

75
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,860
Hey, serves you right.

76
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,067
You demon fox.

77
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,441
Don't be so delighted in such
a big way.

78
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,077
You'll now get a taste of
the same agony I have endured.

79
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:37,951
Starting now, right, Naruto?

80
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:42,258
There's still much more
to come!

81
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,335
Stop that, Mizuki!
Don't lay your hands on Naruto!

82
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:54,439
Shut up, Iruka!

83
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:58,543
Do you have any idea how much
I've been waiting for this moment?

84
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,237
I've been waiting for this day
ever since then.

85
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,807
For this time of revenge.

86
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,644
I will use this power of mine

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,188
and take my own good time
to crush each of you, one at a time.

88
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:14,590
Come on, stand up, Iruka.
I'll start by killing this guy.

89
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,520
Mizuki...!

90
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,654
There you go.
That's good!

91
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:22,362
Come on!

92
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,528
You are pathetic.

93
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:30,265
There's a world of difference
between us, isn't there?

94
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,946
I've gotten my hands on
this extreme body

95
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,609
and it is your fate
to die wretchedly.

96
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:41,552
What do you mean,
"extreme body"?

97
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,278
When your power depends
on potions,

98
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:46,586
it's not true power!

99
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,752
That sounds just like
the half-baked guy you are...

100
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,654
In that case, go ahead
and try winning...

101
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,666
Using that real power
you're talking about!

102
00:06:57,736 --> 00:07:00,330
I'm different from you.
You're gonna live out your life...

103
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,670
as some lowly teacher who never thinks
about getting ahead in life,

104
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,574
who only gets used by the village
in whatever way they see fit.

105
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:10,004
How do you like... this power...
and the way I carry myself?!

106
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:12,981
Even if you trained
a hundred years,

107
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,815
you'll never be able
to earn it!

108
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,750
I'm not gonna stop here!

109
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm still gonna get much
much stronger...

110
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,856
I'll get Orochimaru to share
his Hidden Jutsu with me.

111
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,262
Do you really think that will happen?

112
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,499
I'm getting tired of you
playing the martyr.

113
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,309
I think it's about time
to end this.

114
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,141
Isn't this nostalgic...?

115
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:45,642
This time, I'll get you for sure.

116
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,950
So prepare yourself.

117
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,202
Naruto!

118
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:13,903
You jerk! Don't you dare lay
your hands on Iruka Sensei!

119
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:21,780
This is really something!

120
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:25,790
Every little thing is exactly the same
as it was that other time.

121
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:31,754
But I've changed.

122
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,989
The reason for my defeat
that time...

123
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:39,401
was that I let my guard down
to the demon fox that you are.

124
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,581
Wh What's that?!

125
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,777
I won't let my guard down again.

126
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,881
I'll call upon all my strength
to beat you down!

127
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:03,083
Bring it on!

128
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:11,668
I'm sorry... both of you...

129
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,074
Choji!

130
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:28,179
<i>Damn... If only I had a little more</i>
<i>information about those guys...</i>

131
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:35,184
Elder Brother...
My body feels lighter.

132
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:39,358
Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter,
doesn't it?

133
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,825
Okay, time for clobbering...

134
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,095
Yeah! Clobbering!

135
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:49,402
<i>There they come.</i>

136
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:52,876
Damn it!

137
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,178
Huh?

138
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,010
What the hell is this?!

139
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,216
M My body...

140
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,353
Doesn't move...!

141
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,690
Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?

142
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:13,628
Looks like I made it in time.

143
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,164
Good work!
Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!

144
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:21,136
Leave the rest to me!

145
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,404
The F Fifth Hokage!

146
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:27,440
No way...
Lady Hokage... in person?!

147
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,069
Lady Tsunade.

148
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,983
I'm sorry I found out
about this so late.

149
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,320
But I wouldn't have imagined

150
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,154
that these guys were
hanging out with Mizuki...

151
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:43,087
Fifth Hokage!

152
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:44,996
We are saved...!

153
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,062
Uh... uh... Elder Brother...

154
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:53,263
Oh... Oh...

155
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,297
Well, we run into each other
in unusual places, don't we,

156
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,241
Fujin and Raijin?

157
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,914
T Tsunade...

158
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:07,948
Let me ask what
you're doing here.

159
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:18,561
Powerful.

160
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,998
More like, scary.

161
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:25,196
Now then, is there something
you want to say?

162
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,672
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

163
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,173
Please forgive me.
We'll never do it again!

164
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:35,612
So you guys went with Mizuki
because he told you that

165
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:39,208
you'd be able to eat something good
at Orochimaru's place?

166
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,119
- I'm, I'm sorry.
- I'm, I'm sorry.

167
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:45,350
No way we could stand up to guys on the
same level as the Three Legendary Ninja.

168
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,852
But I wonder what happened
between them the past...

169
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,223
to make those two that scared.

170
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:51,888
No thanks. I don't even want
to imagine what it might be.

171
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,755
Gimme a break.
Falling for such an obvious bait!

172
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,029
Mizuki has apparently gone
into those mountains up ahead.

173
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,566
Naruto and Iruka are probably
with him...

174
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:05,968
You guys come along
after recuperating a little.

175
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:08,406
Huh... wait a minute.

176
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,775
What are we going to do
with these two guys?

177
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,645
Huh? You don't need
to worry about that...

178
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,779
More importantly, I can't let them
cause any more trouble.

179
00:12:17,723 --> 00:12:20,419
I've decided to make these guys
go home on their own.

180
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:25,122
Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume
you understand this already,

181
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,791
but if you're even one minute late
you're not getting any dinner.

182
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,600
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

183
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:33,237
We can't be doing this, Raijin.

184
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:35,273
Let's hurry back to the institution.

185
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,374
Elder Brother, dinner, right?!

186
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:38,473
Dinner!

187
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:43,443
- Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner...
- Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner...

188
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,447
Amazing...
what incredible speed.

189
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,013
It's very important for
a person to eat, after all.

190
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:52,514
That's just you.

191
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:06,169
Damn! His power is
even greater than earlier!

192
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:14,136
<i>But I can't let him</i>
<i>take me down.</i>

193
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:17,409
<i>This guy may have a lead</i>
<i>to Sasuke's whereabouts.</i>

194
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:18,881
Naruto!

195
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:21,085
Iruka, are you all right?

196
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,082
Yes...

197
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,048
Did you notice?

198
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,285
What?

199
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,588
Although that jerk's power
has increased multifold,

200
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,754
the sharpness of his movements
is diminishing.

201
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:32,588
Huh?

202
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,162
Did he transfer the Chakra
he was using for speed, to power?

203
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,301
I don't really know that, but...

204
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:43,164
<i>That's quite a heavy burden</i>
<i>for Naruto to bear alone.</i>

205
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,838
<i>But if that guy's speed</i>
<i>has diminished,</i>

206
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,708
<i>there might be a chance to win.</i>

207
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,616
<i>All right... You hang in there</i>
<i>a little bit more, Naruto!</i>

208
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,380
How about this,
you little brat?

209
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,914
Do you like the power of this body
that Lord Orochimaru gave me!

210
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:02,422
I'll tear you apart.

211
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:07,189
Where the hell is he...?

212
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,497
That Orochimaru...
Where is he?

213
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,939
Why would I tell a little brat
like you that kind of thing?

214
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,901
He wasn't in
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

215
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:21,374
The Village Hidden in the Sound?
Did you go there?!

216
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:24,643
The compound was
already totally empty...

217
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:28,311
Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru
was there anymore.

218
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:33,020
You really gave that one
a lot of thought for a guy like you, huh...

219
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,019
I don't know where you heard that
about the Village Hidden in the Sound...

220
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:40,255
but if you're trying to fluster me
by talking rubbish like that,

221
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,596
it's not gonna happen.

222
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,996
Give up'cause you're going
to the next world.

223
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:52,309
Listen carefully. Don't you dare talk
that kind of trash again!

224
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:02,977
Naruto, this way.

225
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:04,884
<i>Iruka Sensei...</i>

226
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,860
Just try to catch me!

227
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,870
You jerk... don't even think
I'm gonna let you get away!

228
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,274
Now! Jump up, Naruto!

229
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,509
All right!!

230
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:35,481
Damn... this is!

231
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,281
Seal and Capture Perimeter!

232
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,418
The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!

233
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,966
Rasengan!

234
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,528
Naruto, that Jutsu is...

235
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:08,314
So that's the Fourth Hokage's
Jutsu... Rasengan...

236
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,855
Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?

237
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:17,261
Naruto, that was spectacular.
Good work!

238
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:18,754
Listen Sensei...

239
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,594
It looks like this guy didn't know
about the Village Hidden in the Sound.

240
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,767
So I was thinking that he's no longer...
with Orochimaru...

241
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,962
Don't talk trash...

242
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,697
Mizuki...

243
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,571
You gotta be kidding...

244
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,814
This is an extreme body that
I received from Lord Orochimaru...

245
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,077
I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound
and become even more...

246
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,116
Iruka Sensei What's this?!

247
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:44,917
It's just as I thought, after all.

248
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:46,883
Old Lady Tsunade...

249
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,449
Lady Tsunade.

250
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,062
His cells have started dying.

251
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:55,025
You jerk...
What have you done to me?!

252
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,167
It's not Naruto's fault.

253
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,736
It's caused from the substances
you took!

254
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:02,265
What? That's impossible!

255
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:04,641
You're getting a taste of
your own medicine.

256
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:08,169
That substance wasn't
fully developed yet.

257
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,477
The last casualty has been recovered.

258
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,688
It appears that Shizune was injured,
but there's no threat to her life.

259
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,116
I see. Thanks for your work.

260
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,723
That's a relief... Shizune is safe.

261
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,193
Orochimaru probably developed
that substance by chance

262
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,602
while he was trying to develop
a Forbidden Jutsu.

263
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:37,306
What is certain is that

264
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,400
that substance assimilates
the DNA of animals

265
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,172
and when it combines
with the human body

266
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,714
that serves to draw out its power
in an explosive manner.

267
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,314
But its effect is only short term.

268
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:52,482
And in exchange,
it puts a strain on the cells

269
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:55,287
that far exceeds the limits
of the human body.

270
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:58,525
It certainly isn't something
that's one could actually use.

271
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,964
But why did Mizuki?

272
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:05,231
I don't know the details

273
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,430
but it must be that Mizuki
and Orochimaru

274
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,905
had a point of contact in the past...

275
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,440
However...

276
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:13,134
That tie has already been severed.

277
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:18,179
Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru
just used him as a plaything.

278
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,677
Giving him an unusable drug...
he's probably laughing his butt off.

279
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:26,048
But Mizuki is one lucky guy...

280
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,053
An ordinary Shinobi would
have lost his life.

281
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:34,258
<i>Although he won't be able to live</i>
<i>his life as a Shinobi any more.</i>

282
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,035
Unfortunate, isn't it, Naruto?

283
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:41,468
I kind of had that feeling anyway...

284
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,707
I see.

285
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,273
But I won't give up!

286
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:48,540
I will continue to do my best to search
for clues to Sasuke's whereabouts.

287
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:52,681
Tsubaki...

288
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,652
Damn it, Iruka!

289
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,051
Don't talk!

290
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:01,553
Next time I'll take you and that
little squirt down without fail.

291
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,358
There's no way you
could do that.

292
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:06,795
While you were pursuing
your futile dream,

293
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,356
Naruto's been actively honing
his skills.

294
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,294
You can't possibly catch up
with him any longer.

295
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,365
Mizuki can never go back
to being a Shinobi again...

296
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:18,672
Tsubaki...

297
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:21,672
I'm thinking of starting over
again too...

298
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:26,881
But first I must atone for
all the trouble I caused the village...

299
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,878
What a beautiful sunset.

300
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:35,758
Let's return to the village.

301
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,692
Dried and Canned Goods

302
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,564
Fish Market

303
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,972
I won't...

304
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,598
ever give up either!

305
00:19:58,883 --> 00:19:59,941
I did it!

306
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,090
All right, since everybody
worked so hard today,

307
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,527
I'm going to do something special
and treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.

308
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:16,167
Yippee! You're a real man,
Iruka Sensei!

309
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:18,562
I want a block of barbecued pork!

310
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,933
I want large portions of
all three kinds of ramen noodles -

311
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,563
miso, soy sauce and butter!

312
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,465
Hey, Iruka, before you do that,

313
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,102
you and Naruto need to go
to Leaf Village Hospital.

314
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:29,906
Huh... I told you I'm okay.

315
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,243
Don't argue with me.

316
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,580
Lady Tsunade!

317
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,685
I cleared the first stage!

318
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:45,786
<i>She's just started her</i>
<i>ascetic training...</i>

319
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:49,965
<i>Could she be an exceptional talent</i>
<i>on par with Shizune... ?

320
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:54,100
Hey, Sakura...!

321
00:20:57,408 --> 00:21:00,036
<i>This time you saved me...</i>

322
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:07,347
<i>You've really become stronger,</i>
<i>haven't you, Naruto.</i>

323
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:32,292
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

324
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:35,765
<i>And you become speechless</i>

325
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:41,765
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

326
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,003
<i>So you don't answer</i>

327
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:50,706
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

328
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:55,583
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

329
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:58,088
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

330
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:07,292
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

331
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:16,900
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

332
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:26,077
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

333
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:37,890
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

334
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:52,036
I can't stand it any longer!

335
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:55,838
No matter how long I wait, there's no clue
about Sasuke's whereabouts!

336
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:59,949
And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps
telling me not to do a thing!

337
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:03,252
At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!

338
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:05,451
Isn't there anything?

339
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:09,255
Something, anything...
a clue to finding Sasuke!

340
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:15,289
