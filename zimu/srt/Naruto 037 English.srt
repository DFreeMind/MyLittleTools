If you do not possess the Sky,
it earns acquaintance and you be prepared.

17
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,420
If you do not possess the Earth,
you run for the fields and finds the force.

18
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,290
If you open the Sky and the Earth

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,310
 the dangerous way becomes sure.

20
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,550
With this principle you will become

21
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,530
 " " ()

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,920
Which thing means?

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
Sure one refers to the coils.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,110
Task that

25
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,300
 it wants to say to open them.

26
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,560
Well.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Then we open them.

28
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,310
But that cos' it is?

29
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,210
Hito Jin

30
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,910
E' the formula

31
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,570
 of the Kuchiyose not Jutsu!
* Technique of the evocation

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,860
Naruto! Sakura!

33
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,870
It throws them to you via!

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,430
But you

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
Hello.

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,660
How much time.

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,250
-  The SECOND OLD E' TEST! -
The alignment of the 9 esordienti.

38
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,260
What happens?

39
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,650
E' be hard

40
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,710
 true?

41
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,880
Iruka-Sensei, why six appeared

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,910
 with the Kuchiyose not Jutsu?

43
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,070
We chunin must receive the candidates

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,340
.... to the end of the second test

45
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,380
 and for case he is capitato to me
it makes you from messenger.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,180
Messenger?

47
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,940
uhm....

48
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,090
Just in time.

49
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,260
All and three

50
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,110
 you have exceeded the second test.

51
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,560
Congratulations!

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,470
It would appeal to to offer you to me of the ramen

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,700
 for this happening, but

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,270
Evviva!

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,900
Ehi Naruto!

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,700
It listens until the end

57
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,390
Ramen! Ramen! Dattebayo!

58
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,870
They are a large one!

59
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,600
They are the best one!

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,650
I want the ramen!

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,290
It has some of energies.

62
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,530
Hush!

63
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,970
Accidents

64
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,220
You do not succeed in rilassarti a moment.

65
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,570
Six not changed at all.

66
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,760
I have understood!

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,810
!?

68
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,670
If we had opened the coils during the test

69
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,090
 Iruka-sensei

70
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,890
 what you would have made?

71
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,410
Sasuke

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,220
 intelligent as usual.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,090
As you have intuito

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,070
 the rules of this examination

75
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,920
 they put to the test your abilities
to execute the missions honestly.

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
If during the examination

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,950
 you would have opened the coils

78
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,460
 smashing the rule

79
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,480
What would be happened?

80
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,630
Those candidates would be

81
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,140
 remained incoscenti until
to the end of the test.

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,260
These were the orders.

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,600
Fortune that you have not opened it.

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,220
Kabuto-saint

85
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,260
 thanks thousands.

86
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,170
For a hair!

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,330
Me excuses, sensei.

88
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,310
What means the written one on the wall?

89
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,660
It seems type a indovinello

90
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,440
 but we do not succeed to understand it.

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,370
Which devil you of frega?

92
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,750
A lot we are promoted!

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,860
Not

94
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,330
 my task is also
to explain of the meant one to you.

95
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,730
!?

96
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,050
Indeed?

97
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,460
Sure that is true!

98
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,740
You read here.

99
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,010
E' the maxim of the chunin

100
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,070
 written from Hokage-sama.

101
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,670
The maxim?

102
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,750
S !

103
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,540
The "sky" represents the mind of the man

104
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,760
 while the "earth" represents the body.

105
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,820
Without the "sky" the wisdom is not obtained.

106
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,130
Fundamental E'.

107
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,960
As an example:

108
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,540
If the point weak person of Naruto is the mind

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,820
 it will have to take of conscience
and to improve that aspect.

110
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,670
But

111
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,340
 that beautiful example!

112
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Also it is written

113
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,410
 that without the "earth" not
it runs for the fields.

114
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,530
If the point weak person of Sakura is the physical resistance

115
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,250
 then it will have to be trained with tenacity

116
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,120
 every day.

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,310
Having it is the "sky" that the "earth "

118
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,990
 whichever pericosa mission becomes just.

119
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,930
That is

120
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,380
 the missions will not be more a danger.

121
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,840
Then

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,500
 what is in place of the lacking word?

123
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,810
It represents the Chunin.

124
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,030
The word "man" who found itself

125
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,730
  within parchments.>.

126
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,880
This test verified

127
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,410
 necessary the basic abilities
in order to become a Chunin.

128
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,270
And you have exceeded it.

129
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,640
The chunin he is a squad leader

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,410
 and as such he must guide the square.

131
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,690
He possesses acquaintance, force and inner sagezza.

132
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,340
All this

133
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,210
 it is necessary in order to carry out the own tasks.

134
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,020
I would want that you faced

135
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,600
 the next obstacle

136
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,730
 holding to mind this instruction.

137
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,130
This is

138
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,680
 all the one which I had from dirvi.

139
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,840
Received!

140
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,770
But

141
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,300
 in the third and last test

142
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,140
 not exaggerated.

143
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,620
Especially you naruto

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,270
 six the one which more
Iruka-sensei

145
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,990
From when I have received the coprifronte of Konoha

146
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,410
 they are not more the dispettoso student of the academy!

147
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,180
Not there is reason of preoccuparsi.

148
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,720
Moreover this....

149
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,380
 it is the maturity symbol

150
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,300
 that you have given to me.

151
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,390
Perhaps always they are stirred violently

152
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,150
 but they are not more a child.

153
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Why

154
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,230
 now they are a ninja!

155
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,530
I have understood.

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,850
Scusami, Naruto.

157
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,890
I

158
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,080
 they are what it knows
better their force.

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,210
Inasmuch as riusciranno to us I would not want to be
I to assist them to the withdrawal.

160
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,990
If you hold us cos   a lot
to the square ve I leave it

161
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,820
 but you are sure of wanting to you
to assume an ungrateful task cos  ?

162
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,290
Ringrazio to you.

163
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,210
But it remembers to you

164
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,160
 that they are of the group of Kakashi.

165
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,600
I waited for me great things

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,420
 from genin from he candidates.

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,200
Stanne outside!

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,580
They are not more your students.

169
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,750
Bens 

170
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,060
 my subordinates.

171
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,010
What he knows better their force

172
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,330
 Kakashi-saint

173
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,790
 six sure you.

174
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,620
He still burns the Juin Jutsu?
(Cursed Brand)

175
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,250
I can make something?

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,110
Not.

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,350
Thanks but hour go very better.

178
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,790
To propostito, Orochimaru is one of the three

179
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,540
 leggendari ninja of Konoha, just?

180
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,610
E' a ninja traitor of class ' present S' in the BingoBook
and neanche the Ambu could face it.
(BingoBook: Black List)

181
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,200
Also I have felt to say that it was dead.

182
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,280
Why

183
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,670
 it is intentional to return to the village?

184
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,400
It was from that I tried a type like he.

185
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,830
That boy will make road with
the blood of the Uchiha clan.

186
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,430
Probably

187
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,610
For Sasuke I imagine.

188
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,030

202
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,780
I had announced that I would have halved the number

203
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,540
 in truth I expected only a pair of squares.

204
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,110

205
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,270

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,910
But finch there is my group

214
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,210
 they will not be able to continue.

215
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,580
Inasmuch as in the next test

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,090
 they count only the abilities characterizes them.

217
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,190
The giovinezza e' po' sweet and a po' bitter

That one is the eternal one avails again of Gai-Sensei.

224
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,510
From the aesthetic point of view

225
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,120
 Gai-sensei remains defeated.

226
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,090
Between all the masters

227
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,110
 Gai-sensei remains the best one!

237
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,610
 struck, Gai-sensei.

238
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,720
All the more remarkable elements are remained.

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,650
Uchiha Sasuke-kun.

240
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,270
You  I will make  to pay for
my arm

241
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,450
 Uchiha Sasuke

242
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,050
You can bet to us.

243
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,120

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,760
 she begins them are remained.

245
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,250
As I thought does not have not even a scratch.

246
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,760
Gaara.

247
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,760
Akamaru is behaved in strange way.

248
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,450
The three of the sand

249
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,800
And cos   six passed also you,
Naruto-kun.

250
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,630

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,850

There is also the old Hokage, Iruka-sensei
and also the sopracciglione!

255
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,150
it seems that there are

256
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,690
 large pieces of Konoha.

257
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,070
I have an ugly prefeeling.

258
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,540

259
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,600

Here why they insisted to candidarli.

261
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720

262
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,150
 Hokage-sama will illustrate to you

263
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,270

Therefore you open the orecchie well.

265
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,460
I pray.

266
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,170
Hokage-sama.

267
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,680
S .

268
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,380
The Third Test is in order to begin.

269
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,280
But before the explanation

270
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,990
 I want to clear one what

271
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,290
 R-with regard to the true scope of this examination.

272
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,330
The true scope?

273
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:41,690
Sapete why the examination is carried out
with to the countries it allies to you?

274
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,390
For rinsaldare the friendship and in order to raise

275
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,080
 the general level of the ninja.

276
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,060
Why this examination

277
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,090
 in practical

278
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,680
In practical

279
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,210
E' the simulation of war between countries allies to you.

280
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,980
What means?

281
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,830
If we return behind in the history

282
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,680
 the countries ally to you that you know hour

283
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,050
 adjacent countries were alone
in continuous war for the power.

284
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,360
In order to avoid to waste the forces
and to destroy an other

285
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,260
 it came established a battle place

286
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,130
 that it gave origin

287
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,100
 to this examination of selection of the Chunin!

288
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,380
But like?

289
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,700
We do not participate in order to become chunin?

290
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,020
Sure.

291
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,590
This examination serves in order to select the ninja
in a position to becoming Chunin.

292
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,650
But it is also true that the ninja

293
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,380
 that they carry on the shoulders

294
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,700
 the dignity of the country

295
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,290
 they must fight to cost
of the own life.

296
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,920
The dignity of the country?

297
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,510
And above all the Daimyo and the ninja
commanders of every country

298
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:20,020
 they will assist to your combat.

299
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,830
When he comes cleared the difference of being able

300
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,830
 between several the countries

301
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,050
 the strong countries obtain

302
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,470
 numerous demands for job

303
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,930
 and to the contrary the countries weak people

304
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,550
 they suffer from one lessening of the demands.

305
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,650
To that point the adjacent countries

306
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,580
 with the stronger countries they are felt threatens to you
why they comprise the development of the power
military of the other states....

307
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,360
 in degree therefore to exercise
political pressures on they.

308
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,680
And then!

309
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,400
Why there is need to fight
to cost of living?

310
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,160
The power of a country

311
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,220
 it is the power of its village.

312
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,710
The power of a village

313
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,110
 it is the power of the ninja that they dwell to you.

314
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,320
This examination

315
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,260
 servants in order to demonstrate the force of every country.

316
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,650
Only if....

317
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,360
 she fights herself to cost
of the life the examination has sense.

318
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,280
Also your predecessori have
fought in this examination

319
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
 for the same reason.

320
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,230
But then why it is spoken

321
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,280
 a lot of friendship between the countries?

322
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,340
For this to the beginning I have said to you

323
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,950
 not to misinterpret of the true one meant.

324
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,220
In the world of the ninja for friendship one agrees

325
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,980
 to improve itself to vicissitude fighting to risk

326
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,190
 of the own life.

327
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,770
This will be a mortal crash them that you will face
in name of your dreams and the honor of the village.

328
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,890
Beautiful speech.

It would appeal to to me to illustrate to you in the detail

333
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,840

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,270
