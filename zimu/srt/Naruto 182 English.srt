1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:03,792
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,627
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:12,729
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:29,188
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:37,322
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:57,041
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:02,487
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:07,891
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,055
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:19,869
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:49,599
<i>Reunion. The Remaining Time</i>

16
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,586
<i>What's going to happen?!</i>

17
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,842
What's the deal?!

18
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,409
Sumaru's mom is being
pressed back!

19
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,113
My star training is
done my own way.

20
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:42,815
It shouldn't be a match

21
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,950
for one who has completed
proper star training like you.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,419
But what's with that sorry state?

23
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:53,931
I can't feel even a smidgeon
of the power from before.

24
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:59,036
Sure enough, you've also got
side effects from the star training...

25
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,474
Even if this life should end...

26
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,609
I'll never forgive you!

27
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:18,720
Lord Akahoshi!

28
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,121
What?

29
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:40,840
You be a good boy!

30
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,746
It's a simple mission.

31
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,248
We'll be able to come back home
right away.

32
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,016
Right! Have a safe journey.

33
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:52,590
Mother!

34
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,625
Mother!

35
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,892
Mother!

36
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:05,095
Sumaru...!

37
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,671
Mother!

38
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,037
Sumaru!

39
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,154
Oh, no!

40
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,262
Lord Akahoshi.
Why would you do such a thing?

41
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,838
Is it true then...?

42
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,645
Give it back...

43
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,190
Hold it!

44
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:09,832
Farewell.

45
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,367
Wh What?

46
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:18,236
Then it was Lord Akahoshi

47
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:21,109
who knocked everyone out
and took Sumaru away?

48
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:23,507
A sensei who does something
like that

49
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,177
to students who believe in him
is unforgivable!

50
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,716
Why in the world...?
Why would you do such a thing?

51
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,613
It's all for the sake of the village...

52
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:33,383
It's for the sake of taking back
the star she stole!

53
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:34,715
Even if that were the case,

54
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:37,285
that doesn't make for a reason
to cause Sumaru pain!

55
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:41,030
That person is Sumaru's mom!

56
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,164
M My... mother...

57
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,495
Exactly!

58
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,773
However, even if she is your mother,
she's now your enemy!

59
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,174
The person before you is
the woman who stole the star

60
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:58,149
and attempted to bring about
the doom to our village!

61
00:05:58,518 --> 00:05:59,815
That's wrong!

62
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,454
Sumaru's mom just hid the star

63
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:05,548
in order to save everyone from
the pain of the training!

64
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:08,656
Foolishness! Being able to die
for the sake of the village

65
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,252
is a Shinobi's long cherished dream!

66
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,892
Isn't that right, Sumaru?!

67
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:15,497
You're going to become the Hoshikage
and put to shame

68
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,763
the Five Great Hidden Villages
that treated us with contempt, right?

69
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:22,530
Yes... I want to become the Hoshikage
and put them to shame...

70
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,312
Show your foolish mother
your determination!

71
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:31,377
Yes... I can die if it's for
the sake of the village.

72
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,381
Sumaru!

73
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,510
Don't do anything stupid, Sumaru!

74
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,956
<i>His Chakra is in synch with Akahoshi's.</i>

75
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:41,124
Sumaru is being controlled!

76
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,186
What?!

77
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:49,434
Exactly... I have Sumaru's life
in the palm of my hand.

78
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,197
Lady Natsuhi.

79
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,703
I shall give you the ultimate choice!

80
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,908
Will you take the star?

81
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:59,809
Or... your son's life?

82
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,704
Wait!

83
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:07,945
What's the matter, Lady Natsuhi?

84
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,878
Have you realized
your own foolishness?

85
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:15,820
Lady...

86
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:18,256
You win, Akahoshi.

87
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,668
Sumaru!

88
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,212
You did it!

89
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:15,783
Excellent. How did you get it?

90
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:20,755
Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned it
with good grace.

91
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:23,884
Lady!

92
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,202
That's dirty!

93
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,772
Sumaru!

94
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,879
Sumaru...

95
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,818
Is that person... really...?

96
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:57,820
What're you doing?!

97
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:00,295
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

98
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,566
- You...! I won't forgive you!
- You...! I won't forgive you!

99
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:10,509
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
I'm your employer.

100
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,408
- That doesn't make any difference!
- That doesn't make any difference!

101
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:14,705
Wait, Naruto!

102
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,110
Neji!

103
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,718
Why, Neji? I can't stand this either.

104
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:23,581
No! From here on is an issue
for the Hidden Star.

105
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,150
It's none of our concern!

106
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,595
That being said, are we just going
to leave them be?

107
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,055
Anything further would be beyond
the scope of the mission...

108
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:38,160
The Leaf must not betray the client
of the accepted mission, right?

109
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,100
Damn it!

110
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:52,416
Oh well.

111
00:09:56,455 --> 00:10:00,255
The star has returned.
I'll overlook everyone's actions today.

112
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,620
Those who wish to continue to live
for the sake of the village, come with me...

113
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:08,325
B-But... Sumaru is...

114
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,734
Forsake the son of the traitor.

115
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,135
Pull out!

116
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:16,202
Yes, my lord!

117
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:33,148
I'm sorry. I must not leave
Sumaru behind.

118
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,621
Rogue Ninja!

119
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,094
Hokuto! You'll regret this!

120
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,422
Well, do as you like!

121
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,267
That jerk...!

122
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:28,914
Hey, look...!

123
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,974
It's called Natsuboshi.

124
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,585
It's the other name for
the planet Mars, right?

125
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,952
It seems it's the same name
as Sumaru's mom...

126
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:42,152
Sumaru thinks that star
is protecting him.

127
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,928
I bet Lady Natsuhi was also
looking at that star.

128
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,527
I'm moved.

129
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,069
The hearts of parent and child
are connected!

130
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,098
Yeah...

131
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,169
How're the two doing?

132
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,111
They're resting comfortably now...

133
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:05,139
But Akahoshi attack
the mother took

134
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:09,711
when her body was weakened
from the effects of the star is a fatal one.

135
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,353
Her Chakra Network is in shreds
and it will mean certain death

136
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,723
if she uses that Jutsu
even one more time...

137
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:19,822
Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could...

138
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,723
Who knows...?

139
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:27,831
Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk
is unforgivable!

140
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,196
I'll kick his butt!

141
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,373
Naruto! You still don't get it?

142
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:37,004
But he's a huge scoundrel.

143
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:38,340
That's right!

144
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,187
The Leaf would lose credibility

145
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,846
if we do something like betraying a client.

146
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,224
But we can't leave things be, right?

147
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,193
Well, I also understand what
Neji's saying.

148
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,128
We must ask the Lady Hokage
for instructions.

149
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:53,764
That's right.

150
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,064
Anyway, let's take those two to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

151
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:01,063
Yeah... The Hidden Star matter
will come after that.

152
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,887
Sumaru.

153
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,850
Mother!

154
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,583
Mother.

155
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,286
You're probably angry,
aren't you, Sumaru...?

156
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,190
Of course, you would resent me...
who abandoned the village

157
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,127
and went so far as to entrust you
to someone else.

158
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:00,691
How often I attempted to take you
with me...

159
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,395
But I kept telling myself that

160
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,430
I couldn't make you happy since
I had become a Rogue Ninja...

161
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,705
with this body that could
give out at any time

162
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:15,872
due to the star training.

163
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:22,676
Stay away!

164
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,555
I often had the same dream.

165
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:33,797
A dream where I chase
after you two, crying.

166
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,179
Sumaru.

167
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,609
Mother!

168
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,246
I kept telling myself

169
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,383
that my mother was not
a cold hearted person

170
00:14:58,457 --> 00:14:59,685
who would leave me behind...

171
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,484
You had died.

172
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:05,029
Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.

173
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,499
He said you had been killed by
a Ninja from some other land,

174
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,831
died and turned into a star...

175
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,670
He said you had turned
into the Natsuhiboshi...!

176
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:51,573
Sumaru...

177
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:55,845
Mother!

178
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,376
Even so...

179
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,218
Even so... I wanted you to
take me with you.

180
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:08,825
Sumaru...

181
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,624
I was Ionesome... Mother...

182
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:33,942
<i>Natsuboshi, why are you so red?</i>

183
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:39,518
<i>Because I had a sad dream last night</i>

184
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,597
<i>My eyes are red, from the tears I shed</i>

185
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:51,536
<i>Swollen as I cried...</i>

186
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:09,110
<i>Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?</i>

187
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:14,492
<i>I'm searching for a child</i>
<i>who has gone afar</i>

188
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:20,697
<i>He can't be found. Though I search all day</i>

189
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:26,671
<i>My sad dreams come once more</i>

190
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,566
Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!

191
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,631
Where's the lady? Your mom.

192
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,072
Hey, where'd she go?

193
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:05,272
What?!

194
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:07,774
This is bad...

195
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:10,447
Mother!

196
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,827
Even if it costs my life,
I can't let that star be...

197
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:35,099
There mustn't be any more
sad mothers and children!

198
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,042
<i>Can't let it happen.</i>
<i>If she gets reckless...</i>

199
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:44,139
<i>and ends up using that Jutsu again...</i>

200
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:58,156
<i>It became the village's power</i>
<i>and protected the village.</i>

201
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,357
<i>I didn't want to have to destroy it...</i>

202
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:13,333
But star, you have caused
pain and suffering

203
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:14,777
to one too many of the children...

204
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,711
Forgive me...

205
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,156
Akahoshi...

206
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,558
Ninja Art: Kujaku

207
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,060
Beast!

208
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,952
Sumaru...

209
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:11,461
So your strength has given out?
How tragic.

210
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:16,639
Mother...

211
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,910
Hey, what's the matter?

212
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,009
It couldn't be! Lady Natsuhi is...

213
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:33,282
<i>Mother died!</i>

214
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,962
As of this moment,

215
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,693
I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name
of Fourth Hoshikage!

216
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,966
I shall announce the first mission
as Hoshikage.

217
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,798
The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,

218
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:52,433
and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi
are enemies who demean us!

219
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:56,509
If you find them attempting
to enter the village,

220
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,206
bring them down immediately!

221
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,639
Yes, my lord!

222
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,025
I will...

223
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,718
I will get the one who killed
my mother!

224
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:12,893
Sumaru!

225
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:30,280
<i>Yesterday's Call Sign,</i>
<i>was all from my cell phone.</i>

226
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:36,952
<i>In a strange park,</i>
<i>I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.</i>

227
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,560
<i>Yellow Moon.</i>

228
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:59,440
<i>Even now, counting to three,</i>
<i>I open my eyes</i>

229
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:04,539
<i>Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.</i>

230
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:11,521
<i>Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,</i>
<i>as we face one another's back</i>

231
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,428
<i>Look at my eyes, when can we meet?</i>

232
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:25,198
<i>EveryDay EveryNight</i>
<i>With every word I can think of</i>

233
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:31,971
<i>Right away, my messy feelings as is,</i>

234
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:38,648
<i>A magical chord change, in a restless city</i>

235
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:45,682
<i>A daily JAZZ Guitar played</i>
<i>in a soft minor key</i>

236
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,192
Damn that Akahoshi jerk!
I can't forgive him anymore.

237
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:55,798
He's diabolical.

238
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:56,925
Hey, you two!

239
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,867
I'll pound him with a good one.

240
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,905
Forget it. Don't stick your nose
into their internal affairs.

241
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:03,497
Then, I'll beat him into shape
with my Lotus.

242
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,202
That'd be the same as Naruto.

243
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:06,574
Then what're you saying we do?

244
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,613
Anyway, I'm going, so.

245
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,339
I'll go with you.

246
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,781
No. Do you guys want to start
a war with the Hidden Star?

247
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,809
Next time: "The Star's Radiance"
