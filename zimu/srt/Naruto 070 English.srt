2
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,397
Release the Genjutsu and wake Naruto and Shikamaru up.

3
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:36,529
It's the first mission after a long time.

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,034
A mission?

5
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,073
Take it with care.

6
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,033
It's another A-rank mission like the Wave country mission.

7
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:52,467
Ouch!

8
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,269
You also were able to do counter-Genjutsu!
Why were you pretending to be sleeping!?

9
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:05,187
Go after Sasuke and join him to stop him...
and until further orders, stay at a safe place.

10
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,794
What happened to Sasuke?

11
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,892
I'll explain as we go.

12
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:11,612
We're leaving!

13
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:41,805
I see. That's what was going on. Sasuke rushed in.

14
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:47,172
Why was I selected for this? This is way too much trouble!

15
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:51,900
You have no choice! It was Kakashi-sensei's order!

16
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:56,956
This way.

17
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,582
How soon can we reach him?

18
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:05,681
I don't know. He's moving at very high speed also.

19
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:07,432
Shit!

20
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,165
Damn it!

21
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:16,670
No. 1 guy to run away Troublesome, but I have to do it!!

22
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:42,140
Hey you guys. Pick up the pace more.

23
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:43,810
What's up?

24
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,679
You found Sasuke?

25
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,623
No. Two small units, eight people are coming from behind.

26
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:54,256
No, wait... one more person. Nine are chasing us.

27
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:59,279
No way! Already? This isn't funny.

28
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,567
It seems that they haven't figured
exactly where we are, but...

29
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:29,380
we've got no choice but give them the slip.

30
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,846
Hey! What're you going to do by stopping?!

31
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,314
Shut up and follow me!

32
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:53,931
Backup by using your own footprints. This will make
it look like the footsteps all of the sudden disappear.

33
00:04:57,273 --> 00:05:02,862
But even if we do this, they'll figure it out eventually.

34
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:06,951
It will earn us some time at least. That's enough.

35
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:12,839
It looks like the impatientness has risen within
the chasers. It will cloud their sight for chasing,

36
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:16,425
and if they lose signs of us, then that will be good for us.

37
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,510
Hurry Up!

38
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,575
We don't have time.

39
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,791
I know that!

40
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:56,243
This is not good. They're shortening the distance
between us, even though they're cautious about an ambush.

41
00:05:56,244 --> 00:06:03,162
Shit. I'd bet all of them are Chunin or above
level. If they catch us, we'll be annihilated.

42
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,028
Annihilated!

43
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,683
Then... then should we ambush them?

44
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,282
Ambush? That's a good idea.

45
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:21,539
It's true that we're at an advantage to ambush. Even since
the enemy has double the number, if we catch them off guard...

46
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:27,516
It still won't work. They're subordinates
of Orochimaru, who once was a Konoha shinobi.

47
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:31,186
In the worse case, there may also be Jounin's with them.

48
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:35,896
I thought we could do it, but I guess not.

49
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:42,097
Hold on a sec. Why? The enemy's level isn't
that much of the factor for an ambush, is it?

50
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,102
Hey, what're you saying?

51
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:47,281
You guys don't understand it at all.

52
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:55,883
Listen. It's true that an ambush is a very advantageous
basic tactic, but there're two neccessary conditions.

53
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,044
What are those neccessary conditions?

54
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:05,342
One... move without making any sounds,
and find the pursuers before being found.

55
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:15,973
Two... Get in the position, and conceal yourself quickly, where
 you can catch the chaser off guard and give the sure damage.

56
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,148
Only when those two conditions are
met, the ambush becomes effective.

57
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:29,786
Meeting the first condition won't be that hard
since we have the Nin-Ken's (Ninja dog) nose.

58
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:33,824
And the second condition... it seems
that we have the advantage with the

59
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:37,661
knowledge of the geography of this
village because this is our village. BUT

60
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:44,227
Orochimaru has been here before. This won't
work against the subordinates of Orochimaru.

61
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,218
So, what do you mean?

62
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:54,392
I'm sure that the chasers were taught about the geography of
this village, and should've had mock trainings for this battle.

63
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:59,800
Also, I'd bet they're all the Ninjas with chasing skills.

64
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,507
I see... They know our hands.

65
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:09,439
Well, even then, an ambush is still effective.
But there's too many unknown factors.

66
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:16,781
Our enemies are special units that are formed
for this operation. But what we have is...

67
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:17,952
An idiot, ...

68
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,631
A Kunoich (female ninja) without any notable skills, ...

69
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,114
one dog, ...

70
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,933
and me, who is number one in evasive attitude.

71
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,675
Stragegy is to analyze the situation
throughly and to come up with the best plan.

72
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:38,581
So, there's only one thing we can do in this situation.

73
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,338
One thing?

74
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,801
A feint operation pretenting to be an ambush.

75
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:49,128
One will stay behind and make it
look like an ambush to delay them.

76
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,879
In other words, a decoy.

77
00:08:55,448 --> 00:09:01,036
That's right.  If one of us can delay them, they
won't be able to find the other three any more.

78
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:06,559
Well, we can give chasers the slip, but
the one who is the decoy will probably...

79
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:11,333
die.

80
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,933
So, who'll do it?

81
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:56,996
The dog is needed to chase Sasuke. That means...

82
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,485
I understood. I...

83
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,069
I guess it'll be me.

84
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,528
Why you?

85
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,929
It's better than being annihilated.

86
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:22,389
Also, you need one who can be a good
decoy and also has possibility to survive.

87
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,921
It's only me in us.

88
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:39,772
Kagemane-no-jutsu is originally for detaining.
Well, I'll catch up with you later, so go already.

89
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,498
I'll leave it to you, Shikamaru.

90
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:08,963
Is Shikamaru a person as dependable as this?

91
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:16,697
Be careful, Shikamaru.

92
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:47,662
No matter how hard you try to erase your signs...

93
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,620
it's still fully exposed.

94
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,269
Hey, the enemies are getting closer.

95
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:00,618
What?

96
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,887
Is that guy actually delaying them?

97
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:08,564
and me, who is number one in evasive attitude.

98
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:10,993
Maybe Shikamaru...

99
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:14,118
Don't worry about Shikamaru.

100
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,735
Did he possibly run away?

101
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,687
I said it's ok.

102
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,657
What?

103
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:26,165
He's got a bad mouth and is always lazy,
but he isn't the type who'd betray us.

104
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:36,399
He rarely say he'll do something voluntarily, but
he'll do it if he says he will. That's for sure.

105
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,898
I want to believe. I want to believe, but...

106
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,550
We'll increase the speed...

107
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:54,117
I somehow managed to run away.

108
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:05,131
The distance between footsteps is irregular.
Their anxiety must be making them tired.

109
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:23,342
Sorry. I thought I was always ready to run away, but...

110
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,975
I guess my character changed a bit this time.

111
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:34,638
It's true that I'm tired, but those footsteps are different.

112
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:39,946
By the way, this is the real body of those dog footsteps.

113
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:56,104
Man, it's just a little kid.
We all got caught by this kid...

114
00:13:56,444 --> 00:14:00,250
So this is the Kageshibari-no-jutsu
of Konoha that I heard of?

115
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:04,191
That's the old way of calling this.

116
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:10,740
Time's have changed. This is
called Kagemane these day, old men.

117
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:17,986
As I thought... that match wasn't good.

118
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:31,365
I used too much chakra. I won't
be able to hold this so long...

119
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,479
One.

120
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:36,744
Two.

121
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,438
Three, Four.

122
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,814
Five, Six, Seven.

123
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,336
Eight... Eight people.

124
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:50,782
Eight people... wait... no, one
more. Nine people are chasing us.

125
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:56,523
As I thought, the nineth one's role
is to protect them from an ambush.

126
00:14:56,524 --> 00:15:02,268
Moving behind keeping a certain
distance, to respond to enemy's attack.

127
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:15,638
Well, now it'll be found out where
the last one is hiding by this...

128
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:32,439
So... over there.

129
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:42,831
Shit. My shadow won't reach. I don't have
any more stamina to allocate to chakra.

130
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,336
It's useless. We know your technique.

131
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,916
Is this it?

132
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:59,492
I see that's your limit now. This so-called
Kagemane will be released soon. Be prepared!

133
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:20,599
I was going to be a decent ninja, earn a decent salary,
marry a decent women who is neither beautiful nor ugly,

134
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:26,551
and have two decent children. The first
one would be a girl and the next be a boy.

135
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:32,362
After the daughter got married and the
son becomes independent, I would retire...

136
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:38,256
as a Ninja and spend all day playing
Shogi and Go, and enjoy the retired life.

137
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:45,095
And finally die before the wife, due
to old age. That's the life I wanted.

138
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,413
I did extraordinary thing, outside of
my style. I wanted to stay ordinary.

139
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,904
I sure did a troublesome thing.

140
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:01,168
The chasers' movement has stopped.

141
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:05,113
Alright! The decoy was successful!

142
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,015
Shikamaru did it.

143
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,248
I'm sorry for doubting you even a little.

144
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:17,092
Good... Wait for me, Sasuke.

145
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:24,222
Shikamaru... Be sure to survive
and come and catch up with us!

146
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:31,297
As you said, it seems this is my limit.

147
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:43,499
Hey, come out now.

148
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:51,350
and cut this guy's head off on the way down.

149
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,169
I finally caught up with you.

150
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,763
Asuma... why?

151
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,421
You did good, Shikamaru.

152
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:18,107
It wasn't my character after all.

153
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,751
You retire here for now.

154
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:29,336
Hurry up!

155
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,065
What a persistent guy.

156
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:44,587
The number of chasers has increased... two, no three people.

157
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,169
Kankuro, we're increasing the pace.

158
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:48,987
Right!

159
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,527
I won't let you run away!

160
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,984
Don't do a rash thing, Sasuke.

161
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,240
Shall we get started now?

162
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:50,441
What on the earth is going on anyway?

163
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:53,112
Why is Hokage fighting against Orochimaru?

164
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,530
Why is Sasuke chasing the black-eye dude?

165
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:58,994
I was told to stop Sasuke... I have no idea what's going on!

166
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:01,950
Anyway's, I have no choice but to just chase him.

167
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:04,368
