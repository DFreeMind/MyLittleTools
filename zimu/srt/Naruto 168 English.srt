1
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:21,905
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,714
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:29,346
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,947
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:36,553
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:46,470
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:55,841
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:06,623
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:16,100
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:21,230
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,295
It's been a while since
I've eaten Ichiraku ramen!

12
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,892
Lately I've been away
from home on missions.

13
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:53,064
The bowl of ramen after
a mission...

14
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:57,235
it spreads to every muscle of the body
and becomes energy for tomorrow.

15
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,140
If you eat ramen
it drives fatigue away.

16
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:01,479
Ramen!

17
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,176
Ramen!

18
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,045
Ramen!

19
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:07,946
Ramen!

20
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,257
Temporarily closed...?

21
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,392
No, it can't be...

22
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:26,029
I endured all the tough missions,
looking forward to Ichiraku ramen...

23
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,402
I can smell ramen!

24
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:29,031
What?

25
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:33,541
You're right!

26
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:37,940
Without a doubt...
Ramen is being made in there!

27
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:40,642
Ramen!

28
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:45,984
<i>Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up!</i>
<i>Burn Copper Pot Burn!</i>

29
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:53,259
This smell...

30
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,926
It's the smell of a soup

31
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,435
that's never been on
the Ichiraku menu before.

32
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,004
Then... It's temporarily closed
to develop a new menu?

33
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:05,941
Who's there?!

34
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:14,885
A large helping of miso char siu ramen!
With an egg please.

35
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:20,490
I see...

36
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,957
You were looking forward to
my ramen that much.

37
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,926
Sorry about that.

38
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,761
It's okay to develop a new menu,

39
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,234
but I wish you'd do it
after the shop is closed.

40
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,472
Since you came all this way.
Give this a taste.

41
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:41,513
Could this be...

42
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:43,572
Ichiraku's new menu?!

43
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,016
Let's eat!

44
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,382
Wait a minute!

45
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,749
There are rules when you're eating
a new ramen for the first time...

46
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:51,881
Rule # 1!

47
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,619
Before you do anything,

48
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,354
you must first have
a sip to taste the soup.

49
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,863
- Delicious!
- Delicious!

50
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,531
Next, you have to coat the noodles
in soup and eat.

51
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:11,343
Huh? It seems like something
is missing...

52
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:12,770
Let's get to the point.

53
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,746
The noodles are outdone
by the soup!

54
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,244
This well seasoned, rich soup
greatly surpasses

55
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,777
any of Ichiraku's previous soups!

56
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,852
But! The noodles are
the same as always!

57
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,459
The balance is very bad.

58
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,825
I cannot give it a passing score!

59
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,431
That's what I thought...

60
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:37,298
Oh... Don't get so depressed...

61
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:40,670
Ayame, water! Water please!

62
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,671
Huh? Where's Ayame?

63
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,300
With ramen like this...

64
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:50,276
I'll never be able to get Ayame
back from the Ryonin.

65
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:54,511
Teuchi!

66
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,393
He's just overtired.

67
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:05,125
I had him drink an energy drink,
so after a little rest he'll recover.

68
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:09,058
But... I think he should take a break
from the shop for a while.

69
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,871
He's been using his arms
too much...

70
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:16,032
Look how swollen this is.

71
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,910
Come to think of it,
before he fell,

72
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,139
he said something about Ryonin
or whatever

73
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:24,012
did something to Ayame, I think...

74
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,012
Ayame is his daughter, right?

75
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:28,585
What's Ryonin?

76
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,280
I don't know...

77
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:34,053
Ryonin...
He's referring to the Ninja Chef.

78
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,822
Ninja Chef?

79
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,425
Do you know about them, Choji?

80
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,956
I've heard rumors about them...

81
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,574
One of the problems Shinobi's confront
on missions is the problem of meals!

82
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,270
Normally Food Pills were brought
with them,

83
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:54,074
but the main role of those
are to supply nutrients.

84
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,273
They have no taste.

85
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:58,849
If they could eat delicious food
while on missions,

86
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,081
would the success rate
of missions rise?

87
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,013
Based on that theory,
was born...

88
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,918
The Ninja Chef... Ryonin!

89
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:17,296
But what those Ninja Chef
have to do with Ayame?

90
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,560
They snatched her away...

91
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:21,237
What?!

92
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,332
What are you talking about?!

93
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:24,968
Give us the details!

94
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,936
It was two weeks ago...

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,251
Ichiraku Ramen

96
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:36,816
Welcome!

97
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:38,487
The large serving,
here's your order!

98
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:45,229
A good job as always, Teuchi!

99
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,633
Hakkaku!

100
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,031
His name is Hakkaku,

101
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:53,265
long ago we trained at
the same ramen shop...

102
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:57,439
He told me he is a Ninja Chef,
a Ryonin, these days.

103
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,406
Actually... I have a favor to ask you.

104
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,108
What is it? If it's something I can do,
I'll cooperate.

105
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,846
The phantom recipe that
I heard you developed...

106
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:10,979
Please turn it over to me!

107
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:15,223
Ph Phantom recipe?
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,894
To a chef, a recipe is
more precious than life!

109
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,230
I understand why
you want to hide it!

110
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,369
But... please! Give it to me!

111
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,731
I really had no clue.

112
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:32,002
But Hakkaku didn't believe me...

113
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,738
Ayame. Let's get to work
opening the shop...

114
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:40,049
What the... What's this tray?

115
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,752
Ayame!

116
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,256
<i>I have your daughter.</i>

117
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:50,625
<i>If you want her back,</i>
<i>hand over the "phantom recipe!"</i>

118
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,430
Damn that Hakkaku!

119
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,470
Why didn't you contact
the Hokage right away!

120
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,072
The Hokage could...

121
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,905
If I did that, I don't know what
would happen to Ayame.

122
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:07,940
And he also wrote this
in the letter...

123
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,947
That if I can serve them
something impressive,

124
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:15,545
he'll give up on the phantom recipe
and return my daughter safe.

125
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,514
But, you've got a way to win?

126
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,751
I don't know.

127
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,484
But a chef's challenged me
to a cooking match.

128
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,292
I have no choice but to do it.

129
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:29,459
So that's why you're developing
new ramen.

130
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,732
I was able to make the soup
exactly how I wanted to.

131
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:38,175
But... I just can't get the firm noodles
that go with the soup...

132
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:42,205
I can't get Ayame back like this!

133
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:46,945
The cooking match is tomorrow...
What am I going to do?

134
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,552
I can't imagine an Ichiraku
without Ayame.

135
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:03,097
Okay! Teuchi! We'll help you.

136
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,999
We'll make the best ramen...

137
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,272
And get Ayame back...

138
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,666
From the Ryonin!

139
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,711
You guys...

140
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,677
I'll teach you the basics
of making noodles.

141
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,416
Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.

142
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,548
If there are discrepancies,

143
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,355
there will be variations in
the taste of the noodles.

144
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,059
Next... Knead it.

145
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,992
If you don't put this properly
the noodles won't be firm.

146
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,196
Are you okay?

147
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:38,030
It's nothing. Don't worry about me.

148
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,101
And... stretch the noodles!

149
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:50,338
It's important for them to be
of a uniform thickness!

150
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,509
So there will be no differences
after boiling...

151
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:58,055
Try it.

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,351
<i>It's easy to say it...</i>

153
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:06,364
<i>but to actually make the noodles</i>
<i>is not so easy.</i>

154
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,497
<i>It takes five years to become</i>
<i>an accomplished chef in his own right.</i>

155
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,505
<i>To do it by the match tomorrow</i>
<i>is completely...</i>

156
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,297
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>

157
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,605
<i>I'll have to give up this decrepit body</i>
<i>of mine to them.</i>

158
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,877
Teuchi...

159
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:25,280
You're not thinking about
when you lose, are you?

160
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:27,316
Th That's...

161
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,015
Because if we are doing this,

162
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,182
we're doing it with the intention
of winning, believe it!

163
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:36,356
I absolutely don't forgive people
who hold a girl captive!

164
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,491
Cooking comes from the heart.

165
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:41,496
Technique and experience
aren't everything!

166
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:43,997
No problem...

167
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,366
We'll show them the real strength
of the Shinobi of Leaf Village!

168
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,716
Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!

169
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,320
The phantom recipe?

170
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,217
You can't tell by looking at me?

171
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,892
I see. How foolish...

172
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,594
Let me tell you,

173
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,828
ramen like the stuff I ate at
your shop the other day can't win.

174
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,528
Is Ayame okay?

175
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,401
Father!

176
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,170
Ayame!

177
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,735
The emotional reunion comes
after the match.

178
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,404
I have a favor to ask.
Let me have some helpers.

179
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:34,148
I don't think those kids are up
to the task, but...

180
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,145
Well... That's okay.

181
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,747
Well, let's start the cooking match!

182
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,733
Let's see if you can satisfy
all of us Ninja Chef!

183
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,763
There are so many of them...

184
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,168
We don't have time to stand around...
Let's begin!

185
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,899
The preparation for the soup
is done!

186
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,669
I'll prepare the ingredients
for the rest!

187
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,302
I'm leaving the noodles to you!

188
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,378
- Okay!
- Okay!

189
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:07,652
Listen. Our noodles determine
whether Ayame will return or not!

190
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,645
We cannot fail!

191
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,353
<i>Seems like he's done a good job</i>
<i>with the soup...</i>

192
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,893
<i>The delicious aroma is</i>
<i>wafting over here.</i>

193
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,019
<i>Indeed, it's whetting my appetite.</i>

194
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,755
The noodles are the problem!

195
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,935
<i>Can those kids really make noodles that</i>
<i>will go with that soup?</i>

196
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,663
First, mix The ingredients!

197
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,969
They're amateurs,
I thought so!

198
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,739
You can't make decent noodles
with that hand movement!

199
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,343
We practiced making noodles
all night!

200
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:39,080
But, we didn't make the noodles
we wanted to by morning...

201
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,645
Even so, we have to
make perfect noodles!

202
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,921
Hey hey. At least make us
something edible!

203
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:54,354
Quickly...

204
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,398
Uniformly...

205
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,000
Without discrepancies!

206
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,168
Next, knead it!

207
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,069
Hey, Sakura!

208
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,370
Look, it's K akashi Sensei.

209
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,640
Don't play!

210
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:08,472
Oh...

211
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,807
Sakura...

212
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:19,088
Oww! Sakura, you just can't control
your own crazy strength!

213
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,623
It's your fault for playing around
at a time like this!

214
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:27,830
This is...

215
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,097
This is...
the last of the ingredients.

216
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,941
No problem. This time, let us
show you we'll succeed!

217
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,739
Okay, I'm mixing.

218
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,574
Wait Choji! Leave this to me!

219
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:44,747
Naruto...

220
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,316
Hey, Sakura...

221
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:46,941
Huh?

222
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:50,154
We are Shinobi, right?

223
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:55,088
So then... Let's show them
the Ninja way to make noodles!

224
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:58,119
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

225
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,941
Rasengen! " Ichiraku version!

226
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:19,181
Wh What?! Mixing ingredients
with Chakra?!

227
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:27,650
No, that way he'll surely be able
to mix the ingredients uniformly!

228
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,320
And in micro units!

229
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,131
Sakura!

230
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:37,797
What?

231
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,938
Pervy Sage.

232
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,107
Naruto!

233
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,176
Cha!

234
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,684
Wh What's this crazy strength...?!

235
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:57,518
If she does that,
the noodles will become super firm!

236
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,993
Okay, Sakura!

237
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,396
Choji!

238
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,631
I, too... am a Shinobi of Leaf Village!

239
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,558
Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!

240
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,443
What?!

241
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:23,040
<i>What outstanding noodles!</i>

242
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:27,914
<i>If those noodles are added to</i>
<i>Teuchi's soup, this match would...</i>

243
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,720
<i>W We cannot lose!</i>

244
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,659
<i>It's for the future of the Ninja Chef!</i>

245
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,597
Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!

246
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,890
Okay! Leave it to me!

247
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,591
Wait a minute!

248
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,696
When the ramen is done...

249
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,034
Who will you serve it to first?

250
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,973
Huh? Who?

251
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:55,839
Th That's right...
That's how it is!

252
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:57,443
That's how what is?

253
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:59,482
Among the chefs...

254
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,985
there's a cardinal rule
not to be forgotten.

255
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:06,424
The first guest to arrive is
the first guest served!

256
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,621
No matter how delicious
the food you make is...

257
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:12,858
if you break this cardinal rule,
you're disqualified as a chef!

258
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,796
True, if a guy who came later
were eating before me,

259
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,360
then it would seriously pisses me off.

260
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,399
There are 100 Ninja Chefs here...

261
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:25,142
They all showed up at about
the same time!

262
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,045
So you have to serve ramen
to 100 people at the same time!

263
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,749
You're four people...

264
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:35,344
Can you really serve at
the same time?

265
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,983
I said we're Ninja, didn't I?

266
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,082
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

267
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,228
What?!

268
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:56,635
Now! Lift them!

269
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,579
- Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
- Thanks for waiting. Here you go!

270
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,046
- Oh...
- Oh...

271
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:14,184
Th The taste is the issue!
If you don't satisfy us, you lose!

272
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,738
Delicious!

273
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,840
- Delicious!
- Delicious!

274
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,735
I've never had ramen this delicious.

275
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,345
So then...

276
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:38,982
We win!

277
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,181
- We did it!
- We did it!

278
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,579
The truth is...

279
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:47,021
We Ninja Chefs are at
the end of our rope...

280
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:48,719
End of your rope?

281
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,019
What do you mean by that?

282
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:56,667
We endeavored to make
delicious meals to eat during missions...

283
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,999
We thought to make delicious food,
to fill your stomach...

284
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:01,369
that can be eaten anywhere...

285
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,478
But we pursued taste too far.

286
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,077
It was too delicious, people were
compelled to overeat.

287
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,512
And as a result...

288
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:22,256
Ninja gained weight,
and it interfered with their missions.

289
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,759
And some people are now saying,

290
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,560
"we don't need
the Ninja Chefs anymore.

291
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,260
- Oh...
- Oh...

292
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:32,437
For us Ninja Chefs
to continue,

293
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:35,473
we had to get tour hands on
the "phantom recipe out there

294
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,168
in the cooking world!

295
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:38,598
Recipe?

296
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,802
If we use this recipe,

297
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:44,645
we can improve the performance
of Shinobi without causing a burden.

298
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,818
There's such recipe...?

299
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,383
I hear, it's called
"the scum recipe."

300
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,484
- The scum recipe?!
- The scum recipe?!

301
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,588
We've gathered information
from everywhere...

302
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:55,823
As a result,

303
00:18:55,894 --> 00:19:00,058
we learned that the scum recipe
was at "Ichiraku" which Teuchi run.

304
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:01,190
- What?!
- What?!

305
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,792
I I don't know!

306
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,632
There's no reason something like that
should be at my shop!

307
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,261
There's someone who heard it!

308
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,968
I've got "the scum recipe"
at my shop, so...

309
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:14,072
Oh... Teuchi...?

310
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,373
Oh. I might have that.

311
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,475
Are you serious?!

312
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,009
I thought so!

313
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,282
To be precise...
It's the "scum removal recipe."

314
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,547
- Scum removal?
- Scum removal?

315
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,893
The trick to making delicious soup...

316
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,725
is how well you
remove the scum.

317
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:33,922
So I, too, studied a lot.

318
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,834
Eventually, I worked out a recipe
that can remove the scum effectively.

319
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:42,567
Usually it's called
"the scum recipe for short...

320
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,905
I never thought that
this misunderstanding would arise.

321
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,240
That's a pretty big omission.

322
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,683
Geez. That's a stupid punch line...

323
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,876
We won the cooking match,

324
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:58,115
so keep your promise
and return Ayame!

325
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,057
That's right! Where is she?!

326
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,621
Father!

327
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,192
Aya... me?

328
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,398
Ayame... is that you?

329
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:16,040
Can't you tell by looking?

330
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:19,100
B-But Ayame is like...

331
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:28,913
The food they make is
so delicious, I overeat...

332
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,511
Did I gain that much weight?

333
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:31,951
Ayame!

334
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,023
Ichiraku's new menu?

335
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,925
The thing we made
at the cooking challenge?

336
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,567
No, a diet ramen
that's popular among girls.

337
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,237
Diet Ramen?

338
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,071
It's super popular!

339
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:57,305
Oh, come on in, Naruto.

340
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,807
You've regained
your former shape...

341
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,047
It's thanks to my father's
diet ramen!

342
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:05,050
Huh? Where's your father?

343
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:09,520
Well... While he was joining me
in eating the diet ramen...

344
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,494
Hey... Naruto.

345
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,568
That's a little too thin, believe it.

346
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,217
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

347
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,018
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

348
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,624
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

349
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,627
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

350
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,689
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

351
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,267
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

352
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,527
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

353
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,403
<i>The images.</i>

354
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:02,413
<i>It probably will not end</i>

355
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,809
<i>It probably will not end</i>

356
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,658
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

357
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,684
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

358
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,729
<i>Running freely</i>

359
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,359
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

360
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,460
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

361
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:29,439
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

362
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:36,044
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

363
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,316
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

364
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

365
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,090
Does anyone have anything
to ask about this mission?

366
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:53,892
I've got a question!

367
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,762
Why should I have to go on
a mission with this group?

368
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,995
Okay, let's move on.
Everyone ready?

369
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,128
Hey, I've got a question, believe it!

370
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,229
As for the mission details,

371
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:02,967
we're to eliminate the Demon of the Ocean
in the Land of Oceans.

372
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,440
You guys are going to get
fired up for me

373
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,806
since you came to serve under me!

374
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:07,444
Just a minute.
Hey, listen to me!

375
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,843
Now, let's get g oing!

376
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,312
Stop complaining and
just come with me!

377
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:13,374
Listen to me, I say.
Listen! Listen! Listen!

378
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:16,109
