1
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:21,722
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:26,532
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,164
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,765
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:36,370
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:46,288
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:55,659
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:15,917
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:21,048
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,716
Our mission this time around
is a rough one.

12
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:52,120
Can you do it, Lee?

13
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,121
I'll be okay! I can go anytime.

14
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,091
Now that's my prot!

15
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,920
Let's go, Lee!

16
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,794
Right, Guy Sensei!

17
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,663
They're off!

18
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:15,407
Those large bags no doubt mean
an overnight expedition mission.

19
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,016
To think we'd encounter the ideal pair
so quickly. We're lucky.

20
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,443
Then, it's settled.

21
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,149
Right. Starting operation.
To infilrtra... whoa!

22
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:35,989
H-Heavy! Get off, you idiot.

23
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,029
To... infiltrate... the super elite
hidden village...

24
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,666
the Village Hidden in Leaves!

25
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:51,745
<i>The Appearance of Strange Visitors</i>

26
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:56,209
Wow, we look just like those two!

27
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:06,161
Naturally. We refined
our Disguise Jutsu for this very day.

28
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:08,930
We're after the classified information
of the Leaf...

29
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:11,498
Right!

30
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,037
We'll be famous if this goes well!

31
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:16,766
The idea is to win distinction
for our village.

32
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:21,376
Then we'll get tons of missions
and we'll be the village heroes!

33
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:27,640
Village Heroes!
Mondai and Poccha!

34
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,915
All right. As of this moment,
my name's Guy.

35
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,023
The Leaf Ninja, "Mondai Guy"!

36
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,520
And I'm the prot, "Poccha Lee"!

37
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:37,959
Let's go, Lee.

38
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,652
Yes, Guy Sensei!

39
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,666
Nothing like a large village,
sure enough!

40
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:56,142
Wow, everyone's like a Ninja.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,544
Hey! Don't be looking all
about so much!

42
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:00,447
Oww...

43
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:01,313
Listen up.

44
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:04,715
There's a chief in this village
called the "Hokage."

45
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:07,882
So there's no doubt classified information
is concentrated where that person is.

46
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:08,922
I see.

47
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:10,423
If I remember correctly,

48
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,928
that person's in a building easy to spot
with a " Fire mark on it or something...

49
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,004
- There it is!
- That's it!

50
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,206
What about the Lady Hokage's house?

51
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,364
- <i>Yikes!</i>
- <i>Yikes!</i>

52
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,372
Hi.

53
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:31,645
N Nothing special! We're not after Leaf
classified information or any any any...

54
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:32,977
Are you an idiot?!

55
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,681
I It's nothing at all!

56
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,013
Is that so?

57
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:40,156
Look, we've got to act naturally here.

58
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:41,418
R-Right...

59
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,458
Hi. I'm Guy.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm Lee.

61
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,262
Guy and Lee..., eh...?

62
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,863
Don't you guys have
a different atmosphere than usual?

63
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,194
No. L-It's your imagination!

64
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:56,463
No, I feel like something's different...

65
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:01,300
Oh, there's a kite up there flying
while eating a pork cutlet rice bowl!

66
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:05,477
What? Where, where?

67
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,849
What? There's no kite anywhere.

68
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,381
Hey, what?

69
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,853
Jeez, that Ninja has to go and
stand behind us

70
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,555
without any sign of his presence.

71
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,290
But it seems we fooled him good.

72
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,591
Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect,
sure enough.

73
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:30,100
Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isn't it?!

74
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:32,142
The Leaf isn't worth fearing!

75
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:39,047
Guy and Lee imposters are
prowling around the village?

76
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:41,207
And to think they'd enter the village
in disguises

77
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,980
without even using Transformation Jutsu.

78
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,884
Are they really Ninja?

79
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,382
Weird people find their way
in when a village grows.

80
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,691
Well, it's nonsense, but I thought
I would at least report it for now.

81
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,730
Indeed, we can't just leave
intruders unchecked.

82
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,429
Shall we throw them out?

83
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,568
No, leave them be.

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,206
What?

85
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,699
It sounds interesting, doesn't it?

86
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,240
They're going to the trouble of
calling themselves Ninja of this village.

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,212
But...

88
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,277
We probably don't need to worry.

89
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:18,014
It's unlikely that anyone could be
fooled by such obvious imposters.

90
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:24,420
Come on, please.
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!

91
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:29,664
Pretty please with sugar on top!
Just the one day today would be fine!

92
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,928
Let me join your training!

93
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,535
Hey! What's with this guy
all of a sudden?

94
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,799
He's probably a real acquaintance
of theirs, but...

95
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,975
Does he think
we're going to do training?!

96
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,414
I'll do anything! I've always
been interested in Taijutsu.

97
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:49,577
I mean... okay?! It's okay, right?

98
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,619
Anyway, let's turn him away!

99
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:52,211
Right!

100
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,787
No. Take a pass.

101
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,788
What? Why?!

102
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,454
Because our training is very harsh,
rough and difficult.

103
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,029
Difficult training, huh?

104
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,602
Ahhh, I'm getting even
more fired up! Please!

105
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:11,971
I won't get in your way,
no matter what! Come on.

106
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:14,611
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

107
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:17,145
All right, since it's come to this!

108
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:18,879
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

109
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,618
Real body clones?!

110
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:23,751
- And furthermore...
- And furthermore...

111
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:25,682
- Harem Jutsu!
- Harem Jutsu!

112
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,080
Wh What?!

113
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,127
- What?!
- What?!

114
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,366
- Pl-ea -se.
- Pl-ea -se.

115
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:42,967
- Okay!
- Okay!

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,899
What?!

117
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:46,632
Yes!

118
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,302
- No way.
- No way.

119
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,044
Brother, why'd you say okay?

120
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,247
What's done is done,
so it can't be helped, right?!

121
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,915
Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!

122
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,514
What's the deal, you two?

123
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,859
We're going to the farm today, right?

124
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,292
Farm?

125
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,426
What're you doing letting
your mind wander?

126
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:10,399
The person's waiting.
Come on, hurry!

127
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,059
- Huh? Oh...
- H-Hey!

128
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:14,197
Hey, wait!

129
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,234
- What...?
- Huh?

130
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:21,006
I promised to plant rice for
the sake of training?

131
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,878
Not only that, all of this...

132
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,375
It's totally huge.

133
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:29,116
Gee, thanks. It's a big help,
you guys giving me a hand.

134
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:30,776
Please don't worry about it.

135
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:34,654
They accepted this on
their own accord, so. Bye.

136
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,588
Why is this training?

137
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:41,762
I get it!

138
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,335
<i>Indeed, I will use my body quite</i>
<i>a bit if I do this training.</i>

139
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:48,333
<i>So I can get in shape</i>
<i>while helping out, huh?</i>

140
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,937
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!

141
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,542
I'll do my best!

142
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:56,241
Why's he that motivated?

143
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,841
Why should we have
to do this manual labor?

144
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,012
Damn it.
Anyway, let's get this over with!

145
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:04,051
You're right.

146
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,486
Th That's mean, brother!

147
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,290
Oh, sorry about that.

148
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,496
What?

149
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:22,663
Poccha?!

150
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:28,302
Come to think of it, there are
flying leeches in the rice fields,

151
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:29,709
so be careful.

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,305
F-Flying leeches?!

153
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,018
Worst case scenario, it could be deadly.

154
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,855
Yikes.

155
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:48,160
Hey Poccha!

156
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,524
Hang in there!

157
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,540
Just what I'd expect of Taijutsu training!

158
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,744
That was some intense rice planting!

159
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,081
Phew, that was a good workout!

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,751
W We're done...

161
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,585
Th That was life or death...

162
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,456
Then, shall we move on?

163
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:23,965
- A manure receptacle?!
- A manure receptacle?!

164
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,658
Spread this in that field over there.

165
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:30,672
Th This is also training...?

166
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,143
H-Heavy... Smelly...

167
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,506
Why should I have to do
something like this...?

168
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:45,152
Hey, you guys,
why don't you walk straight?

169
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,187
Y-You can walk twice
the forward progress distance

170
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,625
if you move ahead while
walking left and right like this!

171
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:54,021
Oh, so that was it?

172
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,391
Then I'll also...

173
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,030
Like this?

174
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:02,370
I It's really hard to balance like this!

175
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,536
D-Damn it!

176
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:10,879
Gee, I didn't realize at all that
there was a method of training like this...

177
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:13,211
Hey! Watch it.
Walk more over there...

178
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,007
What'd you say?

179
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:41,473
What a nightmare.

180
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,106
Forget about it.
Anyway, let's lose the kid right now.

181
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,482
As for you guys,
you still kind of smell bad.

182
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:50,813
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

183
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:53,587
There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.

184
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,180
Oh, Sakura.

185
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,384
Oh, Naruto. You're here, too?

186
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,933
As for me,
I'm training together with these two today.

187
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,400
R-Really?

188
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,399
More importantly, is something up?

189
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,635
Yeah... Actually, I really wanted
your help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.

190
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:12,538
- What?
- What?

191
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,878
- Your laundry blew away in the wind?
- Your laundry blew away in the wind?

192
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:19,504
That's right.
It got caught in a bit of a high spot.

193
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:23,649
No. No way, no way.
We've got lots of work to do, so.

194
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:24,615
Come on!

195
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,650
Here I'm asking precisely
because it's you guys.

196
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,656
Please don't say no!

197
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:35,396
Sakura, if you're in that much trouble,
I could get it for you!

198
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,565
Okay, Guy Sensei?

199
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:40,694
Okay?!

200
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:42,668
Sure.

201
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:51,378
What a sheer cliff.

202
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:55,176
That's for sure. We'd be beyond help
if we were to fall from up there.

203
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:57,717
Right? I don't quite have the confidence...

204
00:12:58,922 --> 00:12:59,547
That means...

205
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:02,889
Yup! It's right above here.

206
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:18,366
Gee, as one would expect,
I don't think we could...

207
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,271
Isn't that great, Sakura?

208
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,571
For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is
no different than a flat path.

209
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,410
That's encouraging.

210
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:30,449
It's a big help having an awesome Ninja
like you close by, Guy Sensei.

211
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,917
What? Uhh... Umm...

212
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:36,388
Now, please.

213
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:38,550
Brother...

214
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,494
Damn it. Why is this happening

215
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,329
I I don't want to die.

216
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,830
D-Damn it!

217
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:53,531
Hey, as for you guys,
why aren't you using the Chakra suction?

218
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:57,578
Th This is training for building up
muscular strength!

219
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,472
So that's what it was?!

220
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,647
Just what I'd expect of a Taijutsu user.

221
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:05,584
I never came up with deliberately
draining physical strength!

222
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:09,049
I really do learn a lot from
being with you, Sensei.

223
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>Th This jerk...</i>

224
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:12,224
I'm... I'm going to die...

225
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,023
Alley oop!

226
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:14,623
No!

227
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,699
Th That was close...!

228
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,529
Gee, sorry about that.

229
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,629
<i>This jerk...</i>

230
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,581
All right, we made it.

231
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:37,945
Don't look down!

232
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:41,122
Anyway, if we can just take
this back with us...

233
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,453
Alley oop...

234
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:43,356
Damn it...

235
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:45,621
All right, I got it.

236
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:50,028
It won't come loose...
Hey, help me out here.

237
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,397
R-Right...

238
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:57,535
You little...!

239
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,505
Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!

240
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,912
This is nothing to me!

241
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,276
Look out!

242
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:15,154
For real? What?!

243
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,922
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!

244
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:28,629
I've had it...

245
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,004
Sensei, Bushy Brow!

246
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,733
That was awesome!

247
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:38,138
To do something like not
using Chakra suction. Awesome!

248
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:39,509
- Look you...!
- Look you...!

249
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,448
Perfect timing, you guys.

250
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,080
Old Lady Tsunade.

251
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,782
Actually, I've got something
I want to ask you guys to do.

252
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,920
My companion suddenly started
not feeling well, you see.

253
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:54,996
- Yikes! It's huge!
- It's huge!

254
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,129
It seems she's caught a cold.

255
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:02,363
It's a huge slug. Oh, as for this,
is it something like Chief Toad?

256
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,067
Well, that sounds about right.

257
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:08,904
However, as you can see,
we can't carelessly move her.

258
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,738
Sorry, but could you guys look
after her for a while?

259
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,581
I'm very sorry.

260
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,593
Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.

261
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,760
Brother, at this rate we won't be able
to look for the confidential information.

262
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,198
Oh, that's right.

263
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,699
Shut up.

264
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,694
What're you moaning about?

265
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:44,641
You guys.

266
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,383
It couldn't be that you guys

267
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,543
can't listen to the words of me,
the Hokage, could it?

268
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,614
- <i>This is the Hokage?</i>
- <i>This is the Hokage?</i>

269
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:58,154
This is bad. To think the Hokage
was that fierce a person.

270
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:01,493
We're taking care of
her precious companion.

271
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,064
We might be able to get into
the Hokage estate surprisingly easily.

272
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:06,461
I wonder.

273
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,733
So even Summoning animals
get sick, too...

274
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,031
It seems to be a light cold.

275
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:17,342
My nose itches, I have a sore throat
and I feel weak or something...

276
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,943
Hey, I'm going to chill your forehead!

277
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:22,945
Thank you so much.

278
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,187
All right, here we go.

279
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:31,526
Oh... Oh no. The itching...

280
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:39,363
What?!

281
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,602
- Wha!
- What?!

282
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,343
It's... It's melting...

283
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,175
Watch it, you!

284
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,547
I'm very sorry. I'll be more caref

285
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,796
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!

286
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,732
You'll be in danger if you don't
move away from there!

287
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:14,803
My... My lower back...

288
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,395
Y You idiot!

289
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:21,001
I'm developing my dynamic vision
for narrowly evading danger!

290
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:21,973
Wha?

291
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,306
That Sensei,

292
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,109
he was training, putting his life
at risk even at times like this...?

293
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:31,313
Even though that Bushy Brow guy's
training properly, as for me!

294
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:38,484
I've woken up,
Guy Sensei, I'll train with you!

295
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:41,724
Let's do this!

296
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:49,271
Ohh, the joints in my body hurt...
I feel like I'm going to fall apart...

297
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:55,342
Hey! Aren't you a slug?
What're you doing talking about joints?!

298
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:02,241
- S Save us.
- S Save us!

299
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,593
I've had it.
What's going on with this village...?

300
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:14,157
I'll die if I stay in a place like this
any longer.

301
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:16,957
Withdraw...

302
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,164
Right.

303
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,834
Who're you guys?

304
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:32,012
Why are you dressed like
my prot Lee...?

305
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:33,349
Damn it!

306
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,777
Since it's come to this,
I don't give a damn anymore!

307
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:41,122
- Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
- Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!

308
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,916
I don't really get it, but it seems
we just have to fight, huh?

309
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,287
So it seems.

310
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:47,693
Let's go, Lee!

311
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:48,991
Now, knockout technique!

312
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,394
- Double Dynamic Entry!
- Double Dynamic Entry!

313
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:58,468
Damn it. What did we go there for
in the end?!

314
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,901
I really hate, I really hate...

315
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,877
- the likes of the Leaf!
- The likes of the Leaf!

316
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,646
Tamaya!

317
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,084
Lord knows where they came from,

318
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,818
but now they'll probably never
want to try that again.

319
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,018
You sure looked like
you were having fun, Lady Tsunade,

320
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,721
going so far as to summon Katsuyu.

321
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:23,932
Well, my adorable Genin
helped out as well, so.

322
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:30,069
Now, we've had our breather.
So please be getting back to work.

323
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,466
Oh yes, ma'am.

324
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:35,466
But still...
What was with that Naruto?

325
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:38,306
To think he seriously believed
those two were for real.

326
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,780
What was that all about?

327
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,712
Who knows...?

328
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,245
Hey!

329
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,013
Naruto.

330
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:47,520
- Someone who looked just like me now...
- Man, you guys got separated.

331
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,251
I didn't know what to do.

332
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,926
As for me, I was impressed!

333
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:55,590
- You guys were really cool earlier!
- Huh?

334
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,897
I've learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu
or something...

335
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,936
Alot happened, but I'll continue
training right away!

336
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,100
Continue training?

337
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:08,769
So come on, let's continue
the Taijutsu training!

338
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:15,774
Moron, moron, moron.

339
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:41,805
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

340
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:53,383
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

341
00:21:54,125 --> 00:22:04,694
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

342
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:16,879
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

343
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:28,323
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

344
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:39,868
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

345
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:45,633
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

346
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:55,851
Damn it! Why should a Ninja have
to do something like get rid of a ghost?!

347
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,250
We have no choice, right?
After all, a commission is a comission!

348
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:02,292
The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?!
