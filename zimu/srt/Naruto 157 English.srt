1
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:21,624
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,433
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:29,065
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,666
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,272
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:46,189
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:55,560
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,535 --> 00:01:06,342
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:15,819
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:20,949
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:47,943
<i>Run! The Curry of Life</i>

12
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,737
Why... do you go that far...?

13
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:15,311
I'll get so strong that Guy Sensei
can look at me with a smile...

14
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,573
That is my Way of Ninja!

15
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:25,215
I see... So you live for the sake
of Guy or whatever...

16
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:31,062
Then have that Guy person
give you a funeral!

17
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:36,091
I'm sure he'll think of your hard work
and cry for you!

18
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:47,172
Ninja Art...

19
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:55,412
Thunder Dragon Tornado!

20
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,889
One, two!

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,326
Mom, don't push!
I can't run that fast!

22
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:16,538
Oh my, this isn't the time
for complaining!

23
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,319
Please, hurry!

24
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,156
I'll go on ahead, okay?!

25
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,159
Oh my!

26
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:56,173
Where'd he disappear to...?
Has he evaporated to the bone...?

27
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,025
Hey! Hang in there!

28
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,328
One, two...!

29
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,565
One, two...!

30
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,707
I've had it...

31
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,135
Grandma Sansho, the curry of life!

32
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:27,141
One...

33
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:30,677
Two!

34
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,611
I'll look after Lee.

35
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,954
So give Neji and Naruto
some curry!

36
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,258
Ranmaru, wait here.

37
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:44,554
Right.

38
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,764
I'm going to Naruto!
Please look after Lee.

39
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,703
You too, get your butt to Neji!

40
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,899
Oh... right, Mom.

41
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:04,706
Right... Open Lee's mouth.

42
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,250
Oh, right!

43
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,881
Here!

44
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,103
So even the curry of life
won't work, huh...?

45
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:33,874
Oh my!

46
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:37,910
Oh my...

47
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:42,776
You little...! This isn't the time
to be passing out!

48
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,522
Hot!

49
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,092
What're you doing, believe it?!

50
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,250
Are you awake?

51
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:53,624
Oh, Tenten?
Didn't you fall off the cliff?!

52
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,468
You should've realized
that was his trap!

53
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:01,172
What?! I was totally snow jobbed,
believe it!

54
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,602
Neji, Neji!

55
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:10,546
It's the curry of life!
Eat this and get better.

56
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,183
Neji?!

57
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,311
Neji!

58
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,528
Oh my, thank goodness he got better!

59
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:32,462
What?

60
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:45,613
The world is spinning...

61
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,009
He's acting kind of strange...

62
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,614
Oh my...

63
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,621
<i>One, two...</i>

64
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:56,357
<i>Put the curry of life in this,</i>
<i>pot and all.</i>

65
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,490
<i>Okay.</i>

66
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,431
<i>Hot!</i>

67
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:03,999
<i>Oww!</i>

68
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,408
<i>Oh! The curry...</i>

69
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:16,544
<i>This is bad!</i>

70
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,545
<i>Don't worry about it. Move it!</i>

71
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,119
On account of that wine...

72
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:28,423
Will he be okay?

73
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:34,289
Oh my, there's a slight problem
with the ingredients...

74
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,366
But there shouldn't be
much difference in efficacy.

75
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,335
But...

76
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:53,980
Oh my...!

77
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,310
He's coming this way.

78
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,320
It's okay! I'll go...

79
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,230
You're still alive?!
I have to finish you off...

80
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:14,367
Raigan.

81
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,735
You're alive, Ranmaru?!

82
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:23,505
It's Ranmaru!

83
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,586
That kid gave Raiga his own Chakra
and brought him back to life...

84
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:29,545
What?!

85
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:32,386
Raiga looked at Ranmaru
who was unconscious

86
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:35,616
and assumed he was dead...

87
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,785
So that's why he was saying
all that gibberish

88
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:41,355
about Ranmaru watching
from high above.

89
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:46,336
And I managed to get Ranmaru
to the Curry of Life Shop.

90
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:48,897
So that's what happened...

91
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,739
We'll again be together forever,
Ranmaru...

92
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:57,441
Let's kill them and have fun
doing lots of bad things.

93
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,508
Right, Raigan.

94
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:12,296
Some fog has appeared.

95
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:17,059
It's okay.
I'll be your eyes again, Raiga...

96
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:22,836
Right. There's nothing to be afraid of
if I'm with you, Ranmaru.

97
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:25,372
Now, let's go, Raiga!

98
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:27,602
What about them?

99
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,210
They're dead now...

100
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,418
Right... Shall we search
for our next prey?

101
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,558
But there's a precipitous cliff ahead!

102
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:48,223
That Ranmaru, what's he going to do?!

103
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,196
Could it be...

104
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:55,203
he's going to atone for the past sins
together with Raiga?!

105
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:59,637
He might be planning to lead Raiga
over that cliff and die together!

106
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:00,936
Wh What?!

107
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,079
What's with you, jerk?!

108
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:12,148
What?!

109
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:20,653
Lee...

110
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,308
Hey...

111
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:48,820
Here I go...!

112
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:56,965
What?!

113
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,234
You... brat!

114
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,446
He suddenly recovered!

115
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,583
Knock it off!

116
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,446
<i>He's fast!</i>

117
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:56,720
You okay, Ranmaru?

118
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,194
You stay here!

119
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,765
Take me with you...

120
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,340
Oh! Ranmaru!

121
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,339
Where'd you go, Ranmaru?!

122
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,547
You little! You're going to pay for this!

123
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,186
Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!

124
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:35,094
Now...

125
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,766
Bring it!

126
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,469
Knock it off!

127
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:42,903
Here I go...

128
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:04,385
That was a heck of a blow.

129
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:09,798
If I hadn't put on the Thunder Armor;
I'd be giving myself a funeral.

130
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:21,437
In order to remember your hard work
I'll give you your funeral myself!

131
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,208
Wait!

132
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:33,855
What's the idea...?

133
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,693
I want to feed you...
the curry of life, too.

134
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:41,159
Huh?!

135
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,334
You'll realize that you're not alone
if you eat the curry...

136
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:48,436
Everyone's feelings are blended in...

137
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,472
What're you saying?!

138
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:53,942
Let's stop hurting people...

139
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:56,046
Cut it out!

140
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:59,141
You're my eyes and ears!

141
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:04,717
We'll no longer be two people in one
if you say such selfish things!

142
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,858
Shoot your lightning...

143
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:14,131
If I die, the strong Raiga will also die...
We're two in one, so...

144
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:23,466
I... won't be able to remember you
from when you were cool...

145
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,401
I must give you a funeral!

146
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,020
Stop... Raiga!

147
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,988
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

148
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,202
There are lots of Narutos...

149
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,968
Did I get drunk?

150
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:09,748
You little! It makes no difference,
no matter how many of you there are!

151
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,452
Neji, wake up!

152
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,885
What're you doing, Neji?

153
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:24,367
Eat this and get it together!
We've got trouble here!

154
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,593
That's...

155
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,169
What?!

156
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:34,569
Now we've done it...

157
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:40,713
You're going to kill by your own hand
the friend who risked his life to save you?!

158
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:43,781
Wha?! Ranmaru betrayed me...

159
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,990
He broke the promise for it
to be just us two forever!

160
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:50,987
He's not all alone anymore!

161
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,856
He figured out that it's more fun...

162
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:58,232
to laugh with everyone
than to cry with you!

163
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:00,169
Naruto...

164
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,937
Ranmaru, you were going to die
with Raiga, weren't you?!

165
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,701
Don't be thinking about
something like that anymore!

166
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,772
You're free now!

167
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,644
Don't worry. I won't let Raiga
give you a funeral, no matter what!

168
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:17,916
Hey, don't be shooting off your mouth,
you shrimp.

169
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:19,587
Say what?!

170
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:24,951
Don't underestimate me.
I'm Raiga Kurosuki!

171
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,966
I've been counted before as one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

172
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,032
I won't take orders from
the likes of you!

173
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,605
Oh. That's right.
He's a Ninja Swordsman, huh?

174
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,041
If you're one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,

175
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,340
then I've got something to ask you.

176
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,775
You know the guy called Kisame, right?!

177
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:49,643
Kisame? I hate that guy!

178
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:53,848
So I'll give him a funeral for sure
the next time I see him!

179
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:54,751
What?!

180
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:55,885
I hate him.

181
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:01,061
I hate all the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist!

182
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:07,366
Ranmaru. You're the only one
who's a friend to me...

183
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:14,240
But Ranmaru...
you've made other friends...

184
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:19,610
We're not two in one anymore...

185
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:22,583
Raigan.

186
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,294
Impudent!

187
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:38,892
Who do you think taught you
about the outside world?!

188
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:44,106
It's a funeral for you!

189
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,568
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

190
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,438
You little...

191
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,871
Clone... Body Slam!

192
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:34,884
<i>Ranmaru...</i>

193
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,794
Now you're free...

194
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:44,630
Raiga?!

195
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:53,844
Thunder! Give me my funeral!

196
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,977
One, two... One...

197
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:31,111
Not loud enough!

198
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:34,446
- You can't make genuine curry of life...
- One, two...

199
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,919
- if you don't stir it with all your heart!
- One, two...

200
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,283
Oh my!

201
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:42,451
Ouch... What're you doing, Mom?!

202
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:44,660
Oh my, Karashi!

203
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:49,899
It's a hundred years too soon for you
to be uttering the word "genuine"!

204
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,902
You too, start your training over again
from the beginning!

205
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:55,670
What?!

206
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,902
Grandma Sansho!

207
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,401
We'll be leaving now!

208
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:01,975
Thanks for your help.

209
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,578
I leave Ranmaru to you!

210
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,951
Oh my... I'll train him mercilessly
as a successor...

211
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,511
to the preparation of the curry of life!

212
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,148
Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.

213
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:17,658
- Thanks!
- Thanks!

214
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:24,463
Oh my... It's a long way
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.

215
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:27,032
I made you guys some special curry

216
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:29,595
that'll give you guys ten thousand times
the strength.

217
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,402
Be on your way after having some.

218
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:39,742
What's this very spicy looking
bright red color...?

219
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,712
It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!

220
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,255
Oh! That looks good!

221
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,621
- What? Seriously?!
- What? Seriously?!

222
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,694
Lady Tsunade will get mad at us
if we don't get back soon!

223
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,389
You're right!

224
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:56,524
Unfortunately, we'll have to be going now.

225
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:58,493
Wait!

226
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:07,870
Oh my, those kids were sure
diffident and reserved...

227
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,741
The curry... The curry...!

228
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:41,972
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

229
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:53,550
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

230
00:21:54,292 --> 00:22:04,861
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

231
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:17,046
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

232
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:28,489
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

233
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:40,035
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

234
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:45,799
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

235
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,045
One's duty as team captain:

236
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:54,982
"Issue appropriate instructions
to the subordinates,

237
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:58,021
protect the lives of your men and
promptly carry out your mission."

238
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:01,157
Awesome, that is so cool!

239
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:05,719
This is so perfect for me, Naruto, the man
who will eventually become a Hokage!

240
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,957
All right, I'll use this to instantly get closer
to the title of Hokage, believe it!

241
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:15,495
Next time: " Follow My Lead!
The Great Survival Challenge!
