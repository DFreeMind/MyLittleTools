The great Jiraya… is not the type that runs behind the beautiful women! They are not cos ì  stupid.

36
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,996
When you arrive to my age....

37
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,041
The women impazziranno for your fascination.

38
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:30,067
Ah? When that woman has made the occhiolino you seems to you a fish lesso…

39
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,861
You would not have to make the fico so much, Ero-Sennin.

40
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,199
It goes well… but you stop it to call to me in that way before all.

41
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,201
It is zitto!

42
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:43,080
We speak of other. These tizi are dangerous, Ero-Sennin.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,748
Eh? Ero-Sennin?

44
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,084
You stop it to call Ero-Sennin to me.

45
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:56,134
Not me wonder that you are one of the three leggendari Sannin, Jiraiya-sama…

46
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,972
Even if a six greatest lover of the women....

47
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,601
I was sure that we would not be resolutions to distrarti more than a lot.

48
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,147
You know the true identity of Ero-Sennin?

49
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:15,028
Beh… is not that I have one true identity and one false....

50
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:21,285
However… it seems that you have cancelled the Genjutsu that we had made that woman.

51
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,792
In order to remove to me from Naruto…

52
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,296
Thanks to the Sharingan you have used a Genjutsu on this poor woman…

53
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,757
E' truly an attitude from codardi.

54
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,260
To remove?

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,762
Why they have made it?

56
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,099
Then is truly Naruto your objective?

57
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,275
Your objective…

58
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,486
E' the one which has within Naruto, the Kyubi, true?

59
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,865
Why here Kakashi-saint it was some to the current…

60
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,075
You are …

61
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,412
The source of the information, you are.

62
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,208
"You take Naruto with you "

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,294
These are the orders of our organization, Akatsuki.

64
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,630
E' one mission of extreme importance.

65
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,258
What is saying?

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,980
You will not carry Naruto from no part.

67
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,567
We will see…

68
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,569
Much good.

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,449
I will personally get rid  of you two, just now.

70
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,867
Not interfered…

71
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,465
What that man will kill…

72
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,387
They are I!

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,893
Episode #85
Stupid fratellino. Hatred and depreciation!

74
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,603
Sasuke…

75
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,564
Vendetta?

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,285
I do not have time to lose now with you.

77
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,371
You close that mouth!

78
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,586
Sasuke !

79
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,841
Eternal damnation!

80
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,842
Naruto !

81
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,178
T' I have said not to interfere!

82
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,435
As you have said to me …

83
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,356
They are survivor until to hour…

84
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,984
Waiting for this moment!

85
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:26,637
Sasuke!

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:35,938
Not still…

87
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,067
It more does not succeed neanche to form seals with the hands.

88
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,697
This is… my combat!

89
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Much good…

90
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,664
You have felt, not?

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,500
This is their combat!

92
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,294
We do not have to interfere.

93
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,015
You take this!

94
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:18,814
Why?

95
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,912
The difference between of we is remained the same one then… How it is possible?

96
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,499
Without mercy, eh?

97
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,718
Which thing I have made… until now?

98
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,514
What I have made?

99
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,108
A six weak person.

100
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,944
You want to know why?

101
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,697
Why it lacks to you …

102
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,782
…  hatred!

103
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,132
This is…?

104
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,292
This is…

105
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,710
It can  be?

106
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,053
Exactly…

107
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,642
This is our house.

108
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,230
Madre! Father!

109
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,450
A six weak person.

110
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,579
For next the 24 hours…

111
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,955
Stopped.

112
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,418
You will see again the scene of that day…

113
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,756
Stopped!

114
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,660
Uncle, Aunt.

115
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,624
You merits not to die.

116
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,376
Stupid fratellino.

117
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,712
If you have intention to kill to me.

118
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,965
You curse to me, hates to me.

119
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,802
You survive in this atrocious world.

120
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,013
You run, you run.

121
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,557
It grabs hold of you to your life.

122
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,942
Cruel like always…

123
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,861
Infernal World of the Moon has used the Tsukiyomi on its brother ( )

124
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,996
Now you stop it! Bastard!

125
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,018
That… that he happens?

126
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,022
Ninpou: Gamaguchi Shibari
(Trap of the stomach of Rospo)

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,038
Me dispiace for you… Itachi, Kisame. Found within to my stomach now.

128
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,918
I have evoked the esophagus of a rospo giant of the caverns of the Yougoku mount.

129
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,380
However you are two criminal ones you search to you…

130
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,634
You will be an optimal food for the rospo of mountains.

131
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,515
What… What devil is?

132
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,310
Naruto, you are calm!

133
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,480
Not to worry to you, this is one my technique.>.

134
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,400
Kisame, we go!

135
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:28,040
Useless E'. Nobody is never successful to scappare from here, up to now.

136
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,466
The muscle walls are being closed.

137
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,899
They are faster than we.

138
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,900
At this rate…

139
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,329
But…

140
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:08,997
Ero-Sennin

141
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,459
What happens?

142
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,589
They are you escape yourself.

143
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,974
I cannot believe that they are resolutions to penetrate these walls.

144
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,647
Why we are withdrawing?

145
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,607
You could…

146
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,778
Not there is haste, Naruto still is not dangerous.

147
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:46,285
Moreover I must be stopped from some part in order to rest.

148
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,919
I have used the Tsukiyomi, and have been forced to use also the Amaterasu
[  Amaterasu = God of the Sun  ]

149
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,640
What is these flames?

150
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,601
They are black!

151
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,602
Not to approach to you too much!

152
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,443
How devil is resolutions to scappare?

153
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,486
Moreover…

154
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,907
What is those black flames?

155
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,870
As it is possible to burn the stomach of Iwagama that normally sputa flames.... (Name of the rospo of Mountains)

156
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,092
Well!

157
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,764
Fuin Jutsu: Fuukahouin
[  Technical sealing: Control of Flames  ]

158
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,501
Well!

159
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,171
Hour would have to be lies in wait for.

160
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,215
Hour we must be taken care of Sasuke.

161
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,745
Sasuke …

162
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,258
Dynamic Entry! (Scenografica Entrance)

163
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,441
Dispiace to have to me to you hit.

164
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,028
I went of haste, and I have forgotten my small mirror.

165
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,200
I have used mine coprifronte, but it is not the same one.

166
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,660
I have confused your shadow for that one of an enemy…

167
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,371
I have left to go my impetuous combative spirit, and I have not made attention …

168
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,372
Me dispiace.

169
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,376
These would have to be your excuses?

170
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,588
They are not Bravo with the words…

171
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,090
Vabbè, lasciamo to lose…

172
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,385
Sasuke door from the medical square.

173
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,386
!

174
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,431
It has an arm and the fractured ribs…

175
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,645
Moreover, it has endured a mental attack from a Dojutsu and has lost acquaintance. (Dojutsu: Technique with the eyes)

176
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,982
Also he that technique?

177
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,362
Ero-Sennin, Sasuke Will recover?

178
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,992
It seems that it has endured serious psychological damages.

179
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:20,332
I will kill  to you!

180
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,591
You die !

181
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,951
It leaves me …

182
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,952
