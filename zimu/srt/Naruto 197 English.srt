1
00:00:01,253 --> 00:00:03,551
<i>Rock away your existence,</i>

2
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:06,386
<i>Shouting that you are here...</i>

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:12,488
<i>A new journey begins now.</i>

4
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:28,947
<i>As we survived through</i>
<i>the changing seasons,</i>

5
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:34,384
<i>we gained knowledge and strength,</i>
<i>(just looks like a survival game)</i>

6
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,081
<i>But the forgotten memories,</i>

7
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:40,592
<i>of the feelings abandoned within</i>
<i>the flows of time,</i>

8
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:45,119
<i>have also been lost.</i>

9
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:51,759
<i>When sinking down,</i>
<i>we learned loneliness.</i>

10
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>But now we've met each other,</i>
<i>we are no longer alone.</i>

11
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:02,245
<i>Unveil your feelings,</i>
<i>Those high emotions</i>

12
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>Those tears will change your fate.</i>

13
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,813
<i>Pound your heartbeat</i>
<i>against the darkness,</i>

14
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:19,627
<i>We're sure to meet,</i>
<i>Under the same flag of pain</i>

15
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,926
Wow. There's a lot of new houses
being built around here.

16
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,499
I hear it's been a bit of
a construction boom recently.

17
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:00,799
Seems like a lot of the construction sites
are short handed

18
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:03,341
and they're hiring carpenters
from people outside of the country, too.

19
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,506
Even I know that.

20
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,209
Oh, Old Man Genno!

21
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:15,113
Oh... Naruto.

22
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,688
Who is he?

23
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,121
He's a carpenter from the Land of Sand.

24
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,721
He likes ramen, and we bump
into each other at Ichiraku.

25
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:25,387
How about we go there after this?

26
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:27,866
Yeah!

27
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:32,029
Here you go,
thanks for waiting!

28
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,397
Thank you for this meal!

29
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,731
Thank you.

30
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:42,413
Ichiraku's ramen is the best, after all!

31
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,211
Isn't it so? Isn't it so?

32
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,450
I'm sorry, but can I have some water...?

33
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,020
Sure!

34
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,055
Thank you for this meal!

35
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:52,123
That was fast!

36
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,056
Are you full already?

37
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,792
No... Not really...

38
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,025
Then, I'll give you mine.

39
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,192
Lucky!

40
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,028
Hey, Naruto!

41
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,527
The two of them are always like this.

42
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,533
They act as if they're really
grandfather and grandson.

43
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:12,735
Oh come on, Sakura,
stop being so harsh.

44
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,039
There're lots of other people
who complain. Like Grandma Tsunade.

45
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,614
And there's Shino, Ino, Kiba,
and Kakashi Sensei...

46
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,412
But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura.

47
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:22,611
Come on, Naruto!

48
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,685
That's only because
you're always at fault!

49
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:28,157
Now, now, Sakura calm down.
You hair will turn gray... Ouch!

50
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:29,960
- <i>Looks like it's time</i>
- Just leave it and eat up already!

51
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,256
- <i>I got to business...</i>
- But I got nothing left!

52
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,561
- Hey, hey.
- Help me, Old Man Genno!

53
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:39,363
<i>Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather</i>

54
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:56,588
Damn!

55
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,750
What is it? Fog?

56
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:06,260
Well, I guess it doesn't matter...

57
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:23,781
Lady Tsunade.

58
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,108
I'm sorry to bother you
during your sleep,

59
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,483
but the man that the Anbu Black Ops
have had marked...

60
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:31,723
Has made his move?

61
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,789
He is currently on the run.

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,827
On the run?

63
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,095
Are you telling me even with
the array of the Anbu Black Ops,

64
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:39,494
we still can't catch him?

65
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:41,864
Who is he?

66
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,492
You must know his identity by now.

67
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,329
There was nobody in
the recent Bingo Book

68
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:49,931
that fit his description,

69
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,340
but when we checked
an older Bingo Book...

70
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,915
Genno?

71
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,242
Genno the Trapper?

72
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:01,608
You do know of him?

73
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,521
He should be quite old by now.

74
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,952
I hadn't heard his name in a while,

75
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,424
so I thought that
he had already retired, but...

76
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:14,360
I never would have thought that
he was infiltrating the Leaf Village.

77
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:22,368
I guess I can't fight against old age.

78
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:29,039
No... I guess I should say this is just
what I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.

79
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,046
We want you to hand over the thing
you took from the master carpenter' house.

80
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:43,555
You think I would still be holding
onto that thing?

81
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,122
I've had a long life as a Shinobi...

82
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,093
I guess it wouldn't be so bad to
close the curtain at this time.

83
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,170
Though I regret that
I won't be able to see

84
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:54,762
the end of the Leaf Village
with my own eyes!

85
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:57,608
Paper Bombs!

86
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:58,643
Retreat!

87
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,218
Are you saying that someone

88
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,658
is planning a huge attack
against the Leaf Village?!

89
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,629
That would be the only reason
anyone would want those plans

90
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,563
besides carpentry purposes.

91
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:59,096
Genno's last words suggest that as well.

92
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,999
It's going to take some time
to decipher those plans,

93
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,235
but it's too dangerous to depend on that.

94
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,044
The enemy may
attack us any minute.

95
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,417
Activate the S Level Emergency
Security Alert!

96
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:17,178
Leave the least amount of
men necessary here,

97
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,655
and all other men are to secure
the border!

98
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:24,292
Attack anyone who tries to cross
the border!

99
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,191
Don't allow them to attack the village,
no matter what!

100
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,939
Such great weather!

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,107
Naruto!

102
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:38,139
Oh! Sakura!

103
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,203
That sound like a big pain in the ass.

104
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:47,917
I think you'll be able to do it.
That is why we left you in the village.

105
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,821
At the very least, is there any way
that we can get more people?

106
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:55,956
Under these circumstances,
we can't turn over more people to you.

107
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,895
They're the greatest line up for you,
aren't they?

108
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:01,731
The greatest... huh?

109
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:09,830
Fog? Last night's weather didn't seem
like it was going to be foggy.

110
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:13,905
How strange...
Was it all a dream?

111
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,911
Doesn't it seem like
we're really low on people?

112
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:23,854
That's what I was thinking, too.

113
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,851
From the looks of it,

114
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,256
the village must be
under special security alert.

115
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,758
What?! For real?!
I didn't notice it!

116
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,628
You should notice these kinds of things.
You're a Ninja.

117
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,032
But if we're in a state of emergency,

118
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,365
it's a huge deal for the village,
isn't it?

119
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:42,334
Why haven't they told us anything?

120
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,407
That's why Lady Tsunade is calling us.

121
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,413
Come in.

122
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,575
Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.

123
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,888
Shikamaru...

124
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,487
So you must've been left out, too.

125
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,289
Huh? What are you taking about?

126
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:05,186
Nothing...

127
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,025
Oh, hey Shikamaru.
About last night's weird fog...

128
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,598
Did you see it?

129
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,034
Stop it.
You were just dreaming.

130
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,928
There was no fog.

131
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:16,838
See. I told you...

132
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:18,703
That was a smoke screen.

133
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:20,311
Smoke screen?

134
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,844
I'll explain once
everyone gets here.

135
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:25,447
- Huh?
- Naruto, Sakura...

136
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,550
The reason why we left you out of

137
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,951
the S-Level Emergency
Security Alert unit

138
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,989
is because we wanted you
to work under Shikamaru

139
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:33,024
for a special mission.

140
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,358
What?

141
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:35,859
Well, that's the case.

142
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:39,530
First, I want you to gather
the people I'm about to name.

143
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,352
Hey, calm down, Naruto!

144
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,855
But it's already past the time
we w ere supposed to gather!

145
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,192
Not quite. To be accurate,
we still have twenty more seconds.

146
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,899
Seems like he's here.

147
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,934
Oh? Everyone's already here?

148
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,166
No matter how you look at it,
you're the last one!

149
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,906
Everyone's here now.
Then let's begin.

150
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,446
I'm sure that
you all have already noticed.

151
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:35,247
The village is currently under
the S-Level Emergency Security Alert.

152
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,454
It all started when...

153
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,080
The smoke screen last night, right?

154
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,516
You guys noticed it?

155
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,693
Of course.

156
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,096
The bugs were being noisy...

157
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,290
Huh? I didn't notice it.

158
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,300
You're always so out of it!

159
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,395
SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI!
<i>I didn't notice it either...</i>

160
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:56,038
WORSE THAN NARUTO!!
<i>Could it be then that</i>
<i>I'm worse than Naruto?</i>

161
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:58,632
<i>Worse than Naruto... Worse than</i>
<i>Naruto... Worse than Naruto...</i>

162
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:01,143
So what was that?

163
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,976
It seemed like something involving
the Anbu Black Ops.

164
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,107
So I stayed put...

165
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:08,543
Yeah, that's correct.
The Anbu Black Ops were involved.

166
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,211
Just as I thought...

167
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,217
It was late last night.

168
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:16,851
A man that the Anbu Black Ops had
been marking for the past two weeks

169
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:19,453
had snuck into the home of
Leaf Village's top carpenter boss...

170
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,466
And he stole the plans of our village's
important facilities from the secret safe.

171
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,299
Plans?

172
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:31,673
So what's so bad about that?

173
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,036
He just stole the plans
for the facilities, right?

174
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,646
Just stole? You're so...

175
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,676
Naruto...

176
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,515
For example, let's say the plans for
the fort that surrounds the village

177
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:44,816
fell into enemy hands...

178
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:49,960
By analyzing those plans in detail,

179
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,859
the enemy could figure out
the most efficient way

180
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,488
to break into the village.

181
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,735
Now let's say that there were
plans for Lady Tsunade's mansion.

182
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,362
If you were to examine those plans,

183
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:04,067
you could find out how
to get the Lady Tsunade's room.

184
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,641
And if the plans were to get
into the hands of an assassin...

185
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:11,304
That's really, really bad.

186
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,308
Last night's smoke screen was...

187
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:17,047
something that suspect spread
as he was running away.

188
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:18,889
I see...

189
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:22,552
In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him
in the Western Forest...

190
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,561
He killed himself before
they could get him to talk.

191
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,661
Unfortunately,
when he committed suicide,

192
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:34,705
he wasn't in possession
of the plans he had stolen.

193
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,907
If the plans have already fallen
into the hands of the enemy...

194
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:42,337
it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of
the Destruction of Leaf Village.

195
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,644
In order to prevent that from happening

196
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:48,277
The S-Level Emergency Security Alert
was deployed this morning.

197
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,850
So, what is the mission for those
of us who were left behind?

198
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:56,487
Find out the location of
the stolen plans and bring them back.

199
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,687
That's our mission.

200
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,563
It's like finding a needle in
a haystack.

201
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,325
We just need to investigate
the path he took

202
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,198
and people he was acquainted with.

203
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:10,198
It turns out that the guy was famous
for being a top level trap technician.

204
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:14,543
It's a huge possibility that
he left traps where the plans are.

205
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,205
It's definitely plausible.

206
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,949
I understand.
We'll follow your instructions.

207
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,785
I'll do it.

208
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,820
Then let's start the investigation.

209
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:31,124
Turns out that the man
had snuck into the village

210
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,993
a few months ago and worked
as a carpenter.

211
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,068
Th This guy...

212
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:43,365
His name is... Genno

213
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:47,845
You're kidding me.

214
00:13:54,485 --> 00:14:00,424
There's no way! Old Man Genno loved
the ramen at Ichiraku!

215
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:05,023
He would never do anything that
would destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!

216
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,992
Listen... There's no way that a guy
who's sneaking in to an enemy village

217
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,433
would show his bad side.

218
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,168
He played the part of a good guy
to let people's guard down.

219
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,671
There is no way that anyone
who loves ramen could be a bad person!

220
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,301
No. That's not true Naruto.

221
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:25,145
Choji... You tell him.
Put some sense into this guy.

222
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:29,818
Anyone who loves Ichiraku's ramen
can't be a bad person!

223
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,280
Choji!

224
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,524
Gosh, I can't depend on anybody...

225
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:39,593
This is a list of the stolen plans.

226
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:44,366
I'm so embarrassed
we lost our important plans...

227
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:47,030
I can't show my face to Lady Tsunade.

228
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,465
Which construction jobs
were Genno involved with?

229
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:54,941
None of them.

230
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:57,913
But wasn't he working under you?

231
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:01,384
I don't allow outsiders to work
on any construction

232
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,044
that involves the safety of the village.

233
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:07,916
That old man only worked
on residential construction.

234
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:09,882
Which means...

235
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:13,158
There's little possibility that he
snuck some traps into the construction.

236
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,431
I think it's impossible.

237
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,731
We should check everything,
just in case...

238
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:20,371
I'm counting on you.

239
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,537
Lady Hinata, please take care of these.

240
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:25,843
Y Yes!

241
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:28,202
I'll go too.

242
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:29,480
Me too.

243
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,154
I've mentioned it earlier,
but there is a possibility

244
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,849
the the plans haven't fallen into
the enemy's hands yet.

245
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:44,325
It's possible that he could have hidden it
while he was running away.

246
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:48,188
And it's our mission to find that.

247
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,067
Understood.

248
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,771
It's the start of a treasure hunt.
I'm depending on you Akamaru.

249
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,846
Go!

250
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,394
Ino and Sakura, you guys go
check the old man's body.

251
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,687
There might be some clues.

252
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,158
What?! Us?

253
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:24,835
I got it.

254
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:28,572
All right! You just want me to go right?!
I'll go!

255
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:34,305
Sakura, are you really okay with this?

256
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,676
I have to be. I'm training to become
a Medical Ninja.

257
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:39,540
I can't be afraid of something like this.

258
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:42,345
That might be the case for you, but...

259
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,856
Now... master carpenter.

260
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:53,695
Can you tell us everything you know
about Old Man Genno?

261
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,002
The old man came to Leaf Village
about three months ago...

262
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,504
He came to my place with
a recommendation letter

263
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,872
from a famous master carpenter
from the Land of Sand.

264
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,336
As you may already know,

265
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,473
there's a bit of a construction boom
in Leaf Village.

266
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:15,016
Every place is in need of more people.

267
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:17,616
And we needed more hands ourselves,

268
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,246
so we decided to hire him right away.

269
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,849
His carpeting skills...
were all right, just average.

270
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:26,222
I didn't feel the urge to
hire him permanently,

271
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,356
nor did I feel like I wanted to
fire him right away.

272
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,366
He took his job seriously.

273
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:34,966
He was perfect to hire
when we were short on people.

274
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,302
But after a while,

275
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:42,369
I found out that the recommendation letter
he brought was a fake.

276
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:45,340
This is the recommendation letter
he brought.

277
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:50,252
And how is this a fake?

278
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:54,783
There was a guy who brought
a recommendation letter

279
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,327
from the same master carpenter
more than ten years ago.

280
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:00,889
I just happen to find that
recommendation letter,

281
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:04,025
so I compared it and I noticed
that the handwriting was different...

282
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:06,634
And that recommendation letter?

283
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:08,965
It's over there in that cabinet...

284
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,579
Oh? Where did I put it?
I know I put it here...

285
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,472
It's okay if you don't have it.

286
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,217
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:26,414
For us, we really didn't care if
his recommendation letter was a fake

288
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:29,824
as long as he didn't do anything bad.

289
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:35,195
I just thought that I should let things
like this be known to Lady Tsunade...

290
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,160
I didn't think that
the old man was

291
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:42,695
a Shinobi from another country
and that he would steal our plans...

292
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:46,902
I still can't believe it.

293
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:51,107
Hey, is it really that
old man's doing?

294
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,984
I can't believe it either.

295
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:01,247
There're no signs of traps...

296
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:08,432
All right.

297
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,595
This is where the old man lived, huh?

298
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:17,698
He always paid the rent on time.

299
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,536
He really was quite proper...

300
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:25,610
Once in a while he'd come home
after drinking with his carpenter friends,

301
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:28,174
but he would never cause trouble.

302
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:33,246
Well, I did predict it,
but there are no clues...

303
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:34,525
I found it!

304
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:35,759
What did you find?

305
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:40,964
A special bonito broth, refreshing udon
and light broth super thin udon!

306
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,930
We're not looking for food!

307
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,266
But usually if somebody
is living by himself,

308
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,670
he'd probably stack up
on a bit more food...

309
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:51,574
There's only instant cup udon.

310
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:57,413
Didn't he eat out a lot?
I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot...

311
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,073
Right, Naruto?

312
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,673
Oh... Yeah.

313
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:04,615
If he cooked himself, he could have
eaten more and saved money...

314
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,019
Choji, we're not talking about you.

315
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:21,929
That old man
barely talked about himself...

316
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,534
Just as I expected.

317
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,206
Oh, but he did happily talk about

318
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:30,304
how he became friends
with one of the kids in the village.

319
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:34,317
He might have heard something
from the old man.

320
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,181
Oh, I wonder about that.

321
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:39,011
What you mean you wonder about that?

322
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,384
We won't know until we find the kid
and question him, won't we?

323
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:46,729
But it seems like there's no need for us
to look for him or question him.

324
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:50,032
What?! Then, where is this guy!

325
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:54,303
Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!

326
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,037
What?! Me?!

327
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,203
Yeah, there's no mistake about that.

328
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:00,903
You're Naruto Uzumaki?

329
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:02,379
Huh?

330
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:07,007
We want you to
talk with us for a bit.

331
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,818
<i>On a checkerboard night</i>

332
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,322
<i>when the stardust's are rapidly dancing</i>

333
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,827
<i>I just can't come out and say,</i>
<i>"Ah, I don't want to go home yet."</i>

334
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:53,957
<i>Suggestively</i>

335
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:58,764
<i>Spat at that beloved face!!</i>
<i>Mister Cricket</i>

336
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:05,375
<i>The Trombone gradually going off key</i>

337
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:11,939
<i>While on the sweaty center stage</i>
<i>does bug me.</i>

338
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:16,976
<i>But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel</i>
<i>in my undeveloped chest,</i>

339
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:22,151
<i>I wonder if it's from</i>
<i>that coke I just drank?</i>

340
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,922
I wonder what kind of interrogation
Naruto is undergoing?

341
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,492
I guess they would use
Regressive Hypnosis or something.

342
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,787
What's Regressive Hypnosis?

343
00:22:57,895 --> 00:23:00,625
It's a Jutsu to draw out
subconscious memories.

344
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:05,393
Then Naruto might know something
