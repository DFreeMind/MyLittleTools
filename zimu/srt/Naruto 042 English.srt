It arrives you to this point…

18
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,690
… I do not have neanche to fight
with you for Sasuke-kun!

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,990
Sakura! You know with who you are speaking?

20
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,330
Sakura, child piagnona!

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,170
It seems… Seems
Task that Sakura-chan has exaggerated.

22
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,040
The look of Ino puts fear.

23
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,250
Not creed…

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,920
Sakura is not type to boast itself of its force
and to hurt someone without reason.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,090
It does not want that Ino is indulgente.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,320
Well…

27
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,200
… We use fully…

28
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,080
… our force and we fight…

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,170
… loyal!

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,790
The best battle
it is ok, eternal damnation!!

31
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,280
E' only the Bunshin not Jutsu.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,030
We are not to the final examination of the academy!

33
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,070
Creeds to strike to me with techniques
cos ì  elementary?

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,540
If I make attention I can easy
to characterize that true one.

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,300
I accumulate of blow the Chakra to the feet…

36
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,510
… and I hit the pavement!

37
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,250
That speed!

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,930
You of it you will repent if it continues
to consider me Sakura the piagnona.

39
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,930
You fight seriously, Ino!

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,560
They are content to feel to you to say it.

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,600
As you want,  I will fight  seriously.

42
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,750
Cos ì  is made, Sakura-chan!

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,780
Good!

44
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,580
Truly good!

45
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,250
Better E' of the other esordienti
in the movements that demand the Chakra.

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,420
Sakura is a guerriero suit.

47
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,510
Better also than me?

48
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,960
Eh, s ì!

49
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,100
In making circular the chakra in all
the body and to use it at the opportune moment…

50
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,430
… he is advanced even to Sasuke.

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,160
Sakura always has been the best one
in the control of the Chakra.

52
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,570
Sakura-saint wonderful movement!

53
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,490
But also your adversary is strong.

54
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,360
E' a battle at par.
It will be a long combat!

55
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,350
Quand' is that he has become cos ì  strong?

56
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,020
I can win… I can…!

57
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,520
Why you…

58
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,280
If they continue cos ì  never not finiranno.

59
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,870
It is made long.

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,960
They will be already passes 10 minuteren to you.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,140
You will not be never strongly how much me!

62
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,240
A person who loses cos ì  much time
in the cure of hats it will not be never my par.

63
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,120
For this you they are advanced!

64
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,500
You are making a large one
error in underrating me!

65
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,420
Stupid, takes the insults too much seriously.

66
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,540
Goodness knows that he arranges now.

67
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,120
He does not appeal to to me when Ino makes cos ì.

68
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,220
Poor fool.

69
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,650
Cabbage, completely has gone.

70
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,280
IT WATCHES!!

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,650
It pecks this to you!

72
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,860
Fa..Fa fear.>.

73
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,380
Hour  I will conclude  the encounter.

74
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,370
I will make  to declare  you endured the sconfittà.

75
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,350
What, she is for…

76
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,250
It is…

77
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Those I seal…!

78
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,610
As I thought wants to use
the Shintenshin not Jutsu.

79
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,350
Accidents, than foolish!

80
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,070
I understand that you are in
difficulty but is useless.

81
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Beh, we will see it.

82
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,030
Ninpo: Shintenshin not Jutsu…

83
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,160
Who uses it, rilascia the mental energy…

84
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,150
… taking the control of the adversary…

85
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,050
… he is of the mind that of the body…

86
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,970
… for some minuteren.

87
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,590
But this technique has a point weak person:

88
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,660
The rilasciata mental energy…

89
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,840
… one moves slowly
and only online straight.

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,210
Moreover…

91
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,480
… in the case in which the rilasciata energy
it does not have to hit the adversary…

92
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,990
… it will return behind only after some minuteren.

93
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,030
Therefore during that period…

94
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:08,910
… your body will be found in condition
of absolute vulnerability.

95
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,710
The Shintenshin Jutsu is not adapted
in the espionage and not to the combat.

96
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,050
Ino, to use that tacnica
it is equivalent to the suicide.

97
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,850
If continuous Sakura to move
it will not run dangers.

98
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,760
If schiverà the Jutsu will be able
to make those that it wants of Ino.

99
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,930
In that Hayate case
it will have to suspend the encounter.

100
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,810
And then!

101
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,190
We will only know after that  I will have tried  to us!

102
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,070
Sai that for you it will be the end if mistakes?

103
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,810
In combat…

104
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,430
… it is a Jutsu to use after to have immobilized
the adversary with my Kagemane not Jutsu.

105
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,760
But to use it now is absurd.

106
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
It will not hit it.

107
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,270
Stupid, not to make it!

108
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,930
Ninpo:Shintenshin not Jutsu!

109
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,400
In which of the two it is?

110
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,370
Sin…

111
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,000
… Ino.

112
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Now not there is nothing that can make.

113
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,630
It has made large.

114
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,260
Then I have won.

115
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,970
What…!

116
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,230
Six fall in my trap, Sakura.

117
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,610
To the fine ones I have taken to you.

118
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,070
You have.>.?

119
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,790
Exactly.

120
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,830
Those seal were only one feint.

121
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,590
They served to push to you in this trap.

122
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,510
You do not succeed to move to you, true?

123
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,420
E' one special rope, created making to slide
my Chakra through hats.

124
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,890
The encounter will end as soon as  I will be  within
of you and  I will say  "I surrender ".

125
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,440
This time  I will not mistake!

126
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,810
I understand.

127
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,740
That stupid pretended itself svenuta.

128
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,280
You run, Sakura-chan!

129
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,790
I cannot move!

130
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,610
Hour… Shintenshin not Jutsu!

131
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,850
Sin…

132
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
It has lacked.

133
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,780
Not.

134
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,950
Sakura-saint.

135
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,980
Sakura-chan.

136
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,400
… Sakura.

137
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,350
What has happened to Ino?

138
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,720
And… Also Sakura-chan is strange!

139
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,820
It is  my occasion.

140
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,890
You strike It, Sakura-chan!

141
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,740
It cannot.

142
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,820
The Shintenshin Jutsu is not conceived
for these cases, but it has worked.

143
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,450
Shintenshin?

144
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,950
It means that Sakura-saint it is.>.?

145
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,710
S ì,  Ino has been impossessata of the mind of Sakura.

146
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,840
Within Sakura in this moment there is Ino.

147
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,050
Probably hour Ino…

148
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,050
Ended E'.

149
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,260
Hello Hello, Sakura.

150
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,460
I, Haruno sakura, me…

151
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,290
… arren…

152
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,000
Nooo!!!!

153
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,800
Pff… noisy E' cos  ì.

154
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,340
You six engaged a lot in order to arrive end here!

155
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,050
It will be a shame if you will lose against
that only obsessed matta from Sasuke!

156
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,970
Useless E' that you say "me ".

157
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,510
What…

158
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
This cold…

159
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,650
Naruto makes always this casino.

160
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,880
Sakura!

161
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
E' a idiocy…

162
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,500
What is?

163
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,130
You surrender?

164
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,190
Not me arrendero' never!

165
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,890
Eternal damnation!

166
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,520
But who is…

167
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,990
What…

168
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,560
Sakura…

169
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,940
It is not possible.

170
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,250
The technique has failed?

171
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:26,370
Ino! If you do not exit endured from my body,
you will taste hell!

172
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,750
What happens to Ino?

173
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,100
Not…!

174
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,970
I will not resist  to along in this state!

175
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,340
Issolution!

176
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,800
Incredible!

177
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,420
Succeeded E' to contrast the technique of Ino!

178
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,250
It has wasted too many energies
before using the technique.

179
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,580
Cos ì  has found not possession
Sufficient Chakra.

180
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,410
You have two personality?

181
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,630
Com' is possible?

182
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,070
I have an equal force to my beauty.

183
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,440
The girls must be
strong in order to survive.

184
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,400
She does not escape herself easy cos  ì
to that technique.

185
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,440
True E' that Ino had Chakra little…

186
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,270
… but the combative spirit of Sakura…

187
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,450
… in the comparisons of Ino avails again…

188
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,530
… it has had a fundamental role.

189
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,770
This last one has been risvegliato
from the words of Naruto…

190
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,790
… driving away Ino.

191
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,660
It is not one surprised that Sakura…

192
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,640
… like Naruto…

193
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,520
… sopporta to lose.

194
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,520
But…

195
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,020
… both short of Chakra are.

196
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,630
This will be…

197
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,040
… the last attack.

198
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,260
Both are disabled to continue.

199
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,440
For the double KO, nobody it exceeds
4° the eliminatorio encounter.

200
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,700
To the next one then.

201
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,740
Boys.

202
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,420
Ehi Ino!

203
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,330
Sakura-saint!

204
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,910
Sakura-chan!

205
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,000
Goes all good?

206
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,190
They do not have need not even of medical cures.

207
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,640
They will be waked up between a po '.

208
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,150
However they are been strange.

209
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,240
I knew that Naruto and Sasuke
they were becomes to you more forts…

210
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,640
… but from Sakura not me
never I would be waited for.

211
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,980
It has not been easy, but they are content
to have them candidates to this examination…

212
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,300
… of selection of the Chunin.

213
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,840
Tenten
VS
Temari

214
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,140
I feel to explode from when
I have seen that encounter.

215
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,280
Also it comes from the Country of the Sand.

216
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,200
You make of your better Tenten!

217
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,780
It will be an interesting combat.

218
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,370
Finally six alarm clock, Sakura.

219
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,050
Tenten! USA all your force!

220
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,180
Vai! Not there is limit in your life!

221
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,130
Our crash is ended.

222
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,350
I have… I have lost?

223
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,660
Me vien it wants to cry…

224
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,440
… to think that I have pareggiato
against like you.

225
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,660
You hold!

226
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,330
Six become…

227
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,320
… a beautifulst flower.

228
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,980
But…

229
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,600
The next time that we will fight
from there you will not exit with one faint.

230
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:33,070
Moreover know that I do not have intention
to leave Sasuke-kun you.

231
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,200
The same one is worth for me!

232
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,580
