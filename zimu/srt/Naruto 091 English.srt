Impossible…

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,030
I would not have never thought that he could use the technique of the Quarter.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,580
However, it is not successful anchor to learn it.

38
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,540
This technique is an imitation.

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,670
Tsunade has still that monstrous force.

40
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,300
Me memory still the time in which it had launch to me to a hundred of meters with a fist.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,550
But, the technique of Naruto was not enough strong.

42
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,600
Tutto OK?

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,600
Jiraya! six you that you have taught the Rasengan to it?

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,690
Rasengan?

45
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,950
After all, they are teaching its.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,360
Only You and the Quarter can use this technique.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,660
Insegnargli one technical that will not be in degree to learn. You chiamaresti teaching itself?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,500
You are joking.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Here because this child says sciochezze on as he she wants to become Hokage.

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,550
They are not sciochezze.

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,470
Idiot! you a six idiot!

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,550
I can dominate this tecnina in three days!

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,850
You say, child.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,270
A man must respect the given word.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,980
I will respect  the given word.

56
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
This is my creed ninja.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,610
Well, then we make a bet.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,450
A bet?

59
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,490
I will give  one  week to you.

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,870
If you succeed to dominate this technique, I  will recognize  that you can become Hokage…

61
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,500
And I will give  this  necklace to you.

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,710
Tsunade-sama! that one is important…

63
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,970
That necklace does not serve me worthless.

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,590
Not to say cos ì,  Naruto.>.

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,510
That one is an only necklace that could buy approximately three mountains if you would sell it.

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
It belonged to Primo Hokage.

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,810
Wow…

68
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,110
Task that  I will accept.

69
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,440
I can say that piacciono the moneies…

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,200
OK, but if you do not succeed to dominate to the technique in one week…

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,950
You lose. And I  will take  to all your moneies.

72
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,960
Ah! Gama-chan! When you have it…

73
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,710
Tsunade-sama, because? This necklace is…

74
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,960
Like if it could make it us. We go via, Shizune.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,760
It has not never bet that necklace…

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,640
If I do not have one endured answer, not ago nothing.

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,100
But it would appeal to to us to have it within one week.

78
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,950
Episode #91
The inheritance of Primo Hokage
The necklace that calls the dead women

79
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,830
Who is to this hour of night?

80
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,960
OK, OK, arrival.

81
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,340
Scusami if you disturbance to this hour. Naruto-kun, I must speak to you.

82
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,180
I want to remain calm this evening, I must train to me tomorrow.

83
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,010
Me dispiace, but I do not want that there is a misunderstanding with Tsunade-sama.

84
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,770
And also.... He has purpose of that necklace!

85
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,150
That old one, has given to me of the crazy one.

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,650
Tsunade-sama is not the person kind who creeds!

87
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,730
Not to speak like if you knew all of she!

88
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,160
Scusami if I have screaied…

89
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,540
Before, it was not cos ì.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,170
It was a great person who loved its village.

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,300
But then  she changed…

92
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,890
from that day.

93
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,600
That day?

94
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,350
What happened that day?

95
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,900
It is  the day where it has lost
The Dream, the Love, and the Hope.

96
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,110
The only thing that remains it of its past, is that necklace

97
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,370
For Tsunade-sama, this necklace is more important of its life.

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,870
It is not qualche.cosa that  can  be bet cos ì.

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,790
I do not know what dirti.

100
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,800
Who  is she has defied to me.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,760
That one not one normal necklace that a person as you it would have to carry.

102
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,480
If someone beyond to Tsunade-sama tries to carry it…

103
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,270
This person will be condemned…

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,520
To die.

105
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,670
Nawaki, congratulations for yours twelfth birthday.

106
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,310

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,980
Soon, you open your gift. They are sure that it will appeal to to you, Nawaki.

109
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,240

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,970
P roteggerò  not only this necklace…

116
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,180
but also this village that is the treasure of the grandfather.

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,350
I must proteggerlo.

118
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,560
Nawaki…

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,770
I am the grandson of the first Hokage that has founded the village of Konoha.

120
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,730
You feel it!

121
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,780
A man must respect the given word…

122
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,030
S ì,  I want to become like my grandfather, and a day  I will receive  the title it of Hokage!

123
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,250
Why to become Hokage is my dream.

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,630
You remove the coprifronte, Nawaki.>.

125
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,130
you move, you remove it. I have an other gift.

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,140
E' a portafortuna in order to realize your dreams.

127
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,500
E' better than does not watch the body.

128
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,420
It leaves it. Even if it watches will not be able to recognize its brother.

129
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,920
Enough, Orochimaru!

130
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,720
After all, we are in war hour....

131
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,560
All the Ninja make the same end… not are doctors on the battlefields.

132
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,230
But the children are too much unconscious.

133
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,190
Especially the day after that they have received a gift.

134
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,710
Proteggerò  not only this necklace…

135
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,460
but also this village that is the treasure of the grandfather.

136
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,260
I must proteggerlo!

137
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,550
Then, in order to facilitate the happened one of the mission,

138
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,430
The small squares of four will have to strike themselves in enemy territory.

139
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,980
If a specialist doctor is assigned to the square,

140
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,110
The rate resolution and the probability of survival will increase…

141
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,570
Consequently, task that now, the more important task…

142
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,740
It is  to carry of the Ninja medical to a high level…

143
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,450
and to promote the development of medical techniques.

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,830
That  that you have said is right, but currently we are in war.

145
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,340
To train these specialist doctors will make us to lose the time, and for more it is not much realistic one.

146
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,550
The enemy will not be to wait for to us.

147
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,430
What says, old matto!?

148
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,020
In this case, it does not import the time that we will employ ourselves…

149
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,480
I am of I come to an agreement with she.

150
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,440
We do not want to waste the life of the Ninja, than they are sacrifices to you.

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,480
We would have to act already from now,

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,570
Scusami…

153
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,820
Thanks in order before.

154
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,950
What you said was right.

155
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,870
Um....

156
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,500
E' late. You want that it accompanies to you?

157
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,840
How? If it does not disturb to you? Where dresses?

158
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,130
From the other part of the city.

159
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,720
It leaves to lose.

160
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,260
Not preoccuparti. I want to speak with you.

161
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,850
I often passed from this road in order to go to take my sister to the academy.

162
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,060
He passes to you?

163
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,070
Oh, she is died a fà year when Konoha was attacked.

164
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,070
It is like me…

165
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,930
Tomorrow, our mission will carry to us close to opposing front line.

166
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,180
To fight makes us to only lose the persons to we more beloveds.

167
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,110
It is not the job of a Ninja.

168
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,990
Because we live in a world of Ninja, where the dead women attend to us…

169
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,860
I want to sacrifice itself in order to make that all she ends.
I love this village and all people.

170
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,370
Here because I want proteggerli.

171
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,330
When my sister mor ì,  that feeling has helped me.

172
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,080
This is because I want to become Hokage.

173
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
For the emergency of all.

174
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,880
To become Hokage is my dream.

175
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,180
Dan…

176
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,530
I want that… You chip axes this.

177
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,620
You resume yourself, Dan!

178
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,040
Tsunade, I do not want to die…

179
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,170
I have still many things to make…

180
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,630
Not to speak, Dan!

181
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,470
Its broken kidney and…

182
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Also Tsunade, a Sannin,  cannot  make it us…

183
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,140
I cannot die here…

184
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,600
He will not happen. I have stopped the hemorrhage.

185
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,020
All good will go!

186
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,820
Tutto OK, hour. Soon you will be well, Dan!

187
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,740
I see…

188
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,280
They are content…

189
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,490
Dan! You resume yourself, Dan!

190
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,790
Eternal damnation, stopped!!

191
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,460
Stopped! Stopped!

192
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:10,180
stopped, Stopped, Stopped, Stopped…

193
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,930
Stopped! By now it is died.

194
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,460
You have understood, hour, Naruto-kun?

195
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,050
After that day, Tsunade-sama has not been never more the same one.

196
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Naruto-kun?

197
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,360
I go to train to me.

198
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,470
Oh, you are drinking!

199
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,640
Welcome!

200
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,680
What makes us here?

201
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,180
Not to say cos ì,  six cos ì  cold.

202
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,730
Jiraiya-sama…

203
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,400
Shizune, scusami, but you can leave us alone?

204
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,650
E' from much time that I do not drink with she.

205
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,200
Getlteman, of the sakè! And also of the ravanelli.

206
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,070
S ì,  endured!

207
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,540
Please cure of she is taken, Jiraiya-sama.

208
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,840
There are the ravanelli.

209
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Oh, seems good.

210
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,640
I did not think that you would have guarded cos ì  preciously this necklace.

211
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,730
I was convinced that you had lost it in some bet.

212
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
This is a memory, just?

213
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,570
It annoys to you?

214
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,030
Which thing?

215
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,700
Naruto.

216
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,120
Not of all.

217
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,250
But a six too much hard adult.

218
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,710
In a week, it is practically impossible to dominate that technique.

219
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,840
I would not call it a bet.

220
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,850
Why six frustrated?

221
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,270
I am not frustrated.

222
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,100
You have met true Orochimaru?

223
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,440
It can  be seen from the face of Shizune.

224
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,700
But I do not know that type of proposal has made you.

225
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,370
Not to take one hurried decision.

226
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,700
And then, what is one that I must dirti.

227
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,420
Old the proteggevano Hokage Konoha and the life of the persons…

228
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,920
In order to guard the things and the village com' they were. This was their dream.

229
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,630
Poor their life in game for this dream.

230
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,060
With this I do not want to say that you did not comprise old the Hokage.

231
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,650
But know that if you betray the village of Konoha,

232
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,400
Then, in that moment.... I will kill  to you!

233
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,700
It does not interest to me.

234
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,040
Only the murders do not feel nothing when their neighbors die.

235
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,710
Six various one.

236
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,050
Nobody has taken cure of the village like has made you.

237
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,170
Also this time.>.

238
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,130
You stop makes me foretells!

239
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,220
Because…

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,850
You have carried this child here?

241
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,930
To become Hokage is my dream.

242
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,820
The somiglia it is not true? It has more or less the same age.

243
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,440
And with this.

244
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,830
To become Hokage is my dream.

245
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,330
You stà exiting too much blood… You want to perhaps die?

246
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,550
Nawaki, you a six Genin, therefore if six on a battlefield, you must escape.

247
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,050
A man  cannot  escape!!

248
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,510
This dream, and this enthusiasm, also…

249
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,980
I do not succeed to make it us…

250
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,240
Merda,  I will recommence  tomorrow…

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,280
That badly of head.

252
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,710
To cause its, I have passed one ugly night.

253
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,290
Naruto…

254
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,340
One would say that it is not returned to house yesterday.

255
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,730
It can  be that.... Imprudent.

256
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,910
Which thing you would say of an agreement?

257
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,960
I can resuscitare your brother and your fiancèe…

258
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,000
Thanks to one technical prohibited that I have developed.

259
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,720
You would not want to see them of new, Tsunade?

260
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,930
If I recover your arms,

261
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,730
Which thing you count to make?

262
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,980
This time,  I will end  what I have begun, the destruction of Konoha!

263
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,360
It does not listen to you!

264
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,990
Their dreams.... And your dreams…

265
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,570
You have forgotten your dreams?

266
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,280
I must dirti one what, Tsunade.

267
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,120
Tsunade, the High Council has to you chosen for being the Fifth Hokage.

268
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,800
The Believe your promised, it' s too hard to give me courage…

269
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,420
Allways, the feel it. The precious Time with you…
