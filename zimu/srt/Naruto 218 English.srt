1
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,097
To think the Leaf's reinforcements
will be you of all people!

2
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:17,207
A man should always repay
the debt he owes a woman.

3
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:21,370
Always the bothersome guy with
the man and woman stuff!

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:26,212
Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after
the guys who took our village g irl.

5
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,352
Forget about here and
head for them!

6
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:30,349
We've received information.

7
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,726
Gaara and Kankuro have entered
their respective battles.

8
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:35,759
I see...

9
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,259
<i>The shadow won't reach, I guess...</i>

10
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:44,030
Leaf Village's two man cells are
just now heading there for back up.

11
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,134
How well prepared.

12
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,003
It's a pain,

13
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:50,873
but as long as we're doing this,
we'll do it right.

14
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:54,078
We'll do it perfectly without
producing casualties!

15
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:58,446
Make sure you don't cry
in front of me this time.

16
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:02,217
Are you going to hold
that over my head forever?

17
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:04,281
Just like a woman...

18
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:09,325
<i>I I feel like I don't really</i>
<i>have my place in this.</i>

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,362
I'll take care of all of you at once!

20
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:15,829
Here it comes!

21
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:30,014
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,767
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

23
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:55,639
<i>because we were always together</i>

24
00:01:56,176 --> 00:02:01,739
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

25
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:07,344
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

26
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:14,026
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

27
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

28
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:33,639
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

29
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:40,049
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

30
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,251
<i>Our two hearts</i>

31
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:03,235
<i>Sealed Sand. The Counterattack!</i>

32
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,169
To think you'd ask
the Leaf Village for help...

33
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:09,944
I guess the Sand has lost the edge
they used to have, huh?

34
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:11,541
Why are you here?

35
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,248
You know, dogs.

36
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:21,359
They're not satisfied until a favor
has been properly returned.

37
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,425
Especially this Akamaru!

38
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,929
A dog retuning a favor doesn't
have much of a ring to it!

39
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:32,398
Help is on the way to
the other two as well.

40
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:35,066
You concentrate on this fight!

41
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,942
You're giving me lip!

42
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:40,710
So you flies are gonna gang up
on me, huh?

43
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,548
But you're no match for my Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

44
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:45,681
Eat this!

45
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:01,063
If your Chakra isn't built up,
your sand is no big deal at all!

46
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,335
It'll only be useful for
blinding me at best!

47
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:06,670
It's futile!

48
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,706
I feel it.
Your Chakra is being sucked up.

49
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,983
What?! He was setting the sand
in the gourd aside?!

50
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,764
<i>I was being cautious,</i>
<i>but he is much too strong.</i>

51
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,548
<i>Gaara Sensei!</i>

52
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,573
Just what I'd expect from
Gaara of the Sand.

53
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,943
He's not called the ultimate weapon
for nothing...

54
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,679
The ultimate... weapon?!

55
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,817
However, he cannot exceed
our Ninja tools

56
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,325
forged in the Village of the Artisans!

57
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:14,734
Gaara!

58
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,702
Hey, he's totally got the edge!

59
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,440
Do we have a chance to
return the favor?

60
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,180
That's incredible wind.
What an amount of Chakra...

61
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:36,889
No, it seems that sword is
amplifying her Chakra.

62
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,484
So she's relying on that sword for
all of her attack and defense, huh?

63
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,228
Anyway, we've got to slip within
firing range for our Jutsu

64
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,199
and stop her movements!

65
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:49,193
Right.

66
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,261
Let's go at once!

67
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,506
Annoying!

68
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,282
<i>She's attempting to maintain</i>
<i>her distance just from Temari.</i>

69
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:16,727
<i>I see.</i>

70
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:19,461
<i>So she just wants to pay attention</i>
<i>to the long range type Temari and</i>

71
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:22,559
<i>blow us mid range Jutsu users</i>
<i>away with wind</i>

72
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:24,467
<i>before we can get close, huh...?</i>

73
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:26,803
<i>Now then, what should we do?</i>

74
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:30,466
Man Beast Clone!

75
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,339
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

76
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:34,909
Crow!

77
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,240
- Arms!
- Fang Over Fang!

78
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,187
Did you guys come to
get in my way?!

79
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:47,621
We made sure to send you
a signal, right?!

80
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:49,427
How could I tell?!

81
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:51,854
We don't click at all?

82
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,926
Are you guys... messing around?!

83
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,003
Be more serious and die!

84
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:59,403
Talking nonsense!

85
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:35,906
<i>Although I reduced the damage</i>
<i>with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still...</i>

86
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,850
Just what I'd expect of Gaara,

87
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:47,944
the Sand's ultimate w eapon
who hosts the Shukaku...

88
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,523
But you're already in our hands.

89
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,268
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>She's beyond the range of my Jutsu...</i>

90
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:16,508
<i>and I don't see anything around here</i>
<i>that could be used to extend my shadow.</i>

91
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:22,850
Hey!

92
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,296
What're you whispering about?

93
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,896
What're you thinking?!

94
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,897
I'll explain later, for crying out loud.
Can you do it or not?

95
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,067
I suppose I could try, but...

96
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,408
What is it...?

97
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:58,152
What's he doing?

98
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,937
Behold the terror of Ninja tools
our village created.

99
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,561
<i>What's this Chakra?</i>

100
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,644
<i>This is a water vein!</i>

101
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,782
<i>I get it!</i>

102
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,621
<i>The lines connecting the point</i>
<i>in the center and triangle isn't a Barrier...</i>

103
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:09,920
<i>It's a water vein!</i>

104
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,089
Ninja Tool Barrier:
Reverse Scale Formation... Activate!

105
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,354
Oh no!

106
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,123
Gaara Sensei!

107
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,761
The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation
was a single point, Gaara from the start!

108
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,100
Our swords accurately pierce
a water vein

109
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,933
and summon the water dragon.

110
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,439
Sand has sucked up
a large amount of water

111
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,974
and has become as heavy as lead...

112
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,773
Now Gaara can no longer use sand.

113
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:01,906
Gaara!

114
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:03,915
- Gaara!
- Calm down!

115
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,978
Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!

116
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,184
That guy is?!

117
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:11,852
They'll save Gaara,
no matter what.

118
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,620
We need to concentrate on
the enemy in front of us.

119
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,135
To think you'd choose
a sandy area to fall on...

120
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,475
Just what I'd expect of Gaara
of the desert...

121
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:33,976
However!

122
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,251
That's as far as
your useless resistance goes!

123
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,089
Leaf Hurricane!

124
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,295
A hero's turn always comes late!

125
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,693
That's right!

126
00:12:58,805 --> 00:12:59,999
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!

127
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:01,569
Naruto!

128
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,676
It seems you rushed to everyone
during the Sasuke incident...

129
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,774
This time we've come to return
the favor from that time.

130
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,749
So we'll take that guy on!

131
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:15,253
You hurry to your student straight on!

132
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,226
To think he'd corner you this far...

133
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:25,889
- Lee!
- Sakura!

134
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:31,033
Leave Gaara's treatment to me!
Lee, you go with Naruto!

135
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:33,231
- Sakura!
- Got it!

136
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:38,905
Then I'll be going first!

137
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,475
Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!

138
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,113
I'll suck up all of your Chakra!

139
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:56,192
I see. So this means we can't
release our regular power?

140
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:57,893
That doesn't matter!

141
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,662
Even without Chakra,
we've got fighting spirit!

142
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:05,494
Yes! We'll go with that
plus willpower!

143
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,640
Just as I thought.

144
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:18,342
That they haven't launched anything
during the fight thus far means

145
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:21,114
the two reinforcements don't
have long range type Jutsu.

146
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:23,853
Then I'll maintain this distance and...

147
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,517
you'll die getting torn up by the wind!

148
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,494
<i>While she's distracted by Shikamaru</i>
<i>and the others,</i>

149
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,588
<i>I'll just go for it!</i>

150
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:34,863
Mind Destruction...!

151
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,764
Ino!

152
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:41,999
Foolish girl. It's useless to attempt
to exploit an opening!

153
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:43,105
You little!

154
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:53,542
You won't get close to me!
I've read your range as well!

155
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,853
I don't know about that...!

156
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,419
Ino! You stay right there!

157
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,024
<i>I'm counting on you...!</i>

158
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:05,894
Shino! Sakura!

159
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,763
There's one wounded
at the waterfall.

160
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,165
Tunneling Fang!

161
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:18,207
Now!

162
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,073
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

163
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,110
Oh...!

164
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:24,476
What're you doing?!

165
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,948
Are you guys... mocking me?

166
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:32,521
<i>After sucking up all of your Chakra,</i>
<i>I'll be returning the favor plenty!</i>

167
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,490
<i>The contusion treatment is complete.</i>

168
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:41,925
<i>But, the depletion of Chakra</i>
<i>is overwhelming.</i>

169
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,165
Contact from your friends...?

170
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,338
- Ino's hurt?!
- Go!

171
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,608
Wha?! But in your condition...

172
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,915
I'm okay now. Help your friend!

173
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,178
Okay. Don't push yourself.

174
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:04,180
Yeah...

175
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:13,257
What're you doing?!
Hurry up and go after your comrade!

176
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,290
I'll help my comrade.

177
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:17,795
I'll settle this in a moment.

178
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,700
But...

179
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:21,401
Bushy Brow!

180
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,977
<i>Damn it. It's no good</i>
<i>just shot gunning it!</i>

181
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,074
<i>It's just him?</i>

182
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>A part of Black Ant...</i>

183
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:43,521
<i>Could it be...a signal?</i>

184
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:45,821
Fang Over Fang once more!

185
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,526
Back me up with Crow!

186
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,364
I'm counting on you
for back up too, Choji!

187
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:52,602
Got it!

188
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,068
<i>Heh! Bossing me around.</i>

189
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,013
The counterattack starts now!

190
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,549
It's futile. Your Jutsu won't reach me!

191
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:10,785
You never know until you try, right...?!

192
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:12,186
Here we go!

193
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,460
Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!

194
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:16,557
Huh?!

195
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:21,327
What're you aiming at?!
Totally misguided...

196
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:23,993
<i>Say what?</i>

197
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:25,964
What's the meaning of this?

198
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,336
I'm sure I'd read your range already...!

199
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,769
I'll show you!

200
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:37,807
I can create a shadow with
this thick a current

201
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:39,010
even if the water's clear.

202
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:44,813
My Jutsu's range has infinitely
improved by lifting the waterfall!

203
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,719
The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success!

204
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,619
Summoning...

205
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,357
Blade Dance!

206
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,114
This one's done!

207
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,519
<i>Good grief...</i>

208
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,316
<i>I...couldn't do anything.</i>

209
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,194
<i>Here everyone's doing their best...</i>

210
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,162
<i>Only I...</i>

211
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:28,493
Ino?

212
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:31,262
Gaara.

213
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:39,402
You don't have any sand
left you can use.

214
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,545
What's this?!

215
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,140
He smashed the Sand Armor.

216
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:50,282
No way! But the sand
heavy with water like that...

217
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,523
If I just suck up the Chakra...

218
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:56,991
This is my weapon!

219
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,907
You okay, Gaara?!

220
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,009
This is the finishing blow...

221
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,608
Gaara Sensei!

222
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,418
Hurry! Leave the rest to us!

223
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,719
Man Beast Clone!

224
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:27,955
Fang Over Fang!

225
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:29,654
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

226
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:33,865
Annoying buzzing flies!

227
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,163
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!

228
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:44,936
What?!

229
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:46,575
Oh, no!

230
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:50,979
Puppet Show...

231
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,881
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

232
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,064
The show's over!

233
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:09,601
- We did it!
- Yeah!

234
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:15,570
<i>Matsuri.</i>

235
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,336
<i>Gaara and...!</i>

236
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:24,743
<i>A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.</i>

237
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,182
<i>He's heading for the valley.</i>

238
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:29,546
The last one...

239
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,882
Gaara is chasing him!

240
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:32,786
What?!

241
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,398
You okay, Bushy Brow?
Sakura will be right back.

242
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,596
Thanks.

243
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,693
Well, I'm going after Gaara!

244
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,534
Got it! I'll meet up with you later!

245
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:58,544
<i>I've got him cornered.</i>

246
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:13,863
<i>Matsuri.</i>

247
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,405
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

248
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:29,745
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

249
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:39,555
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

250
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:44,153
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

251
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

252
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:53,969
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

253
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,943
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

254
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:03,175
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

255
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:07,652
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

256
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,058
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

257
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,961
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

258
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:24,230
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

259
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:28,364
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

260
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:33,242
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

261
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:37,939
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

262
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:44,081
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

263
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:52,726
I heard you figured out the identities
of the Four Celestials?

264
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:55,766
Yes. They are the Ninja of
the Village of the Artisans

265
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:57,393
who've been harboring ill feeling
toward the Five Great Nations.

266
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,395
It seems they've completed
the forbidden project

267
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,099
passed down in the village and

268
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,970
intend to resurrect
their ultimate weapon.

269
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:07,168
I see. I take it the other villagers
got wind of it and evacuated.

270
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:10,180
Exactly. You head over to
where they are immediately.

271
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:10,840
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,979
Next time:
"The Ultimate Weapon Reborn"
