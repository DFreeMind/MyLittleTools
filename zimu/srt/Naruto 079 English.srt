2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,510
As a start, rough up the medium kid to wake him up.

3
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,170
Then the jutsu will end.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,560
How're we gonna wake him up?

5
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,610
Just give one blow to that kid.

6
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,890
But, I'm not good at Henge.

7
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,770
What?

8
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,170
So, you become my will and do the hand seal.

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,410
It's a Combination Henge.

10
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,780
One with fangs and nails, you got it?

11
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,130
Let's go!

12
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,690
Henge!

13
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,740
Exceeding the Limit!
~ Light and Shadow ~

14
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,480
A fox?

15
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,400
Here!

16
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,440
What kind of battle are they doing!

17
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,310
I can't say I'm safe here either.

18
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,780
Shit.

19
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,310
His power is getting stronger.

20
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,970
Oyabin! We got to wake him up soon!

21
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,500
I know that!

22
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,460
Let's do this!

23
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,950
Die!

24
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,520
Here I come!

25
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,220
Alright! Now!

26
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,300
Wake the fuck up!

27
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,130
Bastard!

28
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Good. It hasn't been long since
the medium kid went into sleep.

29
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,030
In his current condition, that one blow is enough.

30
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,250
God Damn it! I just came out!

31
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,020
His Jutsu was disengaged?

32
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,030
I'm still being pushed even after
releasing the Tanuki Neiri. (Fake Sleep)

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,730
He released my Jutsu?

34
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,940
Sabaku Kyu (Sand Coffin)

35
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,190
Dad!

36
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,600
Yup!

37
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,860
This is the tongue of Oyabin!

38
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,930
Don't mess with me!

39
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,080
How much power does this guy have?

40
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,110
This isn't good. Both Naruto and I have
already used up our chakra completely.

41
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,690
You are going to be killed by me.

42
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,180
My existence won't be erased!

43
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,340
Konoha Senpu!

44
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,490
Not only the Sound, but this many Jounin
of the Sand came... Who'd imagine this?

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, logically that isn't out of the ordinary...

46
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,830
This is a war.

47
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,250
This is long.

48
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,000
It's very rare that a shinobi keeps battling
against a shinobi for this extended period.

49
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,780
What on the earth is going on inside?

50
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,470
My arms are still held.

51
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,160
I can't do any Jutsu.

52
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,840
Won't you let me go already?

53
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,130
I won't let this village get involved
in your wild ambition any more.

54
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,950
My ambition won't stop.

55
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,570
And you're going to die here.

56
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:59,800
You still say that, even aged, you have power
to save this village as the Third Hokage?

57
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,400
Do you understand the current situation?

58
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:19,560
Not only my own subordinates but also those from
the Hidden Sand are coming into this village.

59
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,890
You and Shinobi of Konoha will all
die, including the women and children.

60
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,480
The Konoha Kuzushi (Konoha Crash) succeeds here!

61
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,550
The inside is empty.

62
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,630
Nobody's there.

63
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,510
Strange...

64
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,250
Yes.

65
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,700
We came into the center of the Konoha village
but why haven't we had much of resistance?

66
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,900
Because...

67
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,310
Also, why have we not seen even one woman or child.

68
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,680
What's wrong, Konohamaru chan?

69
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,990
Gotta use the restroom.

70
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,200
Me, too.

71
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,190
Me, too.

72
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,130
It's an emergency situation now! It'll be
serious trouble if we are found by the enemies!

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,750
Go back to the room and be quiet!

74
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,300
That's not it... I need to pee.

75
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,660
Hold it!

76
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,120
I don't think I can hold it any longer.

77
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,450
Alright, then... I'll go with you to.

78
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,420
It's gonna leak! leak! leak!

79
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,160
That is the...

80
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,530
Finally, eh?

81
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,730
I'll definitely avenge you...

82
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
Gekkou Hayate.

83
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,650
That's the sign. Let's go.

84
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,410
Yes.

85
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,110
You don't understand, Orochimaru.

86
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't underestimate the Shinobi of this village!

87
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,190
Are you alright?

88
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,430
Yes.

89
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,580
Are they the last ones?

90
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,830
Yup. The evacuation is complete.

91
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,710
What do you mean?

92
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,840
The Konoha village has a plan in case
we get a surprise attack from an enemy.

93
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,840
The first stage is to eliminate the surprise attack units.

94
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,910
If elimination was not possible, then
immediately move onto the second stage.

95
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,200
In other words, the evacuation of all civilians.

96
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,190
We evacuate the women and children to
refuge areas all around the village.

97
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,570
Once it's completed we start the third stage.

98
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,590
The third stage?

99
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,400
To eliminate the enemy with what all that this village has!

100
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,160
That means...

101
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,040
The counter attacks begin now!

102
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,480
I won't let you go even one step further beyond here!

103
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,590
You've got to rescue Sakura with everything you have.

104
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,430
I'll protect Sakura-chan no matter what!

105
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,050
You're going to be killed by me.

106
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,390
My existence won't be erased.

107
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,700
I've got my back to the wall. I have
to stop this monster Tanuki soon.

108
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,120
Please.

109
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,470
Just a little bit is fine...

110
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,170
for me.

111
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,010
Give me your chakra!

112
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,770
What're you doing? The enemy is only one person!

113
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,910
Hyuga is the strongest in Konoha. Remember that!

114
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,560
My body can't...

115
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,840
move!

116
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,760
Is this the first time for you to experience the  secret
of Konoha, Kageshibari no Jutsu? (Bind with Shadow)

117
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,370
If that's the case, take this one also.

118
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,470
The  secret of Konoha, Kage Kubi Shibari
no Jutsu. (Tie the Neck with Shadow)

119
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,060
Baika no Jutsu (Multi size)

120
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,180
Shin Ran Shin no Jutsu (Spirit and Body Switch)

121
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,910
What?

122
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,150
My body moves against my will!

123
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,150
Stop it! Stop it!

124
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,410
This reminds me the old times.

125
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,670
Yup.

126
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,560
It's the reunion of the Ino-Shika-Cho trio

127
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,300
Kuromaru, you ready?!

128
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,300
Yup!

129
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:08,630
The Shinobi of Konoha will fight, risking
their lives, to protect this village.

130
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:17,950
The real power in this world is not through archiving all Ninjutsu.

131
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,620
The poison in my body is...

132
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,570
Don't move, Shino. I put my bugs into you.

133
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,750
They're removing the poison from your body.

134
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,350
Father...

135
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,060
I believe I taught you once that...

136
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,280
...when you protect your precious people,
the real power of Shinobi will appear.

137
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,630
I will protect everybody!

138
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,920
Ready? Stupid Tanuki!

139
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,420
Die!

140
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,400
God Damn it!

141
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,750
Did he win?

142
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,870
Just a head bang...

143
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,840
Though his fighting style isn't smart at all,

144
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,930
I'm surprised that he pulled more
chakra when he's at his limit.

145
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:55,050
I've never seen such a clumsy Ninja, but he's the
first kid in long time to be the out of this world.

146
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,900
It's too bad that I can't see this
till the end, but I'm also at my limit.

147
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,040
Gamakichi, we're going home now.

148
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,890
Alright, dad.

149
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,910
Even I'm empty now.

150
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,250
You, too, right?

151
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,320
Let's make this the end for us...

152
00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:01,730
I guess I don't have enough power
to pull your entire soul out...

153
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,240
But your ambition ends here, too.

154
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,290
Not yet!

155
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,020
My ambition won't stop yet!

156
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:17,780
I'll give you the punishment that suits you.
You are addicted and extremely proud of Jutsu..

157
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,640
...so I'll take all your Jutsu with me.

158
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,880
What did you say?

159
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,040
You don't say...

160
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,700
Stop it!

161
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,150
Fuuin! (Seal)

162
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,010
My arms!

163
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,670
You won't be able use both of your arms anymore.

164
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,410
Since you can't use your arms, you can't form hand seals.

165
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,050
You no longer have any Ninjutsu.

166
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,080
Your Konoha Kuzushi (Konoha Crash) fails here.

167
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,530
You, old man!

168
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,660
Give me my arms back!

169
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,410
How foolish of you, Orochimaru.

170
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,010
I'm regret that we can't go together, but, my foolish subordinate...

171
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,110
I'll see you in other world later.

172
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:38,000
How dare you... you dying old man... Taking my Jutsu!

173
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,580
Fire will be aflame where the leaves dance.

174
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,250
The shadow of the fire will light the village and...

175
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,050
... the leaves will sprout once again.

176
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,400
The Third...

177
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,120
The will you were talking about...

178
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,370
...seems to be carried over by...

179
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,270
