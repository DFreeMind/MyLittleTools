1
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:17,175
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,612
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:29,883
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:34,089
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,463
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,838
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:49,432
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,811
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,814
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:00,182
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:02,650
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:08,524
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,193
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,597
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:19,468
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,734
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:24,276
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:27,711
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:47,892
<i>A Battle of Bugs!</i>
<i>The Deceivers and the Deceived!</i>

21
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,269
What the heck is happening...?

22
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,866
Why does Hinata have
to be kidnapped?!

23
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:59,438
Why are there guys who know
that we're searching for Bikochu?!

24
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,672
We were being watched all this time.
Ever since we arrived...

25
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,741
You were aware of that?!

26
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:07,947
You're the only one who didn't know.

27
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:10,648
Why didn't you tell me?!

28
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,851
Because if we told you,
you'd have raised a big fuss!

29
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:16,521
And the insects would flee!
All the insects...!

30
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,130
Including the Bikochu!

31
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,000
If they tried to steal the Bikochu
from us through force,

32
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:28,199
the insects would be in danger
of getting hurt.

33
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,408
So they captured Hinata and
decided to go with a hostage exchange.

34
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:33,901
That's very smart of them.

35
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,906
Something smells sweet...

36
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,542
It's the smell of honey.

37
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:40,944
Bee's honey...

38
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:42,243
Bees...?

39
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:47,186
Hinata's scent ends here...

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,792
In that case...

41
00:02:57,237 --> 00:03:00,070
Those guys waited for a moment when
Hinata was alone

42
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,471
and attacked her using bees.

43
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,603
I've heard that in the Hidden Stone Village
in the Land of Earth,

44
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:09,307
there's a clan of insect handlers
who primarily use bees.

45
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,882
The name of that clan is...
the Kamizuru Clan.

46
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,079
Kamizuru? That's a name
that isn't heard very often.

47
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:20,916
Seems they were once hailed as being
at a level equal to the Aburame Clan...

48
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,825
But they aren't anymore?

49
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,463
This is a story from
the times of my grandfather...

50
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,663
There was a time when the Shinobi
of the Hidden Stone Village

51
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,637
were going to invade the Leaf Village...

52
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,074
The Kamizuru Clan was designated
to spearhead the operation...

53
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,204
The plan was to create
a disruption by releasing

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,545
a large swarm of bees into the village
followed by an invading main unit...

55
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:47,447
However, the Aburame Clan
wised up to that

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,181
and prepared to engage the enemy
in the forest to the west!

57
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,928
This battle between insect handlers
which had no precedent in history...

58
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,469
ended in the Aburame's victory...

59
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,441
With this battle as the turning point,

60
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,480
the Aburame Clan rose to
unchallenged status

61
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,572
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

62
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,416
On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan
was subjected to cold treatment

63
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,146
even in their own village.

64
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,086
I've heard that only a few of them
remain now...

65
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,458
So those people came here
to capture Bikochu, huh?

66
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:34,425
What the heck are those guys
planning to do with the Bikochu?

67
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:40,271
If my insects come back
we might be able to learn something...

68
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,508
<i>I see... I've been captured...</i>

69
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:24,512
The Village Hidden in the Leaves is
in a difficult situation right now...

70
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,117
Because of that incident
at the recent Chunin exam?

71
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:31,649
The Hokage was assassinated,
and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.

72
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,293
Times are about to change dramatically...

73
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,396
This is a chance for us,
the Kamizuru Clan,

74
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,297
to distinguish ourselves.

75
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:44,866
But to do that...

76
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,632
The founder's Book of Secrets, huh?

77
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,007
A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu
for Insect Handlers

78
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,874
are apparently inscribed therein
among other things...

79
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,004
If we possessed that at the time of
the battle with the Aburame Clan,

80
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,346
we wouldn't have lost...

81
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:02,280
However, Clan members have continued
to search for it for many years,

82
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:03,754
but couldn't find it.

83
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:07,090
Do you really think
we can find it after all this time?

84
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,388
That's why we need the Bikochu...

85
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:15,797
I brought the keepsakes
of the founder, my grandfather, with me...

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,899
When the Bikochu emerges,
it will pursue the scent it recognizes.

87
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,668
And we should be able
to locate the Book of Secrets

88
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,405
that Grandfather hid just
as he was dying.

89
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,348
This strand of his hair
will surely lead us to it.

90
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,981
If we get our hands on
the Book of Secrets

91
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,384
and if we engage in some big action...

92
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,252
I am certain that... the people of
the village will also acknowledge us.

93
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:45,327
<i>Those people are also desperately</i>
<i>seeking recognition.</i>

94
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,293
<i>Naruto...</i>

95
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,812
Did you find out anything?
How about Hinata's whereabouts?

96
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,690
No... The other insects were probably
also done in by those guys.

97
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:17,018
Damn! Then our only choice
is to do what they want?

98
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,291
When I went to all that
trouble of finding it...

99
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,793
So you want to desert Hinata?

100
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,663
H-How could anyone possibly do that?!

101
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:28,702
I won't desert her no matter
what might happen!

102
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,373
Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!

103
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,041
Exactly.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,812
But then we'd be able to locate Sasuke
if we have this guy here...

105
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,946
Well, I guess we'll have to think of
some other method of finding Sasuke.

106
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:46,717
Yeah... Right now, the first thing
we need to do is rescue Hinata.

107
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,889
But, do you think Hinata
would be satisfied with that?

108
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:55,091
The person who originally
thought up this plan was Hinata.

109
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,725
Huh? But...

110
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:00,498
It's true that I told her about
the existence of Bikochu...

111
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,701
However...

112
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:08,144
The odds of finding
a Bikochu are extremely low...

113
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,541
We thought that she should aspire
to an important mission

114
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:16,179
with an assured outcome for the village,
rather than a mission with such low odds.

115
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,425
But Hinata didn't give up.

116
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,293
She argued persistently that
if there was even a small possibility,

117
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,560
one should take on the challenge.

118
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,731
Th That Hinata did...?

119
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:39,534
She was extremely forceful and
Shino and I had no choice but to agree.

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,142
It's the first time Hinata
ever volunteered for a mission.

121
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,976
For that reason too,
I want to make this a success.

122
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:49,045
Yeah.

123
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:53,586
But when we don't know
where Hinata is, how are we...?

124
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,453
There is one place where Hinata
will definitely make an appearance.

125
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,464
I see! The place where...

126
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:04,034
...the exchange with
the Bikochu takes place!

127
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,365
We will definitely have
a chance at that time.

128
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:11,043
All right!
We will recover Hinata without fail...

129
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,943
and we will also protect
the Bikochu to the very end!

130
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:26,582
We brought the Bikochu!
Return Hinata!

131
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,295
Place the insect cage
on that rock over there!

132
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:33,762
Hinata!

133
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,899
Release Hinata!

134
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,901
I must verify it first!

135
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,943
What's... the meaning of this?!

136
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,286
Are you trying to make a mockery
of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!

137
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,926
A goliath beetle...
You gotta be kidding!

138
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:04,985
Now, Shino!

139
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,161
What?!

140
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:07,397
Parasitic Insects!

141
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,466
Heh! Recovery successful!

142
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:14,265
All right!

143
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:18,502
Damn!

144
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:20,942
Naruto!

145
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,277
All right, resign yourselves!

146
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,116
Your time's up!

147
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,292
What's this?

148
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:41,658
This one doesn't smell like Hinata!

149
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,098
Huh?!

150
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:45,901
Just as I thought...

151
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,007
Beeswax?

152
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:52,803
There they come!

153
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:57,448
Damn! You jerk! You jerk!

154
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,545
Damn! All these things are honey?!

155
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:05,089
Sorry, Naruto...
But these damn bees!

156
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,283
There's no end to them!

157
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,919
Do we need to slash them
if they're honey?!

158
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,126
You two don't move from there!

159
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,524
Huh?

160
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,426
This is the genuine thing!
And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.

161
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,535
It appears that genuine ones
are mixed in...

162
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,168
But they're indistinguishable
from each other!

163
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:25,967
Back me up for a little!

164
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:27,843
Wall of Insects Jutsu!

165
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,324
A Awesome...

166
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,958
Amazing power for a Genin...

167
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,839
As might be expected from
the Aburame Clan... I guess.

168
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:56,907
The Kamizuru Clan...

169
00:11:57,943 --> 00:12:01,037
Huh...? So you were aware
of that fact.

170
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,944
Return Hinata!

171
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,683
Of course, our intention was
to return her...

172
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:09,054
But only if you calmly hand over
the Bikochu.

173
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:11,518
However...

174
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,725
It looks like you have
no intention of doing that!

175
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,017
In that case,
what do you plan on doing?

176
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,718
If you're an insect handler,

177
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,027
you wouldn't bring a delicate insect
like the Bikochu

178
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,363
to a dangerous place
like a battleground...

179
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,302
We'll finish you off right here...

180
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,033
and take our time afterwards
to search for the Bikochu!

181
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,241
Wall of Insects Jutsu!

182
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:36,110
That one doesn't have
any other tricks, huh!

183
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,380
Shino! Paper Bombs!

184
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,755
Take this!

185
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,168
<i>1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!</i>

186
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:07,437
Insect Clones...?

187
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,275
<i>Up to your annoying tricks, huh...</i>

188
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,818
Shino! What are we gonna do now?!

189
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,085
Don't you think we should
go back there for a moment?

190
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,426
Those guys
might find the Bikochu!

191
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:26,889
No... that location will definitely be safe.

192
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,630
More importantly, the first thing
we need to do is search for Hinata!

193
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:51,587
There's no mistake.

194
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,317
Inside here.

195
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:56,951
Hinata! Where are you?!

196
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,325
Hey! Be careful!

197
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,965
There's no sign of those guys,
but it might be a trap...

198
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:04,836
Is she there?!

199
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,499
Hinata?

200
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:15,679
Hinata!

201
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:19,250
Are you all right, Hinata?

202
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,455
I'll rescue you in a moment!

203
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,927
Just a little more!

204
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,840
All right... I got it off!

205
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:43,840
Naruto...

206
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,809
Thank you!

207
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,437
H-Hinata?!

208
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:55,618
H Hinata... stop that!

209
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,252
What do you think you're doing,
out of the blue like that?!

210
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:01,749
Who... are you?

211
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,792
What are you talking about, Shino?
That's Hinata.

212
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:08,365
If you're really Hinata,

213
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:12,530
you'd get red in the face
and faint if you hugged Naruto.

214
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,468
- Huh?
- Oh!

215
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:17,442
I see... But Akamaru's nose wouldn't fail...

216
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,744
What? The smell of two people
is mingled?

217
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,139
You're not Hinata?

218
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,053
Naruto... It's me...
I'm Hinata, believe me.

219
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,481
In that case...

220
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,548
show us what you tried to stick
on Naruto's back right now!

221
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:38,787
A Paper Bomb?

222
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:42,164
So you were intending
to blow up Naruto!

223
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,706
I thought that would work...

224
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:52,707
You are...

225
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,639
I see, the one on the hill
was a clone, huh...

226
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:59,250
Wearing Hinata's clothes...

227
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,781
That's how she was able
to compromise the smell.

228
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,978
Where is the real Hinata?!

229
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,714
I wonder where she could be?

230
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,563
I see...

231
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:19,661
Suzumebachi lured
the Aburame Clan, huh?

232
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,564
Well, it appears that your comrades...

233
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:25,804
place more value on the Bikochu
than on you.

234
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,912
There's nobody else coming
to rescue you.

235
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:36,011
Jibachi, Let's search for
the Bikochu that those guys hid!

236
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,850
There's not much time until sunrise!

237
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,256
Right!

238
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:43,351
Don't even try to escape.

239
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,831
If you make even the smallest movement
out of the ordinary,

240
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,662
those bees will cut the string

241
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:53,901
Up ahead is the entrance to
a labyrinthine underground water vein...

242
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,036
If you fall in, you'll pass into
the other world in an instant.

243
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,813
We don't wish to kill
anyone unnecessarily.

244
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:07,116
If you want to live,
I suggest you just stay quiet.

245
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:13,885
<i>How mortifying... I ended up being</i>
<i>a burden to everyone, after all.</i>

246
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:21,097
You guys are just like summer insects
who fly right into the fire!

247
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,300
If you're lucky, we'll meet again...

248
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:37,312
That place isn't just an ordinary cave.

249
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,322
Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!

250
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,286
There's nothing else to grab on to.

251
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,085
Be patient until I've checked
the surroundings!

252
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,595
No!

253
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,632
A huge number of bee larvae!

254
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:03,908
Bee larvae, huh?

255
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,237
But what's with their unusual huge size?

256
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:13,115
If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu,
I'll spare your life.

257
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:14,311
I refuse!

258
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:19,114
Searching for the Bikochu is
the mission that we were given!

259
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,057
Then die!

260
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,554
Paper Bombs!

261
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:28,063
Damn! Let's go, Akamaru!

262
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:30,932
Fang Over Fang!

263
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,229
<i>That sound is...</i>

264
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:39,570
<i>I see... They're still continuing to fight</i>
<i>without giving up.</i>

265
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,371
<i>This is not the time to be crying...</i>

266
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:46,540
<i>There's no way that I can give up.</i>
<i>I suggested this whole thing!</i>

267
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,186
<i>Byakugan!</i>

268
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,815
<i>There are 13 bees...</i>
<i>attached to the string.</i>

269
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,120
<i>If I can take them all down at once...</i>
<i>I'll be saved.</i>

270
00:18:56,795 --> 00:19:00,595
<i>But, to take down bees that small...</i>

271
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:14,703
Impossible! This guy...

272
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:23,083
I told you before...
I don't know... when to give up.

273
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,146
<i>Naruto...</i>

274
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:29,326
<i>Yes... I won't give up either!</i>

275
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:33,689
<i>I need to concentrate and</i>
<i>control my Chakra...</i>

276
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:35,031
Fang Over Fang!

277
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,466
How many of them are there?!

278
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:46,569
Kiba!

279
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,982
I I can't muster any strength...
Somehow my body is...

280
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,249
No way!

281
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:59,185
The larvae in this hive's favorite food
is Chakra!

282
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,220
What?!

283
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,187
As long as you're in there,

284
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:05,822
they'll go through the wall
to suck up the Chakra...

285
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:09,627
What's the matter...?

286
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,169
So have you decided
to tell me the location?

287
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:29,383
<i>Now!</i>

288
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,859
<i>Four...</i>

289
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:40,629
<i>Five, six...ten...</i>

290
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,859
<i>Eleven, twelve, thirteen...</i>

291
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,424
<i>Damn!</i>

292
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:54,574
Summoning Jutsu!

293
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:05,913
Would you like to be the feed
for the larvae...

294
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,824
or would you like to get out of here
and become the prey of this girl here?

295
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:12,020
Choose whichever you like!

296
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,146
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

297
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:36,619
<i>And you become speechless</i>

298
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:42,619
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

299
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,857
<i>So you don't answer</i>

300
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:51,560
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

301
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:56,437
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

302
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,942
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

303
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:08,146
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

304
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:17,754
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

305
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:26,931
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

306
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:38,744
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

307
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,558
What should I do? My body won't move.

308
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,400
I proposed this mission myself
wanting to help Naruto, and yet...

309
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,994
I don't want to end up as
a burden to everyone anymore,

310
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:01,538
that's what I aimed for, but...

311
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,468
No, calm down.

312
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,007
I need to concentrate my Chakra
and remember that training!

313
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:10,772
I have no choice but to do it now!
That is the best I can do right now!

314
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,611
Next time: "Blaze Away, Byakugan!
This is My Ninja Way!!"
