2
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:47,632
He's totally late.

3
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,736
Ah... Where's Sasuke?

4
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,825
Dosu who's supposed to be my opponent isn't here either.

5
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,461
Hey, you two there...

6
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:05,130
Stop being anxious. Stand tall and show
your faces to the audience well.

7
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:26,883
In this final round, you guys are the main event.

8
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:32,805
Has Sasuke been found yet?

9
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:37,847
Teams made up of a few Anbu each
have been looking for him, but not yet...

10
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:42,280
Perhaps, he's already in Orochimaru's hands.

11
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,225
If that's the case, we won't be able to find him anymore...

12
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,160
I see.

13
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:58,741
Oh... it's you, Mr. Kazekage.

14
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,353
You must be tired from the long trip to here.

15
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:21,637
No. It is good that this stage is in Konoha.

16
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:29,583
Even though you're still young, it would be hard journey for
you, Hokage-sama, if you needed to go to another location.

17
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,814
Isn't it better for you to decide the next Fifth soon?

18
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:46,857
Don't treat me like an old man. I plan
to stay for at least another five years.

19
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:58,927
Well... We should start it soon.

20
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:14,758
Ladies and Gentleman. Thank you for coming
to Konoha-gakure (hidden Leaf) Chunin Exam.

21
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:22,475
From now, the final round for the eight
who passed the prelims will start.

22
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:26,078
Please stay until the end.

23
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:31,944
If it's for eight, then I see one missing.

24
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,683
Before the matches begin, I have something I need to say.

25
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,358
Look at this.

26
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:53,523
There was a little change in tournament blocks.

27
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,185
Confirm whose your opponent once again.

28
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:03,048
I had one more match then everybody else before...

29
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,810
I guess Dosu forfeit.

30
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,860
I thought I'd finish you here.

31
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:22,806
That gives me the possibility to go against
Sasuke since I'm the odd one out in the first round.

32
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:29,226
What are you anyway!

33
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,372
Hey... Excuse me!

34
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,163
What is it?

35
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:44,792
Sasuke isn't here yet... so what'll you do about him?

36
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:53,764
Did he really escape from the hospital room then?

37
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,673
I wonder if something happened to him.

38
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:06,605
If he doesn't come here by the time his match starts, then...

39
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,127
he loses without a fight.

40
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:18,923
It's strange. From his character, he should
be here even if he has to drag his body.

41
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,684
Where're you going, Gaara?

42
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,934
I'm going to verify my existence.

43
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,563
Once more!

44
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,064
What's up? You can still move, can't you?

45
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,458
Sasuke, come on!

46
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:19,350
I told him repeatedly not to do something fishy, but...

47
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:24,807
I wonder if he killed the kid, Uchiha Sasuke, too...

48
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,935
Listen, you guys.

49
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,811
There are geographical differences, but the rule
is that there's no rules like in the prelims.

50
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:40,028
The match lasts until one of you die or admit defeat.

51
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,953
But if I judge the match is over, I'll stop it then.

52
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,343
I won't allow you to argue against me.

53
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,496
Understand?

54
00:07:55,223 --> 00:08:03,744
Well, the first match is Uzumaki Naruto and Hyuga Neji.

55
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:08,095
Other than those two, go back to the waiting room.

56
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:20,408
Byakugan VS Kagebunshin! I'm gonna win no matter what!!

57
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:29,231
Hey, Hinata. Those seats are open.

58
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,994
This'll be an impressive match.

59
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,054
I can understand that you're worried about Sasuke-kun.

60
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,859
But I think you should give
Naruto a little cheer, shouldn't you?

61
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:56,653
Yeah, you're right.

62
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,276
But, there's no possibility for
Naruto to win because his opponent is Neji.

63
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,121
That isn't true!

64
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,094
Can you be certain?

65
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:12,230
Anyway, who'd imagine that kid survived until now...

66
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:19,834
This will be the end for Naruto
who survived with just his luck.

67
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:27,184
His opponent is too strong. He won't win
against the Hyuga clan no matter how hard he tries.

68
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:38,009
Well, I thought the same at first. But
you'll be surprised if you underestimate him.

69
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:42,110
What's wrong, Akamaru?

70
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,286
What did you say?

71
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,307
Where?

72
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,169
There!

73
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:04,334
Why is an Anbu at a place like this?
Is something going on here?

74
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,245
You seem like you want to say something.

75
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,072
I told you before, too...

76
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:36,819
A loser is a loser after all. You can never change!

77
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,664
I promise...

78
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,129
I'm gonna win no matter what!

79
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,692
Those are eyes that show he believes in himself completely.

80
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,662
There's no overconfidence.

81
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:09,924
It's more worthwhile fighting against you.

82
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:15,992
When you face the true reality, those
eyes will show disappointment.

83
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:18,570
I'm looking forward to seeing those eyes.

84
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,966
Stop talking so much...

85
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:29,110
Let's begin already!

86
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,661
Well, let the first match...

87
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:38,887
Begin!

88
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:48,659
You should watch it carefully, Hanabi. There's no other
person who has inherited the Hyuga's blood-limit so much.

89
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,517
It's needless to say your big sister is less than him.

90
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:53,893
More than my sister?

91
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:57,136
Perhaps, more than you.

92
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,290
He's not somebody you can beat with a fart this time.

93
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:06,950
That guy also has that thing.

94
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,909
A close battle is taboo.

95
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,613
Does he understand that, Naruto?

96
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,082
Idiot! What is he doing by attacking from the front?!

97
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,738
No! Naruto!

98
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:08,633
The guy can see Tenketsu (chakra holes)!

99
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,732
It's called Tenketsu...

100
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:19,124
It is said that by pressing exactly on those body points,
you can control the chakra flow of the opponent...

101
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:23,229
and stop it or increase it as you wish.

102
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,893
Not good.

103
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,718
I missed it?

104
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:44,778
That means, if I get too close to him, he'll push
those points and I won't be able to use any Jutsu.

105
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:48,238
I have no other choice than to fight from a distance.

106
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:53,417
Now you understand it, don't
you? You don't have a chance to win.

107
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:59,131
I was just testing your ability.

108
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:12,563
The real battle starts from now!

109
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:19,587

Kagebunshin-no-jutsu!

110
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:27,154
You used your brain, Naruto! With Kagebunshin...

111
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,319
Interesting kid.

112
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,872
Kagebunshin is a jutsu at Jonin level.

113
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,152
I didn't know he can use that jutsu.

114
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,608
The outcome isn't so obvious anymore.

115
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,865
Kagebunshin?

116
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:52,979
I see... Because his chakra is
equally distributed among all the clones,

117
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,239
I can't easily tell the real body even with my Byakugan.

118
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:02,189
But after all, there is only one real body.

119
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,857
Don't bluff.

120
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:08,214
Come at me if you want to come.

121
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:16,894
It's useless in front of the Neji's defense.

122
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,763
He's not at all offensive.

123
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:29,457
Don't underestimate me!

124
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,511
He's coming.

125
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,580
Got him!

126
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,547
Foolish.

127
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,027
Shit. I'll have him next time.

128
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,209
Here!

129
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:54,560
Does he have eyes on his back?

130
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,801
You'll become Hokage, eh?

131
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:11,715
I guess it won't be possible with this.

132
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:18,831
I can tell most things with these eyes...

133
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:27,915
Talent is decided when the person is born. In other
words, everything is decided when one is born.

134
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,033
Why?

135
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,419
Why do you always jump to a conclusion like that?

136
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:45,635
Then, you say anybody can become Hokage
just because of his hard work?

137
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:53,024
Only a handful Shinobi can be chosen to become Hokage.

138
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,509
See the reality well.

139
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:00,477
Those who become Hokage are born with such a fate.

140
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:06,545
It's not they become one because they tried
to be. It is decided by their fate.

141
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:13,266
Each person is different. We need to
live in the flow that you can't go against.

142
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:23,441
The only one fate that everybody equally has is...

143
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,464
death.

144
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:44,950
Those eyes... He's still holds a grudge against
the Souke (main family) as I expected.

145
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,026
So?

146
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,427
So what?

147
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:04,984
I'm not good at giving up.

148
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,486
Kagebunshin no jutsu!

149
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,385
What's going on anyway? I, the one
who gives a blow, is blown away!

150
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:52,727
But I promised Hinata.

151
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,882
I can't lose here!

152
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:59,792
Next episode Zero blind spots! Another Absolute Defense

153
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:07,025
Good news! The Year 2004 Naruto Calendar
will be given to 30 randomly chosen people!

154
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:11,525
