The Fourth Hokage has been my student, time makes.

65
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,699
In some way, you and the Quarter resembled a lot.

66
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,119
Therefore, this is the single reason!

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,041
I.... am similar the Fourth Hokage?

68
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,632
What happens?

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,053
If it is true that I and the Quarter resemble themselves…

70
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,222
… it means that we have also the same talent, just?

71
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,974

They are landed on one cacca of dog.

75
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,248
The single thing that you have in common you and the Quarter…

76
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,042
… they are the blond hats and your cocciutaggine.

77
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,754

You could carry this Ohagi to house of Ino-chan?

82
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,905

I have some also for Naruto… even if task will not eat them.

92
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,650
Hey, Kakashi-Sensei, I want to learn also the Chidori.
(Technical of the Thousand hawks)

But from i, you stop it, Sasuke-kun. Six too much modest one.

103
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,447
I know that Naruto is a lot improved…

104
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,448
But that boy of the Sand…

105
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,449
E' the pure truth.

106
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,830
That boy…

107
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,709
He has put its life to risk also to save to you.

108
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,171
He has shown for before turns its true force.

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,257
E' be Naruto …

110
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,094

111
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,309
Chidori!

112
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,604

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,607

116
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,674
They are not successful to make nothing.

117
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,801
Not…

118
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,720
I do not want more to see…

119
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,472
… my more beloveds friends to die in front of my eyes…

120
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,891

121
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,102
I do not want more …

122
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:58,896
At all costs…

123
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,983
…  the proteggerò!

124
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,069
Taijuu Kage Bunshin not Jutsu
(Technical of the Cloni d' Ombra Multiple)

125
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,745
Kuchiyose not Jutsu !
(Technical of Evocation)

126
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,965
Naruto is becoming more and more strong…

127
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,885
In comparison to he…

128
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,637
I…

129
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,952
E' an adversary to which you could hold head…

130
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,162
… I instead would not succeed to us.

131
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,581
E' too much strongly.

132
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,083
Sure.

133
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,670
If we attack it, we could remain murdered both.

134
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,464
Or moriremmo together to he.

135
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,926
Even if we had other men with we…

136
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,177
… the result would not change.

137
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,056
After all it is one of the three leggendari Sannin…

138
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,100
He would be a hard adversary…

139
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,102
… also for a member of the Clan Uchiha di Konoha…

140
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,315
… and for one of the seven Shinobi-Katana of the Fog.

141
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,191
.

142
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,359
But…

143
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:32,531
Also the more powerful men have they point weak person.

144
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,049
You stop it, before that they fall to you in head.

145
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,763
Hey, hey! Ero-Sennin !

146
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,893
Which kind of student has been the Quarter?

147
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:05,230
Task not to exaggerate saying that it is
become strong thanks to my instructions.

148
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,443
Inasmuch as six my student also you,
Naruto, six much lucky person.

149
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,281
Not me creeds?

150

A good ones teaching grows good students.
Normal E' not creeds?

151
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,953
Then… Then…

152
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,873
Ero-Sennin, who has been makes you to grow?

153
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,082
To me?

154
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,752
What it has taught to me all is the Third party.

155
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,295
The Third party?

156
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,588
.

157
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,550
The Third party was still enough young then.

158
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,177
The Third party?

159
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,553
Young person?

160
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,557
, and also I was young.

161
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,352
Young person? Haaaaaaa.

162
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,152
They are remained embedded.

163
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,113
You see! You I had said.

164
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,033
Inasmuch as…

165
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,452
… six state trained from Kakashi…

166
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,871
… you would have it are practiced with the door-bells, true?

167
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,125
, in fact. I have made!

168
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,097
They are the only one that it is remained legacy to that log, eternal damnation.

169
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,266
Ah? Also you?

170
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,267
What?

171
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,268
Also?

172
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:25,894
What means "Also "?

173
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,606
It leaves to lose, it raises to you and you replace them to place.

174
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,776
It goes well, but… I do not succeed to free to me.

175
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,827
There are only 2 door-bells, this means that…

176
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,288
One of we will remain without lunch.

177
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,082
Always six perspicacityes, Orochimaru.

178
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,626
Perfect! We begin!

179
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,589
In order to obtain them you will have to pass on my body!

180
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,104
Jiraiya, seems that it has gained the bet of new.

181
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,440
The always six losing usual.

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,484
Taci! Tsunade, six one flat child like one table!

183
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,363
Which thing you have said? Pervertito dirt!

184
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,075
Oh, oh, smettetela!

185
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,286
Tsunade and Orochimaru, gone to house.

186
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:24,995
It goes well.

187
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,092
Diamine, always you!

188
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,181
As you would call it a ninja that she falls
always in the more banal traps?

189
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,098
, but…

190
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,976
You would have to learn from Orochimaru.

191
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:52,648
Sarutobi-Sensei. You always say…
Orochimaru "here", Orochimaru ""…

192
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,611
When I make the guardone, they are best in applying
the camouflage techniques.

193
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:03,575
Idiot, to that they would serve these techniques of camouflage?

194
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,870
Nobody has never pecked me! E' the truth!

195
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,874
If what you say it is true…

196
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,710
Next time v errò  with you.

197
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,842
Sarutobi-Sensei, six pervertito.

198
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:26,932
What? What?

199
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,186
What is of cos ì  amusing, Ero-Sennin?

200
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:35,899
I have as soon as understood that a good ones teaching has a lot
to learn also from a its student. Understood?

201
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,236
I do not succeed to understand…

202
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,446
We go! You have replaced all to place?

203
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,240
, I have ended!

204
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,222
From as the things go…

205
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,766
… it seems that still they have not found Naruto.

206
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,101
Just for this …

207
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,895
It does not find the thing bizzarra?

208
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,690
Given the ability with which they are it infiltrates to you in this village…

209
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,444
… they must have already captured Naruto, you do not believe?

210
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,823
Itachi would have to know the face of Naruto.

211
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:27,784
Kakashi !

212
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,958
Why Kakashi is sleeping?

213
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,127
With all the Jounin to watch by it?

214
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,545
What is happening?

215
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,963
What has happened?

216
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,714
Not…

217
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,882
Nothing of ché…

218
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,925
Calm.

219
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,302
True E' that "that" Itachi is returned to the village?

220
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,681
And that… Naruto is trying?

221
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,897
Idiot!

222
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,364
Eternal damnation! Naruto?

223
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,623
E' returned to the village.

224
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,291
And Naruto is trying!

225
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,668
What means all this?

226
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,137
Sasuke-kun!

227
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,055
Where It is Naruto?

228
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,599
As soon as they have arrived…

229
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,477
I have carried to Naruto some ohagi.

230
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,981
If the hands put it lean, Naruto is died!

231
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,109
I will not allow  that it happens.

232
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,821
Old! Naruto must here have come before.

233
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,365
Sai for case… where has gone?

234
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,576
Oh, Naruto?

235
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,327
It makes to think me…

236
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,956
E' come with Jiraya-saint towards noon.

237
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,166
And they have taken of the ramen.

238
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,502
Then they had to go from some part.

239
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,503
Where?

240
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:07,050
It seems me to have understood that they went to the village
of Shikuba or something of similar.

241
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,763
Therefore it has left with Jiraiya-saint.

242
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,182
Jiraiya?

243
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,102
One of the 3 leggendari ninja Sannin, Jiraya.

244
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:22,858
Even if he seems only large old from hats white men.

245
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,902
Large… Hats White men …

246
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:33,827
Diamine. You could at least buy one cup of
ramen, after all these questions!

247
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,509
Dolcetti!

248
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,726
Sure that… is a just strange village.

249
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,619
Naruto !

250
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,455
Today we will stop ourselves here!

251
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,250
Ehh? They are still in a position to walking.

252
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,294
They are I the master, therefore I decide!

253
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,797
I want to only learn technical new.

254
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,258
Here why I have to you chosen like student.

255
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,946
Naruto!!

256
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,285
These are the keys of the room. It knows them on.

257
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,829
It concentrates to you on the Chakra… trains to you and then you go to sleep. OK?

258
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,205
What?

259
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,333
You are saying to me that it is hour that me it goes some to bed and you lasci alone.

260
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,960
It is not right, Ero-Sennin!

261
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,463
If they are directed to the Shikuba village, lacks little.

262
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,637
Every time that I find myself with Ero-Sennin, always goes to end cos ì.

263
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,103
They have arrived.

264
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,820
Dolcetti!

265
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,950
I must control in every store.

266
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,452
Health!

267
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,665
It will have intention of supervisionare my training truly?

268
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,426
That one here?

269
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,891
Ohh. Not mistake a blow.

270
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,228
For case they lodge a blond child here of
my height with the face from stupid…

271
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,688
… and large old from hats white men?

272
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,192
This hotel is only for women.

273
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,322
I am trying someone....

274
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,158

00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,368
…  and large old from hats white men…

276
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,286
This is one residence only for old.

277
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,212
Mmm… This lecca-lecca ago to pizzicare the language.

278
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,013

279

281
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,355
Hats white men?

282
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,481
They are found here?

283
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:54,361
Hmmm.. I am trying to remember if someone has arrived of the sort.

284
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,823

285

286
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,704
Oh… A blond child and old with hats white men.

287
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,746
They are found here?

288
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,956

289
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,958

00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,147

00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,816
Arrival.

00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,946
