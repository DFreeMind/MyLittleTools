"not to make the thing just, when you know that this

139
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,980
"Not being is soldier weak person who pu  ?

140
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,409
Eh?

141
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,968
They are the instructions of the fourth Hokage.

142
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:10,336
You must protect us ò  that it considers
important with both the arms.

143
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,676
Not to cry, Inari.

144
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,234
Because…

145
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,651

Also training to you you will not have
possibility against the men of Gatoo!

148
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,620
It does not import how much you efforts…

149
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,079
… how many heroic words you say some.

150
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,495
The weak people will always lose against strongest!

151
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:56,024
Taci!

152
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:58,375

You do not know null of this country,

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,318
… one that laughs all the time…

158
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,818
..e it does not have idea of what is the suffering.

159
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:15,342
E' for that you expect of being…

160
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,342
… the protagonist of the tragedy
and to always cry?

161
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,830
An idiot like you pu ò
to only continue to cry!

162
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,066
Six solo a piagnucolone!

163
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:25,941
Naruto!

164
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,516
You have exaggerated.

165
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,216
Naruto…

166
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:56,996
It goes you to speak?

167
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,688
Naruto has not said to you
those things with badness.

168
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,686
E' a testone.

169
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:19,169
Tazuna-saint it has spoken to us about your father.

170
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:24,938
Naruto like you and without father from birth.

171
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:28,055
Currently it does not know who were its parents.

172
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,010
Neanche it has not never had a friend.

173
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:39,036
However, I have not never seen it
to make the scontroso or to cry.

174
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:40,932
It tries constantly…

175
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:45,168
… to earn the respect of the others.

176
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:50,045
And always he has been able to lead
its life towards its dream.

177
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:56,722
Sure it is tired to cry.

178
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:08,405
E' for that it knows what means
to be strong, just as your father.

179
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:11,548
Naruto is what it understands to you better.

180
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:16,980
Sure first Naruto…

181
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:20,392
… it has tried to dirti this.

182
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:26,711
That it also it has repeated
to if same many times.

183
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:41,481
Please, it is taken care of Naruto.

184
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:47,359
Spremuto its body to the maximum.

185
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,009
Task that in order today will not succeed to move.

186
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:54,409
