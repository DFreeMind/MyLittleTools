1
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:26,245
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,516
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,722
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:40,096
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:45,471
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:49,065
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,444
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,447
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,815
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,283
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:08,157
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,898
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,230
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,101
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,367
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,909
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:27,344
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,454
Shikamaru! Ino! Choji!

21
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,531
Heh... Well...

22
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,328
It's a drag,
but it's Lady Tsunade's orders.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,930
Old Lady Tsunade's...?

24
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,540
You're pursuing Mizuki, right?

25
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,569
Y Yeah...!

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,275
And... who are these guys here?

27
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,782
Fujin and Raijin.

28
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,589
Fujin... and Raijin?

29
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:15,285
Yeah. They're a little weak upstairs,
but their brute strength...

30
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,525
is Herculean, surpassing even that
of the Legendary Sannin.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,497
Are you serious?

32
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:24,459
Damn... It looks like he really means it.

33
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,468
Pretty amazing that they are able
to hold out

34
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:36,014
against the Shadow Possession Jutsu
only by using their strength...

35
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,411
<i>It looks like this is gonna turn</i>
<i>into a troublesome situation again...</i>

36
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,082
Leave this to us...
You go pursue Mizuki!

37
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:46,458
We'll be fine!

38
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,356
Leave it to us!

39
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,155
Awright!

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,527
But be careful!

41
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:59,630
Those guys are crazy like monsters!

42
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,440
Yeah... I can see that.

43
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,035
Go, Naruto!

44
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:09,174
Thanks, guys!

45
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:10,443
We better hurry, Naruto!

46
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,053
Your opponents are this way!

47
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:20,625
You guys... Doing this kind of thing
to us brothers!

48
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:23,057
Don't even think we're gonna
let you leave here alive!

49
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,793
Well... I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

50
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:29,597
Choji! Ino! Let's hurry and
take care of these guys!

51
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:30,800
- Okay!
- Okay!

52
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:35,439
<i>A New Formation.</i>
<i>Ino Shika Cho!</i>

53
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:38,167
Wait, Mizuki!

54
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,543
Looks like I'm gonna
have a little fun, Iruka!

55
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:53,689
This way?

56
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,565
Mizuki! Where are you?

57
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,416
D Damn!

58
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:20,278
This is Genjutsu...

59
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,055
Release!

60
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,937
After Genjutsu...
Puppets come, huh?

61
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,905
His Jutsu are diverse.

62
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,814
<i>And moreover, the timing of</i>
<i>his Jutsu are superb...</i>

63
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,212
<i>I was really close to</i>
<i>being taken down...</i>

64
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,717
<i>I wouldn't have imagined that</i>

65
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,919
<i>he could have such full command</i>
<i>of the high level Jutsu...that Mizuki.</i>

66
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,895
I guess I can praise you on catching that
the Puppet was real.

67
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,569
However... I wonder how long

68
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,504
you're gonna be able to continue
to engag e in my game, Iruka!

69
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:16,238
Where's this...?!

70
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:27,848
<i>This ain't good...</i>

71
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:30,121
<i>They're able to repel</i>
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu</i>

72
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,884
<i>using only their strength...</i>

73
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,227
Shikamaru, I'll go!

74
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,297
Choji!

75
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:45,102
Stop it! Their strength is unearthly!

76
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,166
I'll hold this guy down...

77
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,232
While I do that take care
of the other one!

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,269
Okay! All right, let's go, Ino!

79
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:54,779
Leave it to me!

80
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,483
Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu!

81
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,255
What's the matter, Elder Brother?

82
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,088
<i>A success!</i>

83
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,566
Oops...

84
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:18,067
All right!

85
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,937
Formation, Ino Shika Cho
completed!

86
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:27,772
Elder Brother!
What's the matter, Elder Brother?!

87
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,949
<i>Iruka Sensei...</i>
<i>I'll catch up with you in no time...</i>

88
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,913
<i>Please be safe!</i>

89
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,863
How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?

90
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,695
Pretty good for being self taught,
wouldn't you say?

91
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,670
I can't understand...

92
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:59,139
You have the ability to use
such high level Ninjutsu to this degree...

93
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,510
why would you waste it?!

94
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,419
As always, trying to impose
your morals on me, huh...?!

95
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,453
You're so lukewarm!
You're so nave!

96
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,893
Don't you start preaching me!

97
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,029
I won't acknowledge you,
no matter what!

98
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,860
I consistently hardened my heart
and carried out my missions...

99
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,668
Despite that, those guys in the village...

100
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,569
No matter how strong I was!

101
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:33,141
No matter how many enemies
I took down in my missions!

102
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,573
Those guys didn't even attempt
to acknowledge me!

103
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:39,147
Saying we're comrades,
it's all about teamwork...

104
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:42,153
They were all bound
by stupid rules!

105
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,987
His target' s the Secret Manuscript.

106
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,524
Backup Mizuki!

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,551
Right!

108
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,265
Hey! Are you all right?!

109
00:07:56,068 --> 00:08:00,129
I I can't feel my leg...

110
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,808
What do you think, Mizuki?

111
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:11,778
It's no good.
It's unfortunate, but he can no longer...

112
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,680
I see...

113
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,847
All right! Let's withdraw!

114
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,084
Hurry!

115
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,019
Yeah...

116
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,787
It's unfortunate, but...

117
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:28,091
Guys who are of no use
on the battleground

118
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,032
only become a ball and chain...

119
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,160
Even though it's just a minor injury,

120
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,172
you won't be able to move
from this place...

121
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:35,496
If you're wanna blame someone,

122
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:37,065
I suggest you blame
your own helpless self!

123
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:43,614
I simply carried out
my mission faithfully.

124
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,009
And despite that, those guys
in the village...

125
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,314
Not one of them even attempted
to acknowledge me...

126
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:56,154
Why?! Why didn't anybody
acknowledge my strength?!

127
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,789
Why?! Iruka...!

128
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:05,168
When you and even that Nine Tailed brat
are acknowledged, why only me...?

129
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,067
It's still not too late.

130
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,169
If you pay for your crimes
and start afresh,

131
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,871
the people in the village will certainly...

132
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:18,315
How cocky! Don't preach to me!

133
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,220
You're just the same as
those other guys in the village!

134
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:24,384
You disdain me, don't you?!

135
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:26,022
Mizuki...

136
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,122
Everything...

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,887
That's right...
Everything began that day...

138
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,994
What are you gonna do,
getting nervous now?

139
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,636
Mizuki...

140
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,141
It finally takes place tomorrow,
doesn't it?

141
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,576
The Academy's teacher
recruitment exam...

142
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,344
Yeah... It's weighing heavily on me.

143
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:52,907
I'm envious of you.
Your scores are better than mine.

144
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,182
You'll breeze right through
tomorrow's exam.

145
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:01,057
Not quite... Well, in any case,
let's both do our best!

146
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:02,621
Yeah!

147
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,107
Damn!

148
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:25,946
Lie low!

149
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,482
That was close, Iruka!

150
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:30,451
Yeah...

151
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,691
Mizuki... Thank you.
You really helped me out!

152
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,826
It's mutual...
Come on, let's hurry!

153
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,666
Ninja Academy
Exam Results

154
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,436
Number 7 - Iruka Umino

155
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:50,373
I I did it...

156
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,674
I did it!

157
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,280
Mizuki...

158
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,206
Exam Office

159
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:02,747
Now then, regarding Mizuki...
we will adopt a wait and see attitude.

160
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,550
Yes, it can't be helped.

161
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,183
I agree...
The questions that were raised

162
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,957
at the time of that mission to
recover the Secret Manuscript...

163
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:16,298
Until those are completely cleared up...
It can't be helped, can it?

164
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,532
According to the autopsy report...

165
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,335
the cause of death to that corpse
was given as suffocation.

166
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,541
In Mizuki and the others' reports,

167
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,774
it stated that the leg injury
was not that serious...

168
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,449
I understand...

169
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,808
He's brilliant but it can't be helped.

170
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:43,557
I was just carrying out the mission
that I was assigned to do!

171
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:50,368
Can you understand how miserable
the life I've led has been since then?!

172
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:53,267
Huh? Iruka?!

173
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,735
You have no idea, do you?

174
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,468
I have undergone
so many hardships,

175
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,410
and you, who has had it so easy...

176
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,573
Which one of us is the true Shinobi...

177
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,813
Let's clarify that once and for all,
shall we?!

178
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,989
Now then come! Iruka!

179
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,862
Mizuki... Where are you?!

180
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,304
You don't have any intention
of reforming yourself, do you?!

181
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:31,499
Don't make me say the same thing
over and over again!

182
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,141
Then I'll bring this to an end now...

183
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,044
It's very unfortunate, though!

184
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:39,481
What a tearjerker...

185
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:41,779
It makes me happy too, Iruka...

186
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,760
Elder Brother?!
What's the matter, Elder Brother?!

187
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,062
Hey... You came back, Elder Brother!

188
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,636
Uh, Elder Brother?

189
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,772
What did you guys do to...
to Elder Brother?!

190
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,541
<i>I hijacked him! Idiot!</i>

191
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,188
<i>Wh What the heck...?!</i>

192
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:19,353
What?!

193
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:24,188
Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!

194
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,032
These guys!

195
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,770
Owww...!

196
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,505
Are you okay, Ino?

197
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,936
I I think I'm...

198
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,912
not okay! My gorgeous face is...!

199
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,546
Good grief... Gimme a break...

200
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:48,948
C Choji!

201
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,087
Choji!

202
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,615
Are you okay?!

203
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,556
I I'm fine...

204
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:00,259
Sorry... Feels like I fell asleep a little.

205
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,366
Hey, Elder Brother... You woke up.

206
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,670
<i>Damn. Can't be helped...</i>

207
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,706
<i>Guess I have no choice but to use</i>
<i>that thing.</i>

208
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,703
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

209
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:17,174
Elder Brother!

210
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,016
H-How dare you!

211
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:30,193
We're close. Mizuki may have
set a trap so be careful!

212
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:31,895
I know that!

213
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,933
It was so much fun to be behind bars...

214
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:50,037
The moldiness... The dampness...
The gloominess...

215
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,455
Pitch black year round!

216
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:04,259
But for that very reason that
I was able master techniques

217
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,662
that an ordinary Shinobi would
not be able to possess...

218
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,493
Even in this darkness...

219
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,797
I can get an intense sense
of your energy...

220
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:19,506
What's the matter?
Are you done already?

221
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,612
There's no time to be spaced out, Iruka.

222
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,253
I'm gonna take my time
and have fun with this...

223
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:30,754
Take my time, got it?

224
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,392
All right! Me too!

225
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:46,370
Wait! If you go in there right now
using Mind Transfer Jutsu,

226
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,531
my Jutsu will affect you too!

227
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:53,611
If you think you're the only one
who's learned a new Jutsu,

228
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,078
you're very wrong!

229
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,112
Ninja Art:

230
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:00,151
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

231
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,650
Wh What's the matter, Raijin?!

232
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:15,528
R-Raijin... What are you doing

233
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,792
Heh... Not bad...

234
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,799
"Ino collection,"
my new spring season Jutsu!

235
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,280
We're close!

236
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,245
That's it! That building!

237
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,755
All right! Just one last spurt!

238
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:59,734
How about it?
Have your eyes adjusted a little?

239
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,037
For guys like you who have lived
their lives in the light,

240
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,242
darkness is an inconvenience, isn't it?

241
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:13,989
Damn! Where are you?!

242
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,201
Hey, Iruka, weren't you saying that

243
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,239
you were going to bring this
to an end?

244
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,242
I see! By end,

245
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,677
you must have been
talking about yourself, huh?!

246
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:44,613
Heh! Just a little bit!

247
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,357
Hang in there, Ino!

248
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:47,414
Leave it to me!

249
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,553
Damn...!

250
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:59,028
Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!

251
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:01,167
Th Those jerks...

252
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,443
I I can't hold them any longer!

253
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:13,378
<i>If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now,</i>
<i>everything will go to waste...</i>

254
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,949
<i>Think... Think about the next move...</i>

255
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,357
Bear with it, Ino!

256
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:24,593
Leave it to me!

257
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,926
You're just gonna be
sent flying again!

258
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,327
Ino, just be quiet and watch!

259
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,033
Even the big-boned guy can make
quite a showing once he decides to do it!

260
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:40,338
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

261
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:42,104
Both Hands!

262
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,351
Choji...

263
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:55,457
I can't let just Ino get
all the good parts!

264
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,355
I'm the number one handsome
Big Boned Ninja!

265
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,997
Good work, Choji! You're so cool!

266
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,429
Huh... That Choji...

267
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:11,436
New Formation!
Ino Shika Cho completed!

268
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:19,776
<i>It's strange...</i>

269
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,976
<i>Any hint of Mizuki in the air</i>
<i>has vanished...</i>

270
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,479
<i>It's too quiet...</i>

271
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,065
<i>That's not it...</i>

272
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,433
<i>Even deeper...</i>

273
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,210
<i>Footsteps? No... It's not...</i>

274
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>It's different from the sound</i>
<i>of footsteps...</i>

275
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:34,482
<i>Finer and smaller...</i>

276
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:36,117
<i>Continuous...</i>

277
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:38,026
<i>sound.</i>

278
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,328
<i>Paper Bombs?!</i>

279
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,608
Wh What is that...?!

280
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:07,447
Wh What happened here?!

281
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,486
Iruka Sensei?!

282
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,853
Iruka Sensei!

283
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:32,379
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

284
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:35,852
<i>And you become speechless</i>

285
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,851
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

286
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:45,090
<i>So you don't answer</i>

287
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:50,793
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

288
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,670
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

289
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,175
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

290
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:07,379
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

291
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:16,986
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

292
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:26,164
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

293
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:37,976
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

294
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:54,596
No way! What happened to
Iruka Sensei?!

295
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:56,797
The scent ends here.

296
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,197
In any case,
we just have to search the perimeter.

297
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:02,371
Everything is in pieces. Damn it!

298
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,033
Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!

299
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,041
Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!

300
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:08,903
We have a company.

301
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,071
It seems someone is after us.

302
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:14,974
Next episode: "Orochimaru's Shadow!"
