1
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:17,218
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:21,814
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:26,654
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:29,925
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,131
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:40,506
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:45,880
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:49,475
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,853
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,856
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,924 --> 00:01:00,224
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,693
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:08,566
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:12,307
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,639
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,511
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,776
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,318
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:27,753
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:47,465
<i>Orochimaru's Shadow</i>

21
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:59,486
No way... What happened
to Iruka Sensei?

22
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:02,422
Iruka's scent ends right here...

23
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,849
In any case,
all we can do is search for him.

24
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:09,594
Damn it. Where's Iruka Sensei?!

25
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,531
Iruka Sensei!

26
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,506
What a relief!

27
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:23,669
You're safe!

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,304
Somehow...

29
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:31,118
Damn... that Mizuki...

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,314
Iruka Sensei...

31
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:34,813
That injury...

32
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:37,992
Huh, this injury is nothing...

33
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,017
Iruka Sensei!

34
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,959
I'm all right...
I just had a little rush of pain...

35
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:47,533
Somebody's approaching!

36
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,807
What a relief
the wound's not deep.

37
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,214
Yes...

38
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,452
The atmosphere feels kind of heavy...

39
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:09,721
Hmm... There must be something
between those two...

40
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,385
Well, what I think is...

41
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:16,087
What's up with the paw pad?

42
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,791
Idiot! Look carefully!
The little finger, the little finger!

43
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:22,936
Little finger? Huh?!
Iruka Sensei's?

44
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,435
Well, my intuition tells me
that it's positive...

45
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,835
Naruto, what are you two
talking about?

46
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,609
Uh, nothing!

47
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,309
Huh? Let me make an introduction.

48
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,409
This is Tsubaki...
Mizuki's fiance.

49
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,320
Fiance? Mizuki's?

50
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:43,857
Ah, it's negative...

51
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,323
What's up with that reaction?!

52
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:49,020
Mizuki has caused problems
for you again...

53
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:52,026
I sincerely apologize for that.

54
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:57,168
So you know about
Mizuki's prison break...?

55
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:00,537
Yes...

56
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,274
He came by my house once...

57
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,114
I became aware of that immediately
and tried to stop him.

58
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:13,345
But ultimately the result
was that I allowed him to go...

59
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:18,584
It really couldn't be helped
in light of the situation...

60
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:23,091
No. I should have tried
even harder to stop him.

61
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,590
But I...

62
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:42,150
Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!

63
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,451
Please take me with you!

64
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:48,250
Tsubaki...

65
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:51,557
I understand that I'm making
an impossible request!

66
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,824
But I want to stop him,
no matter what!

67
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,256
Iruka Sensei!

68
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:02,895
Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.

69
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:04,634
In that case...

70
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,605
I'm sorry, but I cannot allow that.

71
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,341
But why?

72
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,879
Why can't she?!

73
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:19,678
Naruto, we must hurry up
and search for Mizuki!

74
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,620
If she's with us,
she'll interfere with our mission!

75
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:26,026
But... But!

76
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:30,931
Iruka... If that's the case,
I think I'll be of service to you.

77
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,801
I have an idea of
where he might be heading!

78
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,805
Is that true, Tsubaki?!

79
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,575
There's probably no mistake...

80
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,042
But...

81
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,472
I beg you!

82
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:47,514
I think it's certain

83
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:50,449
that he'll use various tricks to camouflage
his tracks as he flees...

84
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,749
If we spend time on that...
it will all be too late!

85
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,491
Please take me with you!

86
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,152
Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23...

87
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,846
Huh, what was the result?

88
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,851
The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage...

89
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:29,715
Huh?! Who are you!

90
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,355
Dragon, Rooster, Dog...

91
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,976
The lookouts have been taken down!

92
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,445
It's an intruder!

93
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,389
What?!

94
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:13,059
The Nara Clan's research lab
was attacked?!

95
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:18,231
Yes... I just received a dispatch
from the Nara Clan...

96
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,299
According to the dispatch,

97
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,276
the insurgent's physical characteristics
match those of Mizuki.

98
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:24,577
Mizuki's...?

99
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,009
Yes!

100
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,577
<i>What is that Naruto doing?</i>

101
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:35,053
But it's something to have come up
with the idea of the Nara Clan's institute...

102
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:38,149
Notwithstanding the abundance of
narcotic substances that are stored there,

103
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,956
due to its remote mountain location,
security is comparatively lax.

104
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,459
And what substances were stolen?

105
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,501
Well... Because of their thorough control
of the substances,

106
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,630
they were able to determine immediately
which substances were taken...

107
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:57,076
So the description matched
after all, huh...

108
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:02,306
<i>But even if a mere Chunin were</i>
<i>to remove those narcotic substances</i>

109
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,578
<i>what would he be able</i>
<i>to do with them?</i>

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,650
Oh... Thank you. You may go now...

111
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:10,482
Yes ma'am!

112
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:19,026
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>I can't take any chances...</i>

113
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:22,727
<i>There's nothing I can do if</i>
<i>I don't know what his objective is.</i>

114
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:26,206
<i>If I can't discern that from</i>
<i>the actual materials...</i>

115
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>there may still be some means...</i>

116
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,373
<i>Perhaps the proportions</i>
<i>of the formula,</i>

117
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,539
<i>or possibly the order</i>
<i>in which they're blended...</i>

118
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,579
There's no mistake that
it's this direction, right?

119
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,749
Yes... Please continue to
proceed just like this.

120
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:48,289
Tsubaki, you said
"It will all be too late."

121
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,631
But do you know what
his objective is?

122
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,493
Probably... Although maybe not totally.

123
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:57,765
Tsubaki, please tell us!

124
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,807
In the past, he told me...

125
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:06,870
"I will get my hands on Orochimaru's power
and go to where Orochimaru is."

126
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,441
What was that?!

127
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,182
The reason he stole
the Scroll of Sealing

128
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:18,555
was simply because
he had chosen it as a hospitality gift...

129
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:23,625
Tsubaki... You knew that?

130
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,227
I didn't convey it to the village...

131
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:30,370
Just removing the Scroll of Sealing
is a serious felony...

132
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:33,734
And moreover, I was scared for
what'd happen

133
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:36,072
if his real objective
had come to light...

134
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:39,904
I believed that he would
mend his ways.

135
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,679
In that case you cannot avoid
retribution either.

136
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,618
I am prepared for it.

137
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,247
I thought it was strange...

138
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,720
If you knew where Mizuki was going,

139
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,352
you should have pursued him alone
in the first place.

140
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,755
But you...

141
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:01,224
I may not be able to stop him alone...

142
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,404
I want to stop him at any cost...

143
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,908
I don't want him to commit
any more crimes.

144
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,139
Unbelievable!

145
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:15,612
That Orochimaru...
So this was his plan!

146
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:22,247
However, could an ordinary Ninja
really manage to do this...?

147
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,722
It's something only within

148
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,555
the realm of an ex. Perienced
artisan's technique...

149
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,429
I'm busy!

150
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,230
I have a progress report on
the inmate prison break incident!

151
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,502
All right... Enter!

152
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:38,501
Yes, ma'am!

153
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,339
We have just finished
recapturing all inmates

154
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:49,941
with the exception of three -
Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.

155
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:51,147
Good work...

156
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:55,050
We are now continuing to investigate
the other three...

157
00:10:55,323 --> 00:11:01,159
But, the last inmate we captured said
something that concerned me...

158
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,188
Something that concerned you?

159
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,763
Yes... He apparently saw the three of
them fleeing together...

160
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,837
Fujin and Raijin were fleeing
with Mizuki?!

161
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:15,805
Damn it!

162
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,079
Lady Tsunade?

163
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:21,576
I'm going out!

164
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,644
Where are you going?

165
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:24,884
There's no need for you to come...

166
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,051
If what he said is true,

167
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,052
the guys I sent out won't be able
to deal with the situation alone...

168
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,605
Hey, Shikamaru...
If things continue like this...

169
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,736
we'll be in trouble!

170
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,342
We're already in trouble...

171
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:55,850
Shikamaru... All the Chakra is...

172
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,476
I know that...

173
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:01,945
I've thought of several methods,

174
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:06,384
but if I let go of these guys we are
gonna find ourselves in trouble...

175
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,692
You insolent jerk!

176
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,058
Having said that,

177
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,792
I can't take them down simply
by catching them,

178
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,299
so that's why I'm doing this...

179
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,565
I won't let you leave here alive!

180
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,272
These guys have monstrous stamina...

181
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:20,772
And what's more,

182
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,072
although their bodies
look like rubber at first glance,

183
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:26,045
with that much muscle strength
their instantaneous reflex. Es

184
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:27,581
are probably quite something too...

185
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:29,708
In other words,

186
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:32,446
you're saying that this is
the only possible method...

187
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,879
Let's do our best, everyone!

188
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:36,347
Sorry about this...

189
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,276
What do you think, Mizuki?

190
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:12,020
It's no good...
It's unfortunate but, he can no longer...

191
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:16,327
I see...
All right! Let's withdraw!

192
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,361
Hurry up!

193
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,557
Yeah...

194
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,005
It's unfortunate but...

195
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:28,338
guys who are of no use
on the battleground

196
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,206
only become a ball and chain...

197
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,504
Even though it's just a minor injury,

198
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,571
you won't be able to move
from this place, can you?

199
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,384
<i>Who's that?!</i>

200
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,927
<i>Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!</i>

201
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,321
I saw that...

202
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,663
No way... This can't be, you're...

203
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,298
Orochimaru?!

204
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,675
You are correct...

205
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,947
This can't be...
Why are you here?

206
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,006
Your whereabouts are supposed
to be unknown!

207
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,151
It doesn't matter why...

208
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:13,718
More importantly,

209
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,723
I witnessed something
very interesting earlier on...

210
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,759
You took the life of
an injured comrade, didn't you?

211
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,219
You saw that...?

212
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,190
That piqued my interest...

213
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,698
That's not a sight one sees
very often among the Leaf Shinobi

214
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,400
who devote their entire time
to playing house in the village...

215
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,539
So what are you trying to say?!

216
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:40,905
I didn't do anything wrong!
I had no choice but to do what I did!

217
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:44,877
You're a short tempered child,
aren't you...?

218
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:50,555
I'm not reproaching you.
You were just carrying out your mission.

219
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,123
That's right...

220
00:14:53,795 --> 00:15:00,826
But... Is there anybody in
the Leaf V illage who acknowledges you?

221
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,068
What did you just do?!

222
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,875
What in the world is this...?

223
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,515
This is my present to you...

224
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,889
Go visit that place if you feel like it.

225
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,006
<i>Here it is...</i>

226
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:42,099
<i>Looks like there hasn't been</i>
<i>a trespasser here before me...</i>

227
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:50,407
<i>The eighth one on the right...</i>

228
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:10,825
What's happening?

229
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,356
What is that power of
Orochimaru's anyway?

230
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,285
I don't know either.

231
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,326
And I don't know when
he encountered Orochimaru either...

232
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,394
But I'm positive that the answer to
those questions is waiting just up ahead!

233
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,802
That Scroll of Sealing incident...

234
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,674
You must be angry about it,
aren't you, Naruto?

235
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,203
I don't care about that in
the least anymore...

236
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:04,378
Because I repaid my debt to that
jerk Mizuki right there and then.

237
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:05,715
But...

238
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:06,983
But?

239
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:10,148
If that guy is still connected
to Orochimaru,

240
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,624
I need to ask him about something!

241
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:17,027
Because there's someone
I need to find at any cost!

242
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,026
<i>Sasuke...!</i>

243
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,174
It's up there...

244
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,242
All right!

245
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,193
That's everything...

246
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:13,353
With this all...

247
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,556
This will...

248
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:21,061
This will make me perfect!

249
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,824
This place is...

250
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,566
That guy has done something...

251
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,771
That smell gives me the shivers...

252
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,332
Smell?

253
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,306
I was wondering who that was...

254
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:43,045
You guys are really persistent,
aren't you?

255
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,018
Well, this is very convenient.

256
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:49,456
Because I was intending to take
you guys down anyway.

257
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:51,224
Mizuki...

258
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,257
You jerk!

259
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,455
Mizuki... Your ambitions end here!

260
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:01,092
Impudent as always, huh...
However, you're too late!

261
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,735
Just like you always are...

262
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,430
What is that?

263
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:08,205
Beautiful, don't you think?

264
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,369
Damn it!

265
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:21,052
You guys... should feel honored
to be my first prey...

266
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,130
What?!

267
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,165
That's... almost like...

268
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:40,902
<i>But that's they way it is,</i>
<i>isn't it, Naruto... ?

269
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,017
<i>It's true, you were actually special.</i>

270
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,088
<i>But...</i>

271
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,991
Then that's...

272
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,323
Orochimaru's power!

273
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:08,497
Mizuki...

274
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,055
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

275
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,528
<i>And you become speechless</i>

276
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:42,528
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

277
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,766
<i>So you don't answer</i>

278
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:51,469
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

279
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:56,346
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

280
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,851
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

281
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:08,055
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

282
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:17,663
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

283
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:26,840
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

284
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:38,652
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

285
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:53,671
That's what you meant by
the "invincible body?

286
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:56,809
No matter how much strength
you gain,

287
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:01,541
the kind of strength dependant
on drugs can never be a true strength!

288
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:07,080
Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says!
Orochimaru's Drug?

289
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:11,825
I'll crush that kind of nonsense,
so be prepared!

290
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:16,186

You Can't Bring Me Down!"
