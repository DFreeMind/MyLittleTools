1
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:21,938
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:26,748
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,380
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,981
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,586
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:46,504
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:55,875
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:06,657
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:16,133
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,263
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:57,604
Hey, Akamaru!

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,674
Wait up, Akamaru.

13
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:10,589
Akamaru!

14
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,150
Naruto... Umm...

15
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:20,763
I made you a box lunch.
Eat it if you like.

16
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,328
Oh, thanks.

17
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,166
Wh What's this?

18
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:36,404
What the heck's the idea, you guys...?
This isn't a picnic.

19
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,381
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:40,378
Come on, it's okay, right?

21
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:43,645
A cinch mission just
the three of us can manage.

22
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,853
You yourself said
you weren't fired up, right?

23
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,827
I'm not fired up!

24
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,967
It's a mission to catch a petty thief.

25
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:58,466
It'd be the same no matter
who went on the mission.

26
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:01,005
Look. Under normal circumstances,

27
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,975
a three man team of Kiba, Hinata
and Shino would be fundamental.

28
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,778
But unfortunately, Shino is absent
as he's off on a different mission.

29
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,348
It'd be better if even you were there
than not, right?

30
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,817
What, Old Lady?!
That's taking it too far!

31
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:16,718
I'll do my best.

32
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,621
This is a mission I kind of
can't get into, though.

33
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,921
There's probably no need to take
the trouble to determine a troop leader.

34
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:30,430
Anyway, your mission is
to capture the man who stole...

35
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,971
the Misogi tea jar owned by
the feudal lord of the Land of Tea.

36
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,867
This man, Gosunkugi.

37
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:40,203
According to sources,
he's now hiding in the Land of Stone.

38
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,077
Get over there lickety split
and catch him lickety split.

39
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:49,387
Hearing that makes me feel
less fired up than ever.

40
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,315
Here, Akamaru.

41
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:00,064
Well, missions like this are okay
once in a while, right?

42
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,795
Let's take it easy.

43
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,332
It's a cinch mission, so all the more reason
I want to finish it up quick.

44
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:08,670
What'll happen if the Pervy Sage
comes back while I'm gone?

45
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,433
I'm sorry, Naruto.

46
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,574
I... um, I was so happy to be
on a mission... with you.

47
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,817
Huh? What did you say, Hinata?
I can't hear you.

48
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,989
What're you blushing for?
You're a weird one.

49
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,853
Well, hold your horses... Look.

50
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,190
We'll be in the Land of Stone
once we cross that mountain pass.

51
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,865
Be sure to fortify yourself
with food by then.

52
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:43,242
It's kind of complicated
when it's like eating myself.

53
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,338
Hey, this is good!

54
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:49,915
Hinata, you'd make a great wife!

55
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:51,081
What?

56
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,346
<i>Wife... ?

57
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,260
Land of Stone

58
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:23,873
This is the first post station
of the Land of Stone.

59
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:27,208
Doesn't it look... kind of rough?

60
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,366
<i>The Bounty Hunter</i>
<i>from the Wilderness</i>

61
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,353
What're these guys doing...
staring like that?

62
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,395
This doesn't feel like
we'll be able to do this lickety split.

63
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,533
What is it, Akamaru?

64
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:30,073
Could it be that Gosunkugi guy
is among them?

65
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,379
Got you, Gosunkugi!

66
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:42,525
It's a photo.

67
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,657
What, this is Gosunkugi, isn't it?

68
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,159
Three million ryo?

69
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,031
What's the meaning of this?

70
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,967
Look... They're hanging over there,
and here, too.

71
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,140
All right, I'll try asking someone.

72
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,209
Asia Saloon

73
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,184
Hello!

74
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,949
Can I help you?

75
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:17,456
I have something I'd like to ask you.

76
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,123
What, if you're not a customer, beat it.

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,369
Then I'll order something...
I'll have ramen.

78
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:27,166
I'll have a hamburger steak with cheese.
He'll have milk.

79
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:34,505
This is funny. Milk?
Hamburger steak with cheese?

80
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,739
And ramen on top of that?

81
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,449
Are you making a fool of me?
Get out, brats!

82
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,687
If it's the money, we have some.

83
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,256
That's not the issue.

84
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:51,621
Oh... It's dangerous for kids
to carry such a large amount of money...

85
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,765
I'll take charge of it for you.

86
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,992
After all, there are lots of bad men
in this town.

87
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,164
Hey, what're you doing?
Are you still in?

88
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:04,001
Oh, just a minute.
I got the money. I'll be right over.

89
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:07,512
Huh? What's with you?
Hey, let go!

90
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,208
You're the one who'll let go.

91
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,616
How about that?

92
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,681
You brat... You want to fight?!

93
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,719
That's the plan... Bring it!

94
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,655
You punk!

95
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,023
Hold it, Naruto.

96
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:26,855
Naruto, look around.

97
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,239
This is bad.

98
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,142
Master, milk.

99
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:39,939
Who the hell are you?

100
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,348
O Okay, coming right up!

101
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:47,782
Here you are.

102
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:48,881
Thanks.

103
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:53,085
Now, no need to hesitate.
Drink up.

104
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:56,624
It's a treat from
old billiard ball head over there.

105
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:02,731
"Billiard -ball head" means me?
Knock it off, you jerk!

106
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:05,069
Who would treat some puppy milk?

107
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,130
You want to get killed?!

108
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:23,647
Bounty, Michizo Manaka.

109
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,519
You can take the credit, Master.

110
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:30,325
Take the money for the milk
from his bounty...

111
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:35,861
And the money to repair the table, too.
I don't need change.

112
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,130
He's strong.

113
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,832
Are you in the same trade as I am?
Sorry about that.

114
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,708
Wait!

115
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,152
Something you want?

116
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,781
Who the heck are you, old man?

117
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:58,854
<i>"Old man," you say?</i>

118
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:03,093
I'm Sazanami, a bounty hunter.

119
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,565
How cool!

120
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:09,362
Old man!

121
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:14,197
Say, say...
That thing earlier was cool.

122
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,474
Hm? The iai-nuki?

123
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:20,737
It was so fast I couldn't see when
you drew your sword.

124
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,738
It was really surprising...

125
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:27,041
I bet that's what they mean
when they say "In a blink of an eye."

126
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,312
Life and death is on the line
for us bounty hunters...

127
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,982
No matter how many lives we can have,
it wouldn't be enough

128
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,756
if we couldn't draw our sword
faster than others.

129
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,997
Say, say! Say, say!
What's a bounty hunter?

130
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,331
Let's see...

131
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,901
There are people who offer a bounty
in order to capture bad guys.

132
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:52,401
And a bounty hunter catches
those bad guys and receives the bounty.

133
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,075
Hmm.

134
00:10:55,247 --> 00:11:00,082
Then this guy has
a bounty on him, right?

135
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,782
Boy, that's...

136
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,981
Why's there so much money on his head?

137
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:08,060
This guy's just a simple thief...

138
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:10,295
A simple thief, you say?

139
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,926
Boy, this guy's a super A-rank bounty

140
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,526
who has killed dozens of people
for the sake of stealing.

141
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:18,303
What?!

142
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,735
No way.

143
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,163
Say what?

144
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,074
What's the meaning of this?
I haven't heard about that.

145
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,708
The feudal lord who commissioned
this mission

146
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,714
might not have known about that.

147
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,644
Mission?

148
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,550
Yeah. We're Hidden Leaf Ninja

149
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,283
and we came to this town
to capture Gosunkugi.

150
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,149
<i>Leaf?</i>

151
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,659
So you're Ninja, huh?

152
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,822
This is interesting.

153
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:52,562
So even kids like this
are qualified to be Ninja?

154
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:55,399
What?! Don't make fun of us!

155
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,309
Well, don't get so mad.
Sorry about that...

156
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:01,872
I'll treat you guys to something. Milk?

157
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,312
We're not Akamaru.
I want ramen!

158
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,686
Then I'll have a hamburger steak
with cheese.

159
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:11,621
I I I guess I'll have ramen, too.

160
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,820
Okay. Come with me.

161
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:19,097
<i>Jeez, no way would there be</i>
<i>ramen in a bar.</i>

162
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,793
Hey, old man. Would even miso ramen
topped with pork be okay?

163
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,393
Sure, have anything you like.

164
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:40,913
What is this? We're rapidly moving away
from town.

165
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,385
I don't see a ramen shop anywhere.

166
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:49,725
Now then...

167
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:00,672
I don't see any ramen shops.

168
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,805
So what I said earlier about treating
you guys is canceled.

169
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:08,640
Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.

170
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:10,743
O Old man...

171
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:26,229
You guys are going to die here.

172
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,728
Hey, old man... What's the idea?

173
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:34,538
To think you guys would know
that Gosunkugi is in this town.

174
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,438
So what if we do know?

175
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:43,714
Gosunkugi is my prey...
I can't hand him over to you.

176
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,846
Knock it off!
You should just go get him yourself.

177
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,280
No, even if you guys are kids,

178
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:54,349
it's a different story when it comes
to Leaf Ninjas.

179
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,330
It's better to have fewer...
wait, no competitors.

180
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:01,597
Old man.

181
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:04,632
Here I go.

182
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:12,668
Hinata!

183
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,070
That's dirty!

184
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:15,877
Naruto!

185
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,975
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All Four Jutsu!

186
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:21,416
Interesting.

187
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:23,881
Bring it.

188
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,853
I won't lose at speed!

189
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,027
Damn it! Where are you?

190
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,434
Too slow.

191
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:46,175
Boy...

192
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:49,310
Now you're the last one.

193
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,507
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

194
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:58,320
Oh...

195
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,522
I won't let you do as you please!

196
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:14,770
Over here!

197
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,079
<i>You're mine.</i>

198
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,784
Almost.

199
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,552
Forgive me, boy.

200
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,355
I'll be the one to defeat him,
no matter what.

201
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,360
Akamaru.

202
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,965
Damn it! He got us good.

203
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,564
Hinata, you okay?

204
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:20,136
Y Yeah.

205
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:22,603
Where's Sazanami?

206
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,805
Could it be he went after Gosunkugi?

207
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,246
I can't just sit here like this!
He'll beat us to the draw.

208
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,983
Damn it! Where <i>is</i> that old man?

209
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,390
Did he leave town?

210
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,459
Going after Gosunkugi?

211
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,370
Akamaru, we're counting on you!

212
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:28,171
The most crucial treasure is missing here.

213
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,098
Filthy hyena.

214
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,546
I waited a long time for you
to make your move.

215
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,554
Unfortunately, I have
an important job to do.

216
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:50,423
Time is valuable.
I'll get right to taking care of you.

217
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,532
Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.

218
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:08,139
Gosunkugi, here I come!

219
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,852
You can't move anymore.

220
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,229
It's over.

221
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,300
Finish him.

222
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,772
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

223
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:41,375
Gosunkugi, you're under arrest!

224
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,146
Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?

225
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,487
Retreat!

226
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:52,255
I won't let you get away!

227
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:53,954
Wait.

228
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,620
Boy...

229
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,088
You must not go.

230
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:06,795
Old man!

231
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:09,667
H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.

232
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,579
Stay away from him.
He's too much for you guys.

233
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,266
How could such a strong guy be beaten?

234
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:40,535
Gosunkugi isn't a mere thief.

235
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,907
He's a Shinobi, same as us.

236
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,902
Shinobi.

237
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,220
Sazanami!

238
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,936
Is this one of Gosunkugi's comrades?

239
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:19,737
You! As I recall,
you were in the bar before...

240
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:21,301
Damn!

241
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,779
Who was that guy?

242
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,377
Hm, what?

243
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,450
A wanted flyer.

244
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,424
Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?

245
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,627
No, that's not it.

246
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,725
"This man who calls himself Tokichi
is a major criminal

247
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:48,331
who has killed a family of three..."

248
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,871
"He has a bird shaped birthmark
on his chest."

249
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,179
A bird shaped birthmark...?
It couldn't be...

250
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,404
What is it, Hinata?

251
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,479
I can't tell because
his face is covered with scars...

252
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:04,051
But he has... a bird -shaped birthmark!

253
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:06,116
Oh!

254
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,892
He has a bounty on his head, too?

255
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:13,560
What the heck is going on
with everything?

256
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:41,920
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

257
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:53,497
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

258
00:21:54,239 --> 00:22:04,808
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

259
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:16,993
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

260
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:28,437
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

261
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:39,982
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

262
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:45,747
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

263
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:54,930
A long, long time ago just recently,
on an overcast clear day...

264
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,829
It was night since morning.

265
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:01,095
The righteous rogue Sazanami's
string of his past unwinds and frays.

266
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,741
Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!

267
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,776
Although the situation is
now clear to me,

268
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,835
there are times when
a Shinobi cannot back out!

269
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,810
Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!

270
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:12,247
Give it up and submit to arrest!

271
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:16,285
Next time: "Hunt or Be Hunted?!
Showdown at the OK Temple"
