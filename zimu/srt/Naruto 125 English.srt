1
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:20,963
<i>Connecting old words</i>
<i>that have been used up</i>

2
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:29,705
<i>I just want to convey</i>
<i>my simple thoughts</i>

3
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:35,143
<i>That day's faint wind blows away</i>

4
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:39,273
<i>at the castle ruins of yesterday</i>

5
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>I'll laugh with you</i>
<i>and live for the moment</i>

6
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:53,062
<i>Still that incident</i>
<i>will continue to trouble you, right?</i>

7
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:57,956
<i>That's why it must be good bye</i>

8
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:04,941
<i>Leaving nothing behind,</i>
<i>let us share what is left</i>

9
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:12,140
<i>In time, we'll realize</i>
<i>that it was everything</i>

10
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:18,882
<i>And sadness will touch our cheeks,</i>
<i>creating a river of tears</i>

11
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:28,857
<i>Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex</i>
<i>and melting away</i>

12
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,862
<i>The smell is moving away...</i>

13
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,973
I'm saved...

14
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:14,909
<i>Who is?</i>

15
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,847
Please wait!

16
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,221
The real deal... starts now!

17
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:40,760
<i>My role now is to stall this person</i>
<i>as long as possible...</i>

18
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:45,035
<i>so, I should've avoided big techniques</i>
<i>that could be self defeating...</i>

19
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,204
<i>But it seems this isn't an opponent</i>
<i>easy enough to beat</i>

20
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,076
<i>without using my Secret Technique...</i>

21
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,575
Here I go!

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,083
<i>I just had surgery</i>
<i>and am not at my best...</i>

23
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:03,684
<i>But if it'd just be opening the first of the</i>
<i>Eight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,</i>

24
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:04,658
<i>I should somehow...</i>

25
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,962
The first gate... The Gate of Opening...

26
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:12,224
Open!

27
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,139
Primary Lotus!

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,778
<i>The impact of the kick</i>
<i>was suppressed by the bones... ?!</i>

29
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:31,481
That's some speed... But it's over.

30
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:37,687
<i>Damn it... No matter how much I think,</i>
<i>I can't come up with any good strategies...!</i>

31
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:42,863
<i>I've had it...can't hold any further...</i>

32
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:49,201
With me right in front of you,
you can't even howl like a loser...?

33
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,001
Huh?!

34
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:53,304
Die!

35
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:55,804
You're mine!

36
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:59,204
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!

37
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,426
What?!

38
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,235
Who're you?!

39
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,241
It seems you're an ally this time...

40
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,486
Who're you?!

41
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,517
A Sand...

42
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:43,652
Shinobi...

43
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,651
ally of the Leaf!

44
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:55,871
<i>The Sand Shinobi.</i>
<i>Allies of the Leaf</i>

45
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:14,282
<i>The Sand...?! Am I still drunk...?</i>

46
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,038
Gaara of the Desert...

47
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,441
Gaara.

48
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,775
Is that who you are?

49
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,716
Digital Shrapnel!

50
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:14,514
<i>Did he blow the finger tip bones... ?!</i>

51
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,821
Impetuous...

52
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,794
You...

53
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:40,267
When you fought me...
you had more speed and sharpness.

54
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,575
Easy to say...

55
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:51,284
It's not that I'm holding a grudge...

56
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:56,456
But on account of you,
I had kind of a tough time of it.

57
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,596
I see...

58
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,162
But... why you?

59
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,867
I owe a lot...

60
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:17,346
to the Leaf.

61
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,449
Sasuke!

62
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:31,319
I heard that we'd made up
with the Sand traitors...

63
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,296
But to think you'd change
this abruptly...

64
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:38,664
It's not like we attacked the Leaf
for the fun of it...

65
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,035
It was an order...

66
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,635
In the same way
that I'm here now.

67
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,840
<i>I see. The Fifth Hokage</i>
<i>asked the Sand...</i>

68
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,543
<i>It's a big help.</i>

69
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:57,243
By the way...
has your sharpness gotten worse?

70
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,248
Huh?

71
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,858
Are you going to give up again
or something?

72
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:08,527
This time, <i>I'll</i> do it for you!

73
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,957
Sorry, but I can't give up.

74
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,436
A man mustn't be protected
by a woman, so...

75
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,906
As usual, you're a guy who's annoying
with the man and woman stuff.

76
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,277
Even if you act tough, it's totally obvious
that it's bravado, you idiot!

77
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,315
This time you're taking sides
with the Leaf, huh?!

78
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,053
You guys sure are busy
all over the place!

79
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,555
She uses Genjutsu
with the sound of her flute.

80
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:42,529
Right!

81
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,998
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

82
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,521
<i>Blowing away the sounds of the flute</i>

83
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,422
<i>and being able to nail the opponent</i>
<i>with a physical attack.</i>

84
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,718
<i>To think she can attack and defend</i>
<i>with one hand...</i>

85
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,491
<i>Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.</i>

86
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,708
<i>That woman's a natural enemy to me!</i>

87
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,702
Has Ukon... just about caught him
according to the strategy?

88
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,776
Puppet, huh?

89
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:13,615
You three had been approaching
together, right?

90
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,582
Two went on ahead.

91
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,756
You guys are weak, so...

92
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,462
You idiot... These guys are
out of the ordinary!

93
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:25,795
Behind you!

94
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,967
I can't... move.

95
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,536
What's this guy?

96
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:43,218
I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!

97
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,357
<i>Where's the other one?</i>

98
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:54,555
Hey! Who are you looking for?

99
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,056
<i>That state... I know!</i>

100
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:03,033
Be careful!
They enter the body and start to fuse!

101
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,037
It's too late.

102
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,075
This guy!

103
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,056
What's the matter, Sakon?!

104
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,606
It seems like...

105
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,776
your Jutsu didn't work...
on the puppet.

106
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:50,983
<i>This is a puppet, too?!</i>

107
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:56,282
Let me tell you this.

108
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:00,591
We, the Sand Ninja,
aren't as lax as the Leaf.

109
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:04,993
Moreover, don't be carelessly
approaching...

110
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:11,034
the Black Ant!

111
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,506
<i>He was fearsome</i>
<i>when he was an enemy...</i>

112
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,744
<i>But to think he'd be this dependable</i>
<i>when becoming an ally.</i>

113
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:06,154
Ow... I got careless.
Let me rest in your body for a bit.

114
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,224
Good for nothing guy...

115
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,492
Who are these guys?

116
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,630
This is their ability!

117
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,899
Although you were caught off guard...

118
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,872
you getting hammered
by that puppet play...

119
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:20,539
Well...

120
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:24,475
Its power and speed
are nothing special.

121
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:27,414
I won't be beaten
by the likes of such a toy.

122
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,959
And I was able
to heal my belly wound.

123
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,287
I don't have much Chakra left...
but well,

124
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:46,631
these are opponents I should be able
to tear apart, nevertheless.

125
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,871
<i>Indeed, it seems he's healed.</i>
<i>What a recovery ability he's got.</i>

126
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,475
Ordinarily, I'm not the one
who becomes the main body,

127
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,379
so it's hard to move, damn it.

128
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:03,543
You sure are mocking us...

129
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,352
He's not an opponent
you can beat fighting head on!

130
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,890
We should retreat for now and...

131
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,995
We can't back down after having been
mocked, you know.

132
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,465
Don't mess with me!

133
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:54,334
The Black Ant isn't a Mechanism
for attacking.

134
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:57,038
Primarily, it's just for capturing.

135
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:02,743
And... Crow paired up with the Black Ant
is exclusively for attacking.

136
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:08,748
Hey you! Let me out!

137
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:34,075
Eat this!

138
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:36,343
Puppet Show...

139
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,545
Hey, let me out! Let me out!

140
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,813
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

141
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,544
The play is over.

142
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,622
She hid, huh...?

143
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:26,823
Or did she run away?

144
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:29,627
No... That couldn't be...

145
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:34,536
I just got here.

146
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,767
Briefly explain the present situation

147
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,809
including an analysis of her ability
and battle style.

148
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:45,406
First off, her fundamental tactic is
ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu

149
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,039
with the sound of her flute.

150
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,444
And then she delivers physical attacks
to that opening.

151
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,712
<i>Demon Flute. Chains of Fantasia!</i>

152
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:05,166
This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?

153
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,306
I can't move my body...!

154
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,736
<i>I believe this was your last hand, right?</i>

155
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,608
<i>Unfortunately...</i>
<i>this is reversed checkmate!</i>

156
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,009
<i>You little rat!</i>

157
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,786
She's a classic Genjutsu style
distance range type.

158
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:30,922
Most likely, she must've seen your Jutsu
and figured out immediately

159
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,757
that it wouldn't mix well
with her own Jutsu.

160
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:35,792
And it's two against one, too.

161
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:40,625
She'll never appear before us again
until she casts her Genjutsu.

162
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,302
Sound, huh...?

163
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,198
Yeah...

164
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:50,073
Genjutsu generally appeal
to the five senses of people...

165
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:54,310
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.

166
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,550
The type that uses hearing
is the most troublesome of them all.

167
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:09,427
After she cleverly takes a distance on you
and then hides...

168
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:13,025
you have no idea where the Genjutsu
will be cast from or when.

169
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,700
The idea is for us to already be cast
by the Genjutsu

170
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,900
by the time we've figured out where she is
by the sound of the flute...

171
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:25,573
Ouch...

172
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,909
In my opinion, we're at an
overwhelming disadvantage.

173
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:36,048
<i>A battle with this type, essentially,</i>
<i>wouldn't even be worth talking about</i>

174
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,150
<i>without sensor types</i>
<i>like Kiba or Neji.</i>

175
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:43,693
At this rate, we'll get pushed into a corner
sooner or later.

176
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:47,429
- We should just retreat...
- Who asked for your opinion?!

177
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:51,869
I told you to just explain the situation.

178
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:57,738
Don't misjudge my power...

179
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,408
If she thinks
she's hiding well from me...

180
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:05,511
in a distance enough for the sound
of her flute to reach...

181
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,684
she's nave!

182
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:13,292
Summoning: Blade Dance

183
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:16,590
Cut!

184
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:27,606
<i>All right...</i>

185
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,369
<i>I've made it this far.</i>
<i>It's about time for my Genjutsu...</i>

186
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,243
Huh?

187
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:22,964
How about it?

188
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,091
It's done.

189
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,266
<i>She's sure...pushy.</i>

190
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:33,035
<i>She's scarier than my mom.</i>

191
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:36,341
Pretty good, huh?

192
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:39,114
<i>But well...</i>

193
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:43,246
<i>I just have to be grateful</i>
<i>for this time...huh?</i>

194
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,027
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

195
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:30,122
<i>And you smiled</i>

196
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,664
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

197
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:35,465
<i>In my own words</i>

198
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:41,101
<i>Would you think it was</i>
<i>a bother if I approached you?</i>

199
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:46,644
<i>Despite my doubts,</i>
<i>I worked up my courage</i>

200
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:52,320
<i>My clumsy attempts with words</i>

201
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:58,050
<i>You listened without turning away</i>

202
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:04,228
<i>No wonder I get carried away by you</i>

203
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:11,300
<i>But you don't feel anything for me, do you?</i>

204
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,503
<i>I feel so sad</i>

205
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:15,475
<i>But...</i>

206
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,944
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

207
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,982
<i>And you smiled</i>

208
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:23,710
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

209
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,778
<i>In my own words</i>

210
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:29,288
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

211
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:32,486
<i>And you smiled</i>

212
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,029
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

213
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:37,998
<i>In my own words</i>

214
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:42,627
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

215
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:54,649
I got careless earlier,
but it won't be like that now!

216
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:56,946
Now, you please stand back.

217
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:00,750
I'm grateful for the help,
but his opponent will be me!

218
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:03,120
Next, for sure,
with my ultimate Lotus...!

219
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:09,961
Hey, why are you moving forward?
I'm his opponent!

220
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:15,100
