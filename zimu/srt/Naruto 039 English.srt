The driven in ones more and more often come.

Sasuke-kun

18
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,060
 task that you would have to be withdrawn.

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,630
Eh?

20
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,300
From when six met to you
with strange Orochimaru six cos  .

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,760
-  Akadou Yoroi VS Uchiha Sasuke  -

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,650
Just just for first!

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,690
I did not ask better.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340
The challengers of the first encounter are

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,460
 Akadou Yoroy and Uchiha Sasuke.

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,060
There are objections?

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,410
-  Not!
-  Not!

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,740
The pain not if it goes some!

29
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,730
It seems that the Juin Jutsu makes it badly.

30
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,980
Not to use the Sharingan.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,150
Then you knew it.

32
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,930
If that sign on the neck began
to expand itself you would find yourself in life danger

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,810
Probable.

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,580
If it had to happen,
the encounter would come suspended

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,440
 and I would take part in order to stop to you.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,330
He would come Suspended!

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,620
This sign seems that
it reacts to my Chakra.

38
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,740
Therefore in this encounter

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,000
 other that Sharingan,  I will not be able
to use not even the normal techniques.

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,470
Moreover the power of Yoroi

41
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,060
.. how much is worse could capitare to you

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,130
 Sasuke-kun.

43
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,980
Well, begun also.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,860
Six you
That it steals the Chakra to me

45
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,970
Of six shrewed you only hour ?

46
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,150
Super Eyebrows Jealous!
Shishi Rendan!

47
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,180
Six you
That it steals the Chakra to me

48
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,450
Of six shrewed you only hour?

49
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,940
Already, the characteristic of Yoroi
it is to absorb the Chakra.

50
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,210
Its technique is narcotic

51
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,110
 from the ability to absorb
the energy of the enemy

52
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,520
 only touching it with the palm of the hand

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,690
 and once that your Chakra will be exausted

54
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:47,320
 you will become succube of my sign, Sasuke-kun.

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,590
Cos   freed

56
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,570
 sweet to be able.

57
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,560
E' your only one via of salvation!

58
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,110
Vattene!

59
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,800
You still have of the forces.

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,290
In any case six solo an unarmed animal.

61
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
There is lacked little.

62
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,070
Not to fear

63
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,240
 I will put  fastly fine to all.

64
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,300
Cos' you have?

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,870
You have already exausted all the energies?

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,220
It tries the body to body.
How I must act?

67
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,390
At this rate

68
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,540
 I will come  defeated.

69
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,310
Uchiha Sasuke

70
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,090
 all here?

71
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,040
Sasuke-kun!

72
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,430
Sasuke!!!

73
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,980
E' cos   that you carry the name of the Uchiha?

74
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,090
If it is cos   not to dare to make these figuracce!

75
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,370
You fight seriously!!

76
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,070
It is

77
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,010
I have understood!

78
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,290
You cannot allow you of distrarti.

79
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,740
Now we close the crash.

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Made E'?

81
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
E' scomparso?

82
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,090
But this is my technique.

83
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,480
What!

84
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,870
Even if

85
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,030
 from this point varying mine is one!

86
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,080
E' the end!!!

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,770
The Kage Buyou!

88
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,500
You take this!

89
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,960
Eternal damnation!

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,430
Just  hour cannot react!

91
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,450
I pray to you

92
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,330
I pray to you

93
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,650
 stopped!

94
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,150
Sasuke!!!

95
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,880
Not to dare to make these figuracce!

96
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,090
I did not think that I would have made them to worry!

97
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,800
E' to the limit?

98
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,150
I will not make myself

99
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,980
 to subject

100
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,750
 from this diavoleria!

101
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,280
The sign has been withdrawn?

102
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,830
You take this.

103
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,050
It underrates me!

104
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,150
Six you that it underrates it!

105
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,920
I have not still ended!

106
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,460
Shishi Rendan!

107
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,600
Not there is neanche need to control.

108
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,190
The crash ends here.

109
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,570
Consequently

110
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,400
 the winner of the first crash is Uchiha Sasuke!

111
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,790
He has exceeded the eliminatoria phase.

112
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,710
Made E'!

113
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,140
Beautiful job.

114
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,600
The technique of the Shishi Rendan
it was * taijutsu of Gai.
* Martial limbs

115
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,830
It must have them memorizza to you with the Sharingan
when it has faced Lee.

116
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,150
Sasuke!

117
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,020
Just you! Just you

118
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,220
 that you make one pessima Victoria!

119
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,440
Six pure all broken one!

120
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,360
* BAKA!
* (Stupid)

121
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,570
That idiot!

122
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,790
Sasuke-kun

123
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,100
 little evil!

124
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,320
I  will gain anch'!

125
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,080
Lee, is survivor thanks to you.

126
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,850
If you had not seen your blow they give near
ce I would not have made it.

127
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,020
But it does not seem one technical to often use.

128
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,290
I understand.

129
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,050
You have learned the blows that I have used
against of you that time.

130
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,330
Sharingan.

131
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,880
Dev' to be this your innata ability.

132
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,400
Sasuke-kun

133
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,020
.. a six great guerriero!

134
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,720
You will become more and more strong!

135
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,900
Your abilities scare to me.

136
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,240
The multiple blow is a taijutsu
to high speed

137
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,410
 and  it cannot  be executed
without a hard training.

138
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,860
It is not learned simply cos  

139
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,120
 neanche with the use of the Sharingan.

140
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,890
Without to count the improvisation
for that final technique.

141
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,950
Kakashi, this boy remembers me you

142
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,750
 from small!

143
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,300
The esordiente n.1 of the slid year was Hyuuga Neji.

144
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,380
This year seems that it is Uchiha Sasuke.

145
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,870
Who of the two will be strongest?

146
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,860
That boy

147
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,640
The Sharingan has taken advantage of
in one unfavorable situation.

148
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,630
The blood of the Uchiha is demonstrated
terrifying once again.

149
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,250
Impietrita Sono.

150
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,790
Successful E' to make to withdraw the sign
in espazione with the single force of will.

151
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,690
Eternal damnation Of new?

152
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,350
Well, otherwise we will not amuse ourselves.

153
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,020
Sasuke-kun is cos   Bravo!

154
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,700
It knows to me that we will stop ourselves here.

155
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,770
I have hunger!

156
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,340
Fantastic!

157
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,660
Nothing of special!

158
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,270
Magnificent!

159
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,350
Uchiha Sasuke

160
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,660
 we of the medical group
we will supply you the best cures.

161
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,220
It is not a problem that you can manage.

162
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,380
Uh?

163
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,800
I  of he will take care.

164
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,510
I will carry  to you  in the room on the back

165
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,110
 and I seal you the sign.

166
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,530
We can wait for the end of the combats?

167
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,230
I would want to see the encounter.

168
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,920
Not.

169
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,870
They give one to you calmed.

170
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,990
If we do not act to more soon,
you will suffer the most serious consequences.>.

171
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,950
I do not want more to feel your egoist demands.

172
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,830
Force you come.

173
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,860
Sasuke-kun

174
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,150
Sakura-chan

175
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,370
 you have not seen something like
one hurt on the neck of Sasuke?

176
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,920
You promise it to me.

177
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,160
Not to say nothing to naruto of this sign!

178
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,360
What?

179
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,440
It makes part of the square job.

180
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,900
It would be stupid causargli
useless worries!

181
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,170
I would not know!

182
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,830
I understand.

183
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,610
Hour

184
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,340
 we begin the next encounter!

185
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,980
-  Zaku Abumi VS Aburame Shino  -

186
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,050
Who is the other amateur?

187
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,590
The combatants make themselves ahead.

188
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,660
Well.

189
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,390
Then we begin according to encounter.

190
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,780
It is the ninja of the sound

191
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,480
 to which Sasuke-kun he has broken the arm.

192
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,660
It seems proud of yours

193
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,060
 arms.

194
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,710
Stopped!!!

195
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,570
It fights in this state?

196
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,310
Shino-kun ce will make it?

197
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,090
Sure! Shino is strong!

198
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,860
Eh?

199
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,100
E' the only one that I would not want to defy.

200
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,050
Begun!

201
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,410
It will be interesting

202
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,220
 to see as you will fight, Zaku.

203
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,580
If you will fight now, you will not be able
more to carry out the activity of the ninja.

204
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,910
Renunciation!

205
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,380
I succeed to move po' an arm.

206
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,810
 and for as you he is more than sufficient!

207
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,520
You will not succeed to strike to me with a single arm.

208
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,820
You make Hush!

209
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,470
You take this!

210
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,540
* Zankuuha!
* (cutting wave)

211
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,620
Well!

212
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,600
You still resist a moment.

213
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,050
I have nearly ended.

214
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,670
Fuuja Houin!
(Suppressor of the Evil!)

215
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,230
Even if that sign had to react of new

216
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,990
 this I seal would have to block!

217
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,710
However

218
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:13,360
 I seal depends very
from your will.

219
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,150
If you lose the confidence in you
and your will wavers

220
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,970
 the sign will be expanded of new!

221
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,890
It seems sfinito!

222
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,680
Now you succeed also to use seals.

223
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,730
Six improved, Kakashi.

224
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,280
You six

225
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,040
It is passed some of time, Kakashi-kun.

226
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,900
Orochimaru!

227
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,270

228
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:18,440

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:27,580
