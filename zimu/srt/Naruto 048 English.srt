2
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,974
Hey, loser!

3
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,586
I will warn you about two things...

4
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:41,870
If you are a real ninja, stop the pathetic cheers for others.

5
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,611
and one more thing...

6
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:50,299
A loser is a loser, no matter what. You can never change!

7
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:55,442
You wanna try?

8
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:04,305
You!

9
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,600
I can feel the pain in your heart, Naruto-kun,

10
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:11,779
but the battle must be fought in a real match.

11
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:19,788
We will see if a loser can beat an elite with his
efforts... Im looking forward to the real final matches.

12
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,710
I promise you that...

13
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,706
...I will win no matter what!

14
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:50,717
Crash Gaara!! Youthfulness! Power! Explosion!

15
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:57,174
Hey, Choji. Youre in serious
trouble. Only strong guys are left.

16
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:01,793
That Sound Ninja seems to be the strongest in his team...

17
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:05,818
and I heard that Lee could match up with Sasuke.

18
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:12,119
Especially that Sand guy, his
type is usually the most dangerous.

19
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,705
I do not care... I will immediately forfeit then.

20
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:27,893
Oh I guess that means you dont
want the all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ.

21
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:30,071
Oh, no way...

22
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:37,546
If you get in danger, I will stop
your match like we did for Hinata.

23
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,569
You can eat Kalbi(korean beef) or
anything you want, and as much as you want.

24
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,543
Hey, dont tempt him with food.

25
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:46,076
Ah, by the way, you didnt go down there for Hinata...

26
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:56,310
WooooW! Yakiniku (Korean BBQ)! Lets
go eat Yakiniku! All-I-Can-Eat!!

27
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:01,940
This looks bad...

28
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:04,642
Because of the last match...

29
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,824
Hes starting to awaken...

30
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,864
the demon inside of him.

31
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:18,883
I want to know more about that Neji guy. I guess I have to...

32
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:21,643
Kankuro?

33
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:24,859
Im going to gather some information.

34
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:26,969
Hey!

35
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,748
What?

36
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:32,731
What are you doing there? Dont you need
to go back to where your comrades are?

37
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:36,525
It is none of your business!

38
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,619
Ohh.. I see.

39
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:47,750
Hyuga Neji seems he is still hiding his
real ability from what I saw in his battle.

40
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,337
What kind of guy is he?

41
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:53,362
I will beat him up!

42
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,093
Ah, no... Nobody is asking you that.

43
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,088
Also, you are not even in the same league.

44
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:06,616
You are a funny guy. I like you.

45
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,295
You are not funny. I dont like you!

46
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,032
Bastard! Im gonna kill you!

47
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,334
Well, we will continue the matches.

48
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:30,319
Alright! This must be your turn! Go for it, Lee!

49
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:31,692
NO!

50
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,338
I came this far. Id rather go last.

51
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:42,750
Lee-san, you are so childish.

52
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,585
Come down here already.

53
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,047
Wooooow!

54
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,174
Im saved!

55
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:20,659
Hey! Stop scaring us!

56
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:22,374
Gaara VS Rock Lee

57
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,984
You fell for it!

58
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,817
If I said I wanted to go last, then I know I wont.

59
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,929
Its like if I throw a rock at a pole
trying to hit it, I will miss it.

60
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,964
But if I throw the rock to miss it, then I will hit it.

61
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,411
I used principle!

62
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,484
Wow! Thats my student!

63
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:47,901
I never wanted to go last. You fell for it as I planned!

64
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:50,457
Who fell for it?

65
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:54,550
I will give you some nice advice.

66
00:06:56,521 --> 00:07:03,166
It seems that no one else noticed
it yet, but his gourd is suspicious!!

67
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,058
Oh, I see.

68
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:10,696
Stop taking notes! You wont have time
to read it during a battle. Idiot!

69
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,911
I see.

70
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,097
They didnt notice it untill now?

71
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,811
I wonder if Lee-san is going to be alright.

72
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:23,630
Alright! Go for it, Lee!

73
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:37,178
It is my pleasure to fight against you this early.

74
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:45,857
I dont know what kind of fighting
style that bobbed hair guy has...

75
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,269
But he cannot win against Gaara. Never.

76
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:55,227
He sure did have the speed. But his kick wasnt that good.

77
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,666
No.

78
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,227
He is strong!

79
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,849
Please, dont rush.

80
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:31,054
Be careful, Lee.

81
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,885
Well then. The ninth match.

82
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,463
Begin!

83
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,313
Konoha Senpu (Leaf Wind)

84
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:06,842
Is that...?!

85
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:08,036
Sand?

86
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,136
What a strange technique.

87
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,515
He keeps sand in that gourd?

88
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:15,266
Thats it!

89
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:21,092
Is that all?

90
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,474
Sabaku Kyu (Desert Coffin)

91
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,840
Sabaku SouSou(Desert Graveyard)

92
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,706
That tragedy will happen here again.

93
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:46,609
A jutsu to control the sand... Thats a bit of trouble.

94
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,628
Well, I guess I will try!

95
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,522
The fast attacks from Lee-san cant even touch him.

96
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,039
What is going on here?

97
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,227
No physical attacks can touch him.

98
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:34,395
The sand will protect him as if it were
a shield regardless of Gaaras own control.

99
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:39,579
That is why there has been no one...

100
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:44,307
that could injure Gaara.

101
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,444
Shit! He didnt even move an inch.

102
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,063
Is that all?

103
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:59,111
Wont you let me have some more fun?

104
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:05,225
There is not enough BLOOD!

105
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:25,324
Why does Lee-san use only
Taijutsu? It is not good for a close match.

106
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,085
Hed better use Ninjutsu from a distance.

107
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,036
It is not that he does not use it.

108
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:33,922
He cannot use it.

109
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:39,575
Lee has almost no skills for Ninjutsu and Genjutsu.

110
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,260
Youre kidding?

111
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:48,636
When I first met him, he had no skills... no talent at all.

112
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,004
No way. I cant believe it.

113
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:37,418
It sure is rare to find a Ninja who
cannot use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu.

114
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:46,082
That is why Taijutu is the only
way for Lee to survive as a Ninja.

115
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,387
However, that is also why he can win!

116
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,771
Lee! Take them off!

117
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,590
But Gui-sensei! You told me that I can do so only
when I need to protect a lot of people precious to me.

118
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,554
Who cares! I will allow it now!

119
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:14,528
Is that...

120
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,138
Weights?

121
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,802
What an old style of training.

122
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,716
Oh, I see!

123
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,489
Useless.

124
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,620
Alright! I can move much easier now!

125
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:33,368
Just because he took a little weight off, doesnt
mean that he can catch up with sand of Gaara.

126
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,674
Isnt that a bit too much, Gui?

127
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,835
Go, Lee!

128
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:47,269
Roger!

129
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:04,876
Close!

130
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:06,378
Fast!

131
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:07,862
Incredible!

132
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:21,423
Since he cant use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu he
put all his time into mastering Taijutsu...

133
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:27,075
all his efforts were for Taijutsu, and he
has put everything hes got into Taijutsu.

134
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:34,003
Even if he cannot use any other
jutsu, he will not lose to anybody!

135
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,005
He is the Taijutsu specialist.

136
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:52,931
Unbelievable! Gaara was injured!

137
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,111
No way....

138
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:59,346
Thick-eyebrows is way faster than before!

139
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,484
Was he that strong before?

140
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:05,227
Youthful days are ...

141
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:08,706
Explosive!

142
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,616
Im over here!

143
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:24,978
Good!

144
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,588
I can feel it!

145
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,735
Amazing! He is so fast!

146
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,462
The sand cant keep up with that speed.

147
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,371
He landed his attack perfectly!

148
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:37,045
Amazing.

149
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,199
His attack is too fast.

150
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,278
My eyes cant even follow him.

151
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,769
This is bad.

152
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:00,737
Yup, this is bad. That black eyed dude got a heavy hit!

153
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,920
Thats not the type of bad Im talking about.

154
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:25,165
What is it? His face is falling off...

155
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,399
Hes got sand covering his entire body.

156
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,433
It seems that hes got no injuries!

157
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,835
What is that guy?

158
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:40,538
He was wearing the sand, just as I thought. But...

159
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,267
it has been a long time since I saw the face of Gaara.

160
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:51,657
I knew that he was getting a little bit
more unstable during this Chunin exam, but...

161
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:57,587
The other Gaara is now awakening...

162
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:08,144
Hey, what the heck is it? Did he use the sand to
protect himself from that attack by Thick-eyebrow?

163
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:11,122
Yeah. That is his Sand armor.

164
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,432
Armor?

165
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,859
In a normal situation, the sand
shield protects Gaara automatically.

166
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,408
Even if that fails, the sand armor will still protect him.

167
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,477
that is the Absolute defense of Gaara.

168
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:30,432
Is that? What can he do then? There are no weak points at all.

169
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:37,848
No, I would not say that. In reality,
the sand armor has a lot of weak points.

170
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:44,749
Because it is not automatic, he uses up a lot of
Chakra. Plus, the defense level is lower than the Sand shield.

171
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:49,022
Since the sand covers his body
closely, he also uses up his stamina.

172
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:56,169
It is a proof that he is at the
disadvantage, because he needs to use that.

173
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,424
That Lee guy is better than I thought.

174
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,693
But the result is obvious.

175
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,740
He can never beat Gaara.

176
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,365
Is that all?

177
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:17,753
What kind of protection does he have... Even though
I can move more quickly, my attacks do not get to him.

178
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:23,609
I have no other choice but to land a
powerful hit to get through his sand.

179
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,538
I must use the Renge (Lotus).

180
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:46,492
Prepare yourself.

181
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,397
With the Lotus of Lee that drops at high-speed,
the thin protection of the sand wont be a problem.

182
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,792
Come at me, already.

183
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,018
As you wish!

184
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,654
Not high enough!

185
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,117
Not yet!

186
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,572
What great continuous kicks!

187
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:27,263
Even the regular Lotus will do a lot of damage to his body.

188
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,498
Finish with this one, Lee!

189
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:45,391
Take this!

190
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,112
Omote Renge! (Front Lotus)

191
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,201
I did feel it!

192
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,298
Great!

193
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,391
It is over.

194
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,646
No way... you must be kidding me.

195
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:29,705
Yes! Lee san won!

196
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:32,975
Hey hey. Is he dead, isnt he?

197
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:01,525
What?

198
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:41,587
Hey, hey. What happen to you,
thick-eyebrow. You no longer show the power you had.

199
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,489
You will get beaten up if you stay like that!

200
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:48,857
What? The thick-eyebrow is smiling.

201
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:52,999
How can he stay relaxed like that even
though he is in this bad situation?

202
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:58,765
Next episode. Hot-blooded loser! Finally
blossom. Forbidden secret technique!

203
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:02,594
The look in the eyes of the thick-eyebrow changed!
