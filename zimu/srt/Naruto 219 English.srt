1
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:13,937
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,663
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,267
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:57,949
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:04,923
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:17,562
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,436
This is as far as you go.
Give Matsuri back.

12
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,571
You think you've got me cornered now?

13
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:01,412
Don't get the wrong idea.
You're the one who's been cornered!

14
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:02,610
What?

15
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:05,914
Byakugan!

16
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:11,684
He has the final enemy cornered
in a dead end valley.

17
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,821
The area around the valley
is eerily calm.

18
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,097
I don't see his comrades.

19
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,065
Is Shikamaru's final move finished?

20
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:24,860
No.

21
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:28,039
We can't state definitively that
they've reached a deadlock.

22
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:33,106
It's because it's possible that
the battles thus far were diversions.

23
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,888
Just a little more, Lee.

24
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,719
It'll be over once I connect
two or three more muscles.

25
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,057
<i>Sakura's Medical Ninja technique</i>
<i>is really becoming...</i>

26
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:53,727
<i>And yet I...</i>

27
00:02:56,869 --> 00:03:02,398
The treatment is over for now.
How do you fight to get like this?

28
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,007
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:08,044
You saved me.
Thank you, Sakura.

30
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:09,904
You're welcome.

31
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,209
Oh, you can't, yet.

32
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:16,818
As one of the Medical Team members,
I prohibit you from fighting any further.

33
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,990
No, please let me go.

34
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,459
I can't just leave Gaara like this...

35
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,562
We're Team Return the Favor, after all.

36
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:30,528
<i>The Ultimate Weapon Reborn</i>

37
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:35,267
Gaara, you may very well be
called the ultimate weapon,

38
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,209
but have you not used up all of
your sand in the fight earlier?

39
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:43,841
<i>This is my weapon.</i>

40
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:49,620
<i>Indeed I have used up almost all</i>
<i>of the sand with Chakra built up inside.</i>

41
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,086
<i>But...</i>

42
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:57,393
No matter what Jutsu you use,
I must not lose in a one on one battle.

43
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:01,358
There's nothing scary about
a Shinobi with no weapon!

44
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,403
Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!

45
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,855
Fang Release: Dark Sword!
Flying Double Edge Sword!

46
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,993
You'll realize that the likes
of a mere Ninja

47
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:37,468
is no match for the Ninja tools
created by us artisans.

48
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:55,784
Fang Release: Dark Sword!

49
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,964
It seems your own body's Chakra
has run out.

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,865
You're carrying
a monster inside you, right?

51
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,265
Now, isn't it about time
you used the power of Shukaku?

52
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,058
You okay?

53
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,590
Gaara Sensei is...

54
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,757
Yeah, I know.

55
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,098
Listen up.
You hide in a safe place somewhere.

56
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:47,131
Right.

57
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:52,201
Although Gaara received
Sakura's treatment, he's still...

58
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,810
That's as far as you go,
ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!

59
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:05,649
Damn it.

60
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,424
Use the power of the Shukaku already.

61
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,491
Hey!

62
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,259
Hold it!

63
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,032
Who are you?

64
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,860
I'll be your opponent from here on.

65
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,837
You're in the way, boy.

66
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,202
Kujaku Hurricane!

67
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,345
Damn it!

68
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,713
Leaf Shinobi, you watch.

69
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:34,818
The era of control by
the Five Great Nations will end.

70
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,712
No, it won't be just that.

71
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,749
If the ultimate Ninja tool created by
the Artisan Village is completed,

72
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:46,058
the existence of the Ninja
will no longer be necessary.

73
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,597
What're you talking about?!

74
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,902
We are people from the Village
of Artisans who for many years

75
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,701
have equally shared
exceptional Ninja tools

76
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,708
with you in the Five Great Nations.

77
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,174
However, each time relations
worsened between fellow villages,

78
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,146
the Village of Artisans would be attacked

79
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,877
over fear of Ninja tools crossing
over to the other village.

80
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:08,112
You Ninja of the Five Great Nations
have forgotten

81
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,985
that you are kept alive by our power,

82
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,287
and have returned the favor
with vengeance time and again.

83
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:16,892
Although we the people of
the Village of Artisans have advanced skills,

84
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:21,263
we have had to survive by currying favor
from the Five Great Nations!

85
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:25,130
However, that era will now end!

86
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:27,837
First, I will take out the Leaf Village.

87
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,875
Fang Release Dark Sword!

88
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,471
How long can you run away for?

89
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,180
I'll stake you like a shrike!

90
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:51,291
What?!

91
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,665
You!

92
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,300
<i>Gaara Sensei!</i>

93
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:06,274
<i>Gaara Sensei's sand</i>
<i>protected the Leaf Ninja.</i>

94
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:12,916
That dome created with hard minerals
in the ground mixed with sand...

95
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:16,455
can't be smashed by such junk.

96
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,249
I'll protect him until the end...

97
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,817
with my power!

98
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,153
Gaara Sensei!

99
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,226
Don't make me laugh!

100
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:31,360
You, who are called the greatest creation
of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,

101
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,132
are going to protect someone else?

102
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,734
And you're going to use
what little Chakra you have left

103
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,275
for the sake of a comrade?

104
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,309
But that will be your death!

105
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:50,522
Gaara Sensei!

106
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,954
With this,
all preparations are complete.

107
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:55,761
Damn it.

108
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:01,790
Oh!

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,934
Gaara!

110
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:13,936
We were contacted by someone
from the Village of Artisans.

111
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,411
It seems ones calling themselves
the Four Celestials,

112
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,610
bearing long withstanding hostilities
against the Five Great Nations...

113
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:23,888
have completed forbidden research and
are attempting to resurrect

114
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,821
the ultimate weapon of folklore
in the village.

115
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,292
It seems the villagers got
wind of the crisis

116
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,353
and have evacuated to
a different location.

117
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:35,224
I see. So that's why the village
was completely empty.

118
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:39,195
So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?

119
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,540
The resurrection of Seimei,
the founder of the Village of Artisans.

120
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,200
Seimei?!

121
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,611
Are you saying
they're trying to raise the dead?!

122
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,477
I see. It makes sense that
the mausoleum was violated.

123
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:56,019
As for us, we must prevent
the resurrection

124
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:57,851
of the ultimate weapon at all costs.

125
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:00,148
I understand. I'll be off.

126
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:02,555
Oh, hold on.

127
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:03,788
Yes?

128
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:06,855
I'll be having one more person
accompany you on this mission.

129
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,825
What? Who would that be?

130
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,571
What we wanted was
the Shukaku's Chakra.

131
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,077
What did you say?

132
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:22,772
How we've waited for this time.

133
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,517
Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.

134
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:29,320
And infuse me with that power.

135
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,080
Gaara!

136
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,554
I'll save you now.

137
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:33,819
Naruto!

138
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,327
<i>Matsuri, take this.</i>

139
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:44,564
My rope javelin.

140
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:57,877
<i>The optic nerves have connected...</i>

141
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,309
<i>Open...</i>

142
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:02,711
<i>third eye!</i>

143
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,226
Hey, you.

144
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,790
What the heck do you intend to start?

145
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,458
I'll show you.

146
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,563
The ultimate Ninja tool created
by Lord Seimei,

147
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,069
the founder of our Village of Artisans.

148
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,367
Ultimate Ninja tool?

149
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:25,135
Now is the time of its completion.

150
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:45,456
Gaara!

151
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:05,374
Oh, Lord Seimei.

152
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:09,854
Please take possession of my flesh
and complete your resurrection!

153
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:16,521
Oh!

154
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,405
What's going on? He vanished.

155
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,988
The dead body came back to life!

156
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,499
My name is Seimei.
The founder of the Village of Artisans.

157
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,537
A hundred years have passed and

158
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:06,077
I have now been resurrected
as the ultimate Ninja tool

159
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,442
of the Village of Artisans!

160
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,716
What in the world is happening here?!

161
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:33,738
My long awaited wish has at last
come to fruition.

162
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,604
With this, my Village of Artisans will reign
over the Shinobi apex

163
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,046
I see...

164
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:45,875
So the monster from the Sand Village
became the source of my power.

165
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:47,710
Say what?

166
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,012
Hoko said this.

167
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:53,257
There is a monster lying
within the body

168
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,555
of the one called Gaara
from the Sand Village.

169
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,729
Once that person is in a cage,

170
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,890
soon he will become
a complete monster, the Shukaku.

171
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:07,368
I will take away what you could
consider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.

172
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,539
I won't let you do that!

173
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:38,370
Damn it!

174
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,937
Just wait, Gaara.
I'll get you out now.

175
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,818
What a waste...

176
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:56,353
Vortex Wind.

177
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:03,251
I'm just getting started!

178
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,357
What a fool!

179
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,037
I'll get you out now!

180
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,303
Damn it, damn it!

181
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:22,407
Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!

182
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:26,776
Gaara, answer me!
What's going on in there?!

183
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,250
Gaara!

184
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,579
Gaara!

185
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:39,256
N -Naruto...

186
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,416
Shikamaru!

187
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,613
What?

188
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,250
Where are Gaara and Naruto?

189
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:07,087
Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.

190
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,127
There's a cage behind an area
surrounded by rocks...

191
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:14,022
There's a massive amount of Chakra
being extracted from there.

192
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,123
Gaara must be inside.

193
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,029
Hey, Shikamaru!

194
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:21,100
What?

195
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:25,503
You know there's a terrifying power
lying dormant inside Gaara, right?

196
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:27,878
Yeah, generally.

197
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:30,982
Something terrible will happen...

198
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,714
if Gaara has Chakra extracted like this
and he loses himself!

199
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,786
The Shukaku that had been kept
under control will go out of control.

200
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:42,322
Once it starts going berserk,
there will be no way to stop Gaara.

201
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:43,927
For real?

202
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,024
I must not waste any more time.

203
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,098
The entertainment ends here.

204
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,573
Hot-hot-hot -hot.

205
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:02,280
Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!

206
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,711
I'll get you out now!

207
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,908
You're a pest!

208
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,711
Give it up already!

209
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,155
I'm just getting started!

210
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,432
Solid Blanks!

211
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:48,887
Oh, how I have waited for this time.

212
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,792
Now, Shukaku! Give me power!

213
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:06,203
I feel it. This is an amazing power!

214
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,459
Cut out the futile resistance.

215
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:34,404
The power of the Shukaku
is already mine!

216
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,740
I declare war on the Five Great Nations.

217
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:42,839
The Shinobi in the Five Great Nations
who made light of the Artisan Shinobi

218
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:47,914
will fully realize the 100 year grudge
of the Artisan Ninja.

219
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,947
And they will inevitably
become our sacrifices.

220
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,284
Knock it off!

221
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,153
What?!

222
00:18:54,426 --> 00:19:00,058
We won't hand over our power
to the likes of you.

223
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,895
I won't let you take away any more
of Gaara's Chakra.

224
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,061
You got that?!

225
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:13,003
How can that person fight
while getting that beaten up?

226
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,972
Why do you go this far, kid?

227
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,410
What is the monster of
the Sand Villag to you?

228
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,013
Gaara...

229
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:28,318
Gaara is an important comrade to me!

230
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:33,263
<i>He said he fights for</i>
<i>those important to him.</i>

231
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,368
Fights for someone important.

232
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:43,435
Very well. Then die!

233
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,954
What're you doing, little girl?

234
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,386
I finally figured out what
Gaara Sensei taught me.

235
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,554
Weapons took away the lives
of my mother and father.

236
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,895
But I can also protect those important
to me with a weapon!

237
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,599
Foolishness.

238
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:21,275
Damn it!

239
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:28,878
It has finally begun, huh...?

240
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,165
Gaara Sensei...

241
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:52,872
Gaara!

242
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,722
Gaara.

243
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:23,271
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

244
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:29,611
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

245
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:39,421
<i>Even if rains of spears were to fall,</i>
<i>I will run through it</i>

246
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:44,019
<i>Because I want to find the joy</i>
<i>without a shape</i>

247
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:48,965
<i>This big dream of mine that</i>
<i>cannot be translated to words,</i>

248
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:53,835
<i>I will make it come true,</i>
<i>even if it were to deepen my wounds</i>

249
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:58,808
<i>We stand here today because of</i>
<i>what we believed through,</i>

250
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:03,041
<i>That is why I will continue running forward,</i>
<i>never looking away</i>

251
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:07,518
<i>Even if I'm told that</i>
<i>there is no bright future</i>

252
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:14,924
<i>I'll change it right away,</i>
<i>lighting it with all my feeling</i>

253
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:18,827
<i>The wind is probably testing our hearts</i>

254
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:24,096
<i>In my heart, I gently grasped my hands</i>

255
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:28,230
<i>You are probably searching for</i>
<i>the answer to your tears</i>

256
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:33,107
<i>Your dream is always waiting near by,</i>
<i>with the answers in its hands</i>

257
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:37,805
<i>The Key to the rusted heart's door</i>

258
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:43,947
<i>Will always be smiling right near by</i>

259
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,090
Hey, that's...

260
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,631
- We were too late.
- Then, you mean...

261
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,667
Yes. He is starting to transform
to Shukaku.

262
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:58,134
Damn! What should we do?

263
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:01,366
This is bad.
If Gaara loses his conscious in that state,

264
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,203
the true Shukaku will come out.

265
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,367
When that happens
he won't know a foe from friend,

266
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,412
he will just destroy everything.

267
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,776
All we can do is just stand here
and watch?!

268
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:15,111
Next time: "Departure"
