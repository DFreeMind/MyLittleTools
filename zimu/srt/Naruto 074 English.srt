2
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,260
This isn't good.

3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,230
Pakkun?

4
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,880
Sakura-chan?

5
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,430
Why did you guys stop so suddenly?!

6
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,900
The smell of Sasuke and two others...

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,840
is moving away quickly.

8
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,320
I guess Sasuke is chasing those two.

9
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,670
What?

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,040
Sasuke-kun is chasing them?

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,420
The others don't seem to be moving from there

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,830
but...

13
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,700
Stop wasting time here and let's go after Sasuke.

14
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,540
But what?

15
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,950
Those who were left behind seem to have started fighting.

16
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,620
Though it will be a bit out of our way, we
have to take another route to avoid them.

17
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,440
Why? Doing so will delay us in catching up
with Sasuke. Let's go straight through it.

18
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,590
What're you saying, Naruto?!

19
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,500
You don't know what'll happen in a battle zone.

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,370
There's a possibility that we'll be forced into the battle.

21
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,710
That has nothing to do with this.

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:53,740
Kid, if our mission is to retrieve Sasuke. Then, it's
an absolute must that we avoid any battles until then.

23
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,440
Let's get moving!

24
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,420
Roger.

25
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,950
Fine, I get it.

26
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,540
Kugutsu-no-jutsu (puppet)

27
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:11,300
I am from the Aburame clan of Konoha. When I fight, I never
underestimate the opponent, even if it's a worthless bug. I'll do my best.

28
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,850
You irritate me.

29
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,170
Let me down, Temari.

30
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,280
Can you move now, Gaara?

31
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,820
Gaara!

32
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,600
Kankuro is helping to stop Uchiha now.

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,210
While he's doing so,...

34
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,750
I've got to hurry up, otherwise the plan will be...

35
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,680
Temari, wait over there.

36
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,490
What?

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,080
Shut up and just go over there now! You stand in my way.

38
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,660
Astonishment! Gaara's true identity

39
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,780
There's poison on that blade.

40
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,890
I won't let you run away.

41
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:52,550
That's Uchiha Sasuke? How did he get past Kankuro? It can't
be, that was too quick. Did someone else come to chase us?

42
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,190
I don't know what the Sand is planning, but...

43
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,010
I'll put a stop to it!

44
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,040
And...

45
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,150
I'll see your true identity.

46
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,580
Gaara!

47
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:28,910
Don't tell me he's going to awaken that one here
right how? NO way. This is way out of my hands.

48
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,310
Stop, Gaara. Did you forget about the plan?

49
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,920
You, who are strong...

50
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,540
You, who're called Uchiha...

51
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,610
You, who have friends...

52
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,950
You, who are determined...

53
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,140
You, who are similar...

54
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
to ME!

55
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,060
I'll exist in this world as one who
erased everything of you by killing you.

56
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,340
I can then experience "life".

57
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,510
What's the matter?

58
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,550
If you keep releasing that thirst for blood
atmosphere, you're not hiding well. Come on out.

59
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,380
It's you....

60
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,790
What is your purpose? For what do you want the power?

61
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,470
It's none of your business. Leave.
You're disturbing my training.

62
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:58,580
You have the same eyes that I have. Eyes that show you
want power... eyes full of hate and intention to kill.

63
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,460
You're similar to me. Don't forget that you are my...

64
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,730
You are my...

65
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,380
You are my...

66
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,580
prey!

67
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,220
It's started....

68
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,050
Kawarimi

69
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,320
You're not good enough.

70
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,160
Got him.

71
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,760
Bugs?!

72
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,160
Creating a clone with bugs to come
around behind me. You're doing good.

73
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,980
You are a mid to long range fighter with that
puppet. I think you as not good in close quarters.

74
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,960
Because, the  Kugutsu-no-jutsu requires you
to focus on controlling a puppet it will...

75
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,550
makes the person who controls it have an blind spot.

76
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,740
You seem to understand the weakness of the Kugutsu-shi (puppet master), but

77
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,350
I'll teach you the real way of
fighting with this Jutsu and...

78
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,480
the real dreadfulness of the Senjutsu
Karakuri Karasu. (war tactics puppet)

79
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,330
This is a poison smoke ball.

80
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:34,390
I might breath in a bit. And I see, the Jutsusha will hide out.

81
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,290
Listen everyone.

82
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,440
In case one of the enemy Ninja's appears,
don't panic and enter into the hidden rooms.

83
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,830
The Jounin and Chunin sensei's
will protect you with their lives.

84
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,000
Konohamaru-chan!

85
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,120
It's ok.

86
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,350
Everybody's doing their best. We
can make enemies go away quickly.

87
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,380
A crack on the Hokage's face rock...

88
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,100
How ominous...

89
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,110
Grandpa...

90
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:27,200
I came to this, to this point... and you tell me
I don't have enough power to pull his soul out.

91
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,740
You tell me this old body is still
not enough, even though I die for this?

92
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,890
I believe you could've killed me
if you were ten more years younger.

93
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,290
Sarutobi, if you don't kill this man now, this
village will be destroyed. Do you understand that?

94
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,870
I know that.

95
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,500
You should be dead already.

96
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,140
Let me feel it!

97
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,960
That eye...

98
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,210
That's the eye I saw earlier.

99
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,440
I guess I won't finish until you come, Shino.

100
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,970
I see the poison is taking effect
now. I'll finish you off now.

101
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,390
Bugs again? But I don’t think he can
move around that much with that condition.

102
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,840
I'll end your suffering soon.

103
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,970
What? What's going on?!

104
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,950
What's going on?

105
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,690
No way!

106
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,960
It's useless. This one can't move anymore

107
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,380
I had my bugs go into all the joints.

108
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,220
Disabling it by sticking bugs in joints?
He was planning that from the beginning?

109
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,200
Bugs are coming down on my chakra strings.

110
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,980
Why?

111
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,970
That's right... their food is chakra, if I remember correctly.

112
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,380
My position will be found out with this.

113
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,410
He cut the charka strings.

114
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:37,750
You got off guard. It's nothing for a first class Kugutsu-shi
(Puppet master) to reconnect the chakra strings after you cut it once.

115
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:45,160
Plus, Karasu is a Shikomi-Kugutsu (trick puppet), which
has hidden weapons in every single part of the body.

116
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,120
If you were thinking that it's over just
by stopping its movement, You were WRONG!

117
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,700
I put a lot of poison on the tip of that needle...

118
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,330
Die!

119
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,380
What?!

120
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,560
Since when are those bugs here... The chakra strings are already eaten up.

121
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,950
What? Why? Where did those bugs come from?

122
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,030
You didn't notice bugs moving
behind you since you lowered your...

123
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,340
guard after taking care of the decoy,
and the bugs on the chakra strings.

124
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,020
The bugs had been moving all the time, to reach your forehead protector.

125
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,930
What?

126
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:11,700
That early blow... I pretended
to miss and put the one bug on you.

127
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,110
But how can you could find out
my position with only one bug?

128
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,750
I don't like to explain same thing twice.

129
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,120
Shino? Why you are here?

130
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:44,370
Before you left the arena, I put a female bug
on you. The scent of female is almost nothing.

131
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,470
Only the male of the same kind can
sense the faint scent of the female.

132
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,250
That means, the one on my forehead is...

133
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,670
Yes, it's female.

134
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,810
Is the poison all over my body?

135
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,520
I guess I can't come to be your
back up. Sorry, Uchiha Sasuke.

136
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,490
He...

137
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,510
Are you afraid of me, Uchiha Sasuke?

138
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:51,290
Of my existence? Come out, Uchiha Sasuke!

139
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:01,610
You are my Prey!

140
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,270
Man, what speed and power

141
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,790
I'd be in pieces if I didn't use
my Sharingan to read his movement.

142
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,180
But just defending won't do anything.

143
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,740
What should I do? How should I stop him?

144
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,030
I guess I have to use it...

145
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,400
But Chidori isn't...

146
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,030
Next Episode
Over the limit...
Sasuke's Decision!!
