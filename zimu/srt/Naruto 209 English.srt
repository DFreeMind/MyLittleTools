00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:13,937
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

2
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>The distance created between us</i>
<i>became too big,</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>because we were always together</i>

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,663
<i>Your honest reply, "See you..."</i>

5
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,267
<i>coming from that brash mouth</i>
<i>makes it sadder.</i>

6
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:57,949
<i>If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying</i>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:04,923
<i>Then I want to deliver you a smile,</i>
<i>even if I'm not by your side</i>

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:17,562
<i>Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,</i>
<i>into your hands</i>

9
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,972
<i>I can feel it so close,</i>

10
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>Our two hearts</i>

11
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,100
- Monju.
- Yes, sir.

12
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,325
Darn, didn't know there was a kid here.

13
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,926
I'll do it.

14
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,661
Okay, it's in your hands, Gantetsu.

15
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,368
Okay, Let's pull out!

16
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,343
Set this place on fire!

17
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,809
Don't leave any evidence.

18
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:16,846
<i>The Enemy. Ninja Dropouts</i>

19
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,247
Wait up!

20
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:27,420
Over here! You're it. Try catching me!

21
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:28,961
Darn...

22
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:30,852
- Yeah!
- This way! This way!

23
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,726
I said wait!

24
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:39,705
Lady Tsunade...

25
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,001
With regard to the next request...

26
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,403
What, there's more?

27
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:45,444
Yes.

28
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:47,804
Boy oh boy...

29
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,144
This is the last one
so please try to focus.

30
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:52,408
All right.

31
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:58,189
When the weather continues
to be warm like this...

32
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,520
And what's the request?

33
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:04,929
About the escort for the convoy with
the fugitive who was secured...

34
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:08,296
What about it,
that's hardly a difficult mission.

35
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,665
Well, actually there's a bit
of a problem.

36
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:12,226
Please look at this.

37
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,274
I see. This is somewhat of
a nuisance.

38
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:22,275
All of the Jonin are out
on S rank missions,

39
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:26,448
and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin
have been allocated elsewhere.

40
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:28,511
Who's left?

41
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:32,115
Let's see... well...

42
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,659
Multi Clone Jutsu!

43
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,900
Let's go, Bushy Brows!

44
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:08,860
Here goes, Naruto!

45
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,696
Leaf Hurricane!

46
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,028
You jerk!

47
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,904
Another serving of
Shadow Clones for you!

48
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,578
You ain't seen nothing yet!

49
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,154
You let your guard down!

50
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:46,424
Pretty good, Bushy Brow...

51
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,358
The same to you, Naruto...

52
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,532
Naruto! Lee!

53
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:12,918
Hey, are you guys all right?

54
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,886
Hey, stop moving.

55
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,627
Sakura, can't you be
a little more gentle?

56
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:26,138
Shut your mouth.
Really, you're being reckless.

57
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,270
That's not true, Sakura.

58
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,235
See, the 100 man
Shadow Clone grapples

59
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,608
are excellent training
for enhancing one's Taijutsu skills.

60
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,576
It's like killing two birds with
one stone for Naruto, too

61
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,550
because this kind of friendly training
lets him polish

62
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,416
his Shadow Clone skills
at the same time.

63
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,353
That's exactly right.

64
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:47,015
What are you talking about?
All you're doing is slugging it out.

65
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,322
This is what ends up happening
when two guys get together.

66
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,597
That's right.

67
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,901
Anyway, this isn't the time to be
acting carefree like that.

68
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,699
Lady Tsunade is calling for you.

69
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,638
Grandma Tsunade?

70
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:02,841
What does she want?

71
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,079
Ninja Dropouts?

72
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,409
Yeah.
Ninja Dropouts are

73
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,747
Rogue Ninja who,
of their own free will,

74
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,685
choose not to be Shinobi and leave
their respective villages to join up.

75
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:20,024
They're a gang of thieves who use brutal
and villainous means to steal.

76
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,528
That's horrible... using their abilities
as Ninja for criminal purposes.

77
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,854
That's unforgivable.

78
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:29,267
One of their members was
captured yesterday

79
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,859
in Ogi Pass
in the Land of Forests.

80
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,797
This guy is the only member

81
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:35,397
whose wanted notice is
circling around the lands.

82
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,974
He was found wandering about
and taken prisoner.

83
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,570
His name is Gantetsu.

84
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,380
For a former Ninja,
that's pretty lame.

85
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,185
Gantesu is being taken to
the capital city of the Land of Forests

86
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,088
in order to do an exhaustive investigation
into this matter

87
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,718
for the purpose of wiping out
the Ninja Dropouts...

88
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:57,853
However, there is a possibility
that the Ninja Dropouts will try

89
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,158
to rescue him along the way...

90
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,734
A police escort has been sent
from the capital

91
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,565
so it is fully prepared for the convoy.

92
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,295
But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,

93
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,034
the idea is that Shinobi would be
the best countermeasure for Shinobi,

94
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,474
so they requested that the Leaf Village
also send out some Ninja.

95
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:13,568
That's what this request is all about.

96
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:18,206
I'm getting excited! I'll show'em
how great Leaf Ninja are!

97
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:20,975
- Got it!
- Let's give it a shot!

98
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:25,354
All right! Naruto Uzumaki,
Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.

99
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,191
The three of you are assigned
to the mission

100
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,489
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!

101
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,759
- Yes, ma'am!
- Roger!

102
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,203
Look, the harbor.

103
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:50,010
Huh... So they're gonna
transport him in this.

104
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,709
The only way to get to the capital
of the Land of Forests is

105
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,185
to go up this river.

106
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,449
Hey, look over there.

107
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:03,462
That's...

108
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,019
The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.

109
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,723
Are you the Leaf Ninja?

110
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,730
Yes. Uh, and who are you?

111
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,802
I'm Tsuzumi with the police department.

112
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,896
I'm supervising this convoy.

113
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,831
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

114
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:20,806
This guy here's Bushy Brows and
her name is Sakura Haruno.

115
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:26,708
Hmmm... You guys are still kids...
Are you really Ninja?

116
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,253
We sure are.

117
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,049
Huh, we might not look it,

118
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:34,058
but we're all full fledged Ninja who've
been tested by fire numerous times.

119
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,187
We'll display our skills for you
at some point.

120
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,031
Just leave it to us.

121
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:43,491
Well, I have a strong team of
experts handling security,

122
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,127
but if it ever comes to that,

123
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:47,104
I'm counting on you to use
your specialty, Ninjutsu.

124
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:48,440
Got it.

125
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,142
Those are the security personnel
guarding the prisoner.

126
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,140
They're all dressed alike, aren't they?

127
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:02,214
Huh, they don't have much style.

128
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,153
Naruto, that's rude.

129
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,064
Captain Todoroki!

130
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:14,795
What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?

131
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,234
These people came from

132
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,065
the V illage Hidden in the Leaves
as reinforcements.

133
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,229
The name's Naruto Uzumaki.

134
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm Sakura Haruno.

135
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:22,938
My name is Rock Lee.

136
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:27,445
Commander, I told you already.

137
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,714
We already have enough security on this.

138
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:33,210
Can't be helped.
It's something the bosses decided.

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,685
There won't be any role for
you guys to play.

140
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,980
We will guard Gantetsu.

141
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,224
I promise that on this sword.

142
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,554
Huh... That sword's nothing.

143
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,764
Snapping that thing in half would be
as easy as apple pie.

144
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,533
Yeah, with just one finger.

145
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,230
Stop it, you guys!
Please excuse them...

146
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:57,007
Be careful not to get seasick.

147
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:58,801
Well, I leave it to you.

148
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,644
Y Yes, sir. Thanks.

149
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:08,353
<i>Gantetsu...</i>

150
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,056
All right...

151
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:12,819
Put the cage into the belly of the ship!

152
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,484
Okay... Okay...

153
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,061
Okay, lower it!

154
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,827
Wow...

155
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,259
This feels great!

156
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,094
What the heck is this anyway?

157
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,457
They won't let us even get near him.

158
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,858
They're totally treating us like nuisances.

159
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:32,695
If only those Ninja Dropout guys
would launch an attack,

160
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,535
we could show them how awesome
we are.

161
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't say stupid things like that.

162
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,803
The best scenario would be that
the Ninja Dropout won't show up at all.

163
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:44,649
Our mission is to transport Gantetsu
safely to the capital, you know.

164
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,215
But this is getting too boring...
there's no thrill to it.

165
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,449
Better just grin and bear it.

166
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,512
There are missions like this too.

167
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:55,623
Well, I sure understand
how you feel, Naruto.

168
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,794
Yeah... I guess this is getting
a little boring.

169
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,057
Dig in...

170
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,025
Gimme a break...

171
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,261
Who do those guys think we are?

172
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,067
But this stuff is pretty good.

173
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,571
Yeah, very tasty.

174
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,640
It makes me so mad...

175
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:52,445
I mean, why did we go to all
the trouble of coming all this way?

176
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,885
I'm gonna do my mission.

177
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,549
Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.

178
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:02,055
But the captain's gonna scold you.

179
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:03,421
I'm doing this out of Ninja pride!

180
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:06,825
Uh, Naruto!

181
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:07,866
Naruto!

182
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,951
He does have the face of
a criminal after all.

183
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,797
<i>Todoroki?</i>

184
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,859
What the heck is he doing here?

185
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,367
<i>Akio...!</i>

186
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,185
Damn!

187
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,356
Father! Mother!

188
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,338
Akio...

189
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:26,344
Akio!

190
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,305
Damn!

191
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:00,712
<i>Akio...!</i>

192
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,039
<i>I will avenge your death right now!</i>

193
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,098
Oh!

194
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:21,792
What the heck are you doing?!

195
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,600
Are you in your right mind?

196
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,970
What was it you were about
to do just now?!

197
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:47,023
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.

198
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:15,386
Oh?

199
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,751
What's the matter, Sakura?

200
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,382
Lee, over there.

201
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,164
That's strange...

202
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:28,796
I've never knew this river has a tributary.

203
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:33,804
Why are you in here?

204
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,301
Why does that matter?

205
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,867
What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?

206
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:41,579
What are you talking about?

207
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,172
It looked to me like
you were going to kill him.

208
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,519
Huh? Me?
That's a stupid thing to say.

209
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:52,483
It's my mission to guard this guy.
Why would I?!

210
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:53,658
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:55,124
Even if he is a criminal,

212
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:59,130
you can't just kill him off
without interrogating him first.

213
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,559
A brat talking like he knows, huh?

214
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,898
There isn't any need to interrogate him!

215
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,470
This is the guy who did it!

216
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:06,938
Huh?

217
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,039
This guy...

218
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:13,274
These guys... slaughtered a lot of people
without mercy...

219
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:16,340
Even innocent children.

220
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,786
If things continue like this,
we'll be sucked into the tributary...

221
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:28,293
What should we do?!

222
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:38,292
Ninja Art: Link and Slay.

223
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,953
What the heck?!

224
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,152
Wh What is this?

225
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,664
Th The ship's been sliced in half...

226
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,369
Naruto!

227
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:18,940
Naruto!

228
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,886
You jerk!

229
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,288
It's them! The Ninja Dropouts!

230
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:35,460
So they showed up after all...

231
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:41,466
Gantetsu...

232
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:49,540
Reinforcements, huh?!

233
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,909
Hey, who are you guys anyway!

234
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:56,471
The head of the Ninja Dropouts,
Shura, on the scene!

235
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,219
Ninja Dropouts...

236
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,453
We'll take Gantetsu...

237
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,555
I'm not about to let that happen!

Lee, are you all right?

255
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:55,924
Yes, somehow.
More importantly, what happened?

256
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:57,001
I don't know.

257
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,195
Only thing I know is that after
that huge crash,

258
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,761
suddenly the ship was sliced in two...

259
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,806
I see.

260
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,802
Well then, we need to confirm everyone's
safety for the moment...

261
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:05,910
Well...

262
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:07,374
What's wrong, Sakura?

263
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:12,143
I can't find the prisoner, Gantetsu,
Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.
