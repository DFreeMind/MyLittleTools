1
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:21,697
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:26,507
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,139
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:36,345
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:46,263
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:55,634
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:06,416
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:15,892
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:21,023
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:50,525
Where's Naruto?

12
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,893
It's no good.
I can't find him.

13
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:54,324
I see...

14
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,900
He's not close by anymore.

15
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,238
Either he drifted away...

16
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:01,466
or he has escaped.

17
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:06,236
At any rate, with this fog...

18
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,877
There's no reason to
remain here any longer.

19
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:15,614
Let's make it to a shore nearby
and start again.

20
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,380
Understood.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,837
<i>The Closed Door</i>

22
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,376
It's been a while, Lord Orochimaru.

23
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,473
It truly has.

24
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:46,910
To think I'd stop by on
a whim to find you still here.

25
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:51,949
And it's for that reason that
I am able to meet with you again.

26
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,224
So does the fact that
you're here mean

27
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:59,059
you're still continuing that research?

28
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,062
Yes.

29
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,631
And I think someday it will be
of help to you, Lord Orochimaru...

30
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,933
I wonder if that's true.

31
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:10,008
And all this is due to my loyalty.

32
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:13,670
Do whatever you like...

33
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,341
Thank you.

34
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:17,606
By the way...

35
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:20,151
is he the one you were
talking of earlier?

36
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,050
Yes, he's Itachi Uchiha's
younger brother.

37
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,090
Oh really...

38
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,723
Yes, my...

39
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,352
Please don't...

40
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:33,958
say anything unnecessary!

41
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,866
It appears that Naruto
is no longer close by.

42
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:45,130
Hey...

43
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:48,735
Naruto, surely he's safe, isn't he?

44
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,842
He can't be beaten that easily.

45
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,711
After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi...

46
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,752
Shiragiku Inn
I'm responsible for guarding
the ships collecting funds.

47
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:05,219
I'm Hitode.

48
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,448
I know the circumstances,

49
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:11,292
your colleague has disappeared
and I'm sure that you're worried...

50
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,722
Have you received
any information since then?

51
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,968
I'm sorry, but there's been
no information

52
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,800
regarding a victim rescued
from a shipwreck.

53
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:21,169
I see.

54
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,702
However, I'm troubled.

55
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:27,440
This is difficult to say,

56
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:30,243
but the departure of the collection ships
has been pushed forward...

57
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:31,608
Pushed forward?

58
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,946
Now we're scheduled to
leave tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,657
We apologize for
our late notice.

60
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,582
As expected,
a large number of people find

61
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,355
the relationship with
Land of Water very important

62
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:46,398
and we had to push
the departure forward.

63
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:48,829
I understand.

64
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,903
But we'd like to take time here

65
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,302
to seek and investigate
our colleague...

66
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,670
Of course.

67
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,905
We'll meet you directly
at the port tomorrow

68
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,706
for the guard duty.

69
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,338
Thank you for cooperating.

70
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,551
Just one thing.

71
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:07,883
Yes...

72
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:11,616
As you can see, we are
not a very wealthy country.

73
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,283
Fishermen and we are
both concerned

74
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,260
about the disturbance of
this Demon of the O cean.

75
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,855
We greatly appreciate for
your help with our country.

76
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:22,697
I understand.

77
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,514
That's right, I...

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,190
You've come to?

79
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:50,521
Y Yeah...

80
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:53,831
Hey, you're the girl
from yesterday...!

81
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,425
I get it now!

82
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,197
You saved me, thank you!

83
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,970
It just happened...

84
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,802
No, seriously you saved me.

85
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:08,003
Oh, I'm Naruto Uzumaki.
What's your name?

86
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:09,970
Isaribi.

87
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:14,074
So Isaribi, you're the girl
who saved my life.

88
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,116
Why did you come to
this remote area?

89
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,326
A mission, of course!

90
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:27,359
To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean
that has been troubling this country!

91
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,395
It would be best to quit.

92
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:33,762
You won't get away easily if you get
involved with the Demon of the Ocean.

93
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:38,404
You don't need to worry.
Anyway, this is a mission.

94
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:40,368
We were careless yesterday,

95
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,913
but next time we'll catch that
Demon of the Ocean!

96
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:43,879
That's hot!

97
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:47,014
So... you feel fine now?

98
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:51,053
Yep! Thanks to you,
it's excellent, believe it!

99
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:53,353
Then, once you've eaten that,
get out.

100
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:54,852
Huh?

101
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:56,719
What? What?

102
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:09,999
Wait, Isaribi!

103
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:12,171
Hey!

104
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,575
Isaribi... Wait...

105
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:17,004
Huh, wha...?

106
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,572
Monster! Go away!

107
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,173
What's this?

108
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,978
It's the work of some brats
from the village.

109
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,182
If I let it bother me,
there's no end to it.

110
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,718
Oh, Isaribi...

111
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,161
Really, thank you so much.

112
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:41,836
She's out, the monster!

113
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,936
What the...?

114
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,008
Get out of here!

115
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:45,304
You're bad luck

116
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,401
Take this!

117
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:48,936
I Isaribi...

118
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,341
Stop it, brats!

119
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:52,174
- Disappear!
- Get out of here!

120
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,240
Say something!

121
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,860
Hey, stop! All of you!

122
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,619
You're taking your pranks
a little too far!

123
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,991
Who are you?!
A friend of this monster?!

124
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:10,567
Monster?

125
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,033
Everyone's saying it.

126
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:13,797
Isaribi was spirited away

127
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:16,670
and became friends with
the Demon of the Ocean!

128
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,708
Don't say such irresponsible things!

129
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:19,769
It's true!

130
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,209
Ouch!

131
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,143
- Run!
- Stupid guy!

132
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,510
- Hey! Who you calling stupid?!
- Stop!

133
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:26,946
What?! But...

134
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:29,551
It's okay...

135
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:32,152
Leave me alone.

136
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,457
I can't leave you alone!

137
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,454
If they keep doing that...

138
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,428
I'm saying that it's none
of your business!

139
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,959
I'm the girl who was
spirited away.

140
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,161
So it's natural that people
find me creepy.

141
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:51,470
But that's not your fault!

142
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:53,074
That doesn't matter.

143
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,071
Humans don't let those who
are different from them

144
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,843
into their group.

145
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:00,081
So...

146
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,490
Your colleague was lost at sea...

147
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,892
We thought that if a boat left port
between the evening and morning

148
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,656
maybe they saw something...

149
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:48,157
Sorry, but I don't think
I can help.

150
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,600
Because of
the Demon of the Ocean,

151
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,466
people of this village stay away
from the port at those times.

152
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,168
I see.

153
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,064
He's been spirited away.

154
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:01,106
That Demon of the Ocean
took someone away again.

155
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,511
Mother, don't say such reckless things.

156
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:04,610
Spirited away...

157
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:06,746
I heard that at the port, too.

158
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:10,746
Can you give me details about
this spiriting away?

159
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:14,258
What good will talking
about it do?

160
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:15,221
But...

161
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,054
Please forgive me.

162
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:20,326
This isn't something to be
talked about with outsiders.

163
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:22,561
Can we do something
about that, please?

164
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,837
We came here to exterminate
the Demon of the Ocean.

165
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,867
Exterminate the Demon
of the Ocean?

166
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,799
I see...

167
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,808
For a long time,

168
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,280
there's been a legend among
fishermen on Demon Island.

169
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:38,907
A legend?

170
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,413
Yes, the legend says
don't come near Demon Island,

171
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:44,978
"the island where demons live.

172
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:49,654
Demon Island has always been
a fishing area rich in fish,

173
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:53,129
but there were many hidden reefs
and it was a dangerous marine area...

174
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,262
So everybody obeyed the legend.

175
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,701
But one unusually cool summer
about ten years ago,

176
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,830
the fish disappeared from the sea...

177
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,509
We couldn't help it,

178
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:07,511
so my husband and I set our feet
into the dangerous marine area.

179
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:11,981
It was a large catch.

180
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:16,643
But when I happily came
to the surface of the ocean,

181
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,248
I saw an empty boat with
my husband nowhere to be seen.

182
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,283
Ever since then, one after the next,

183
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,592
anyone who approaches
that island disappeared.

184
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:30,166
Also, people who went
to search didn't return.

185
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:33,160
Since then people from the village
stay away from the island

186
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,830
where spiriting away occurs.

187
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,768
An island nobody goes near...

188
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,270
That's a peculiar story.

189
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:41,870
Speaking of which, I heard that

190
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:43,812
there's a girl who returned
from being spirited away.

191
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:46,481
Oh, yes... Isaribi.

192
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,548
Ma'am, I've got another favor.

193
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,612
Please tell me where she lives!

194
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,550
Lady Tsunade...

195
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,258
Lady Tsunade!

196
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:01,657
Yes?

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,094
Geez. Here's the data you requested.

198
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:08,365
That's the Land of Sea's...

199
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:10,907
You're worried, after all.

200
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:13,541
Hm... Well, yes...

201
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,341
The Land of Sea is where Anko,
abandoned by Orochimaru, was found...

202
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,497
Hey! Are you okay!

203
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,066
It's no good... I can't remember.

204
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,304
Even though I should know...

205
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,940
It's dark and cold...

206
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,379
I was in pain... But...

207
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:55,811
Calm down...
Try taking a little more time.

208
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:59,724
I'm sure I even got this strange mark
while there...

209
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,691
The suggestion is deep.

210
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,953
Her entire memory is most likely all...

211
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:17,831
That's enough...
You've had some tough times.

212
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:21,743
It's okay.

213
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:26,179
Right now, we'll treat this
Curse Mark that's eating away at you...

214
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,809
We have to do that first.

215
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:29,579
Lord Hokage...

216
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:31,981
I...

217
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,816
In the end, her memory didn't return...

218
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,724
A part of Anko's memory
remains lost even now.

219
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,092
So that's what happened...

220
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:48,263
So, this is the first time Anko's been
to the Land of Sea since that incident?

221
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,573
Yes... That's right.

222
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,843
It would be nice if
it could be a catalyst

223
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,505
for bringing back her memories...

224
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:02,180
What?!

225
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,187
Missed each other?!

226
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,886
They came here?!

227
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,525
Yeah, you should follow
them right away!

228
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,457
And, which way did they go?

229
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:13,359
That way!

230
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,326
That's the direction I came!

231
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,863
Damn! Everybody wait up!

232
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:38,950
<i>The collection ship is moving.</i>

233
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:45,655
I see, the only girl who returned
from being spirited away.

234
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,495
I thought we should at least go see...

235
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:52,526
She may have some information
about Demon Island!

236
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:54,731
Stop!

237
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,212
Oh! That girl!

238
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,140
Sensei!

239
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,909
I wonder where she intends to go?

240
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:16,325
She's cautious.

241
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,556
Let's follow without being noticed.

242
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:38,081
Hey, everybody! Oh, c'mon.

243
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,012
If I keep going like this,

244
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:42,485
I'll go all the way to
Isaribi's house again.

245
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:08,671
That appearance...

246
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,442
It can't be,
you're the Demon of the Ocean...?

247
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:20,816
What?!

248
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,731
I won't let you escape!

249
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:46,907
Master Orochimaru...
This is...?

250
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,145
I'm going to teach you
something special.

251
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:53,952
This is one of the rooms
where I develop Jutsu...

252
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,857
I'd like you to help, too.

253
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,194
But... if the village knew about this...

254
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:04,696
It's not going as smoothly as I hoped.

255
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:07,201
It only needs one more step...

256
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:12,443
Silly, there's nothing to be afraid of.

257
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:18,539
The really frightening thing is
to neglect pursuing the truth.

258
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,250
That girl, could she be...?

259
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:54,581
Give it up! You can't escape!

260
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:57,084
You were the Demon of the Ocean!

261
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:01,921
Hey, everyone!

262
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,725
Hey!

263
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,855
I finally found you!

264
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,168
Naruto, you're safe...

265
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:13,563
But Naruto, you're too late.

266
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,133
Too late?

267
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:19,666
We caught the Demon of the Ocean!
Look, this is it.

268
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,369
Oh! Oh?

269
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,416
Huh, so this is
the Demon of the Ocean?!

270
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:36,925
Isaribi...

271
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:37,823
Huh?!

272
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,999
Isaribi... You're Isaribi, aren't you?!

273
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,030
Naruto! What are you talking about?!

274
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:52,836
Just wait! Isaribi!
Isaribi, answer me!

275
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:55,173
Damn it!

276
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:56,178
Wait up, you!

277
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,612
Wait, don't be rough.

278
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,475
Explanation must wait.

279
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,384
We're in trouble if
we let her escape here.

280
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:20,194
Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!

281
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,336
Like that will happen!

282
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,505
She's an important guinea pig.

283
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:28,377
If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.

284
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,254
Bastard!

285
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,251
Don't chase too far...
It'll be yesterday all over again.

286
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:43,055
But!

287
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,829
Crap!

288
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,668
No question about it...

289
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:01,741
That girl...

290
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:07,881
Sensei!

291
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,523
What in the world is going on?!

292
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:34,343
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

293
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:38,144
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

294
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,750
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

295
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,753
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

296
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,815
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

297
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:50,393
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

298
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,653
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

299
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,529
<i>The images.</i>

300
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:02,539
<i>It probably will not end</i>

301
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:08,935
<i>It probably will not end</i>

302
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:13,785
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

303
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:16,811
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

304
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:19,855
<i>Running freely</i>

305
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:23,485
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

306
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,586
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

307
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:29,565
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

308
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:36,170
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

309
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,442
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

310
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,946
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

311
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,751
Geez! What the heck
are you thinking?!

312
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,417
What do you intend to do alone?!

313
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:57,984
But I can't just leave her be!

314
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,196
Even if you were to go after her,

315
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,629
you don't even have any leads
in the first place!

316
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:02,996
No, not quite!

317
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:03,930
- What?!
- What?!

318
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:07,528
It seems there's an island at
the center of this land's spiriting away.

319
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,163
I get it. Demon Island!

320
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,108
Let's go after her! As for me,
I can't just leave her be, believe it!

321
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:16,203
Next time: "Infiltration: The Set-Up!"
