2
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:39,916
The mission begins.

3
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:46,460
Start of the Konoha-Kuzushi (Crush the Leaf)

4
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:57,814
Hokage-Sama!

5
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,145
Leave him to us!

6
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:04,279
Kazekage-dono... What're you starting?

7
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,598
Hokage-Sama!

8
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,172
Team I is up there, Team Ro is
down there. Protect the Daiymo's.

9
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:30,515
Get out of my way!

10
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:51,774
Hokage-sama, please get away from here...

11
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,697
It's finally my turn to play.

12
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,781
That was boring doing Henge for a long time.

13
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,688
You guys stink like sweat.

14
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,304
Stop it. You guys are teammates, right?

15
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,740
Oto-nin (Sound Ninjas)

16
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:35,415
Raido was... We're going to protect Hokage-sama. Move out!

17
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:37,738
Do it.

18
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,098
Ninpo Shishi Enjin (Four Point Purple Fire Shield)

19
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,651
Damn it... That's Kekkai (area protection jutsu).

20
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,454
That's Kekkai Ninjutsu, I see.

21
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:17,080
They aren't regular level because
they could outwit (outrun) the ANBU.

22
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,622
What're you doing! Hokage-sama's in a critical situation.

23
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,878
I give it to them...

24
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,943
Who'd think that our enemy turned himself into one of ANBU.

25
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,081
I guess he must be the one who used the Genjutsu.

26
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,859
Right. He must be the one.

27
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:51,685
I never thought the Sand would betray the Leaf.

28
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:57,567
A treaty is like a disguise to catch the other off guard.

29
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,772
The stupid match games will end now.

30
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:04,563
From this point on, history shall change.

31
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:09,888
Are you saying you're going to start something like a war?

32
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,853
That's right.

33
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:19,060
You should avoid resorting to force
and seek a resolution with dialogue.

34
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:23,671
It's still not too late, Kazekage-dono.

35
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,674
I wonder if a person would really
know only peace as they get older...

36
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,207
Sarutobi Sensei

37
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:38,767
You are...

38
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,114
I'm out of luck because I have watch duty on a day like this.

39
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:55,565
Me too, I wanted to go see the Chunin exam.

40
00:05:55,852 --> 00:06:01,574
Stop complaining. There're two Chunin exams each
year. You'll have plenty of chances to see it.

41
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:10,246
But this time, that Uchiha kid is in it. Having to
miss that match is one thing I'll regret if I die.

42
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:13,031
What was that?

43
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:31,249
It's time now. Begin!

44
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,809
The summoning has succeeded.

45
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,590
Large snakes...

46
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,911
Go report to Hokage-sama ASAP!

47
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,545
I won't let you come into the village!

48
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:21,882
Hurry up and go get reinforcements!

49
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:22,821
Yes, sir!

50
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:36,819
Suna Nin (Sand Ninjas)

51
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:43,206
What the heck is this?

52
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:45,138
Stop it, Gaara!

53
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,357
I'm gonna kill him!

54
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:54,256
There's no reason to fight with him any further!

55
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,966
Don't forget about our orders!

56
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,462
Get out my way!

57
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,166
What're you guys doing here?

58
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:05,096
The plan has already started.

59
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:21,993
What's going on?

60
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,001
What's wrong?

61
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,660
His wound is deeper than I thought.
Plus, he has consumed lots of chakra.

62
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,440
Then, he won't be able to use "that".

63
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,071
It's impossible to do it so soon.

64
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:45,122
Idiot. That's what you get for trying to turn into
the complete form without waiting for the order.

65
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,560
What are we supposed to do now? Are you
gonna tell us to do it without Gaara?

66
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:02,858
Where's Gaara?

67
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:15,928
Gaara is the ace of the Sand. We
need him working no matter what.

68
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,376
You guys get out of here for now, and treat his wound.

69
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:25,095
As soon as Gaara's chakra has recharged,
we'll carry out the plan again.

70
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,552
Understood.

71
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,800
How about you, Sensei?

72
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,459
I'll hold them here.

73
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,135
You think everything will go by your plan?

74
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,086
I will make it happen.

75
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:58,098
Go!

76
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:10,848
Is Orochimaru hosting this party?

77
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:17,453
I don't know. But, let's have fun for the time being.

78
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,822
Sorry, but the Chunin exam ends now.

79
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:39,058
You're already at Chunin level. If you're a
Shinobi of Konoha, make yourself helpful for Konoha.

80
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,647
So, you're saying that I should beat up
Gaara... like the continuation of the match.

81
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,556
Don't get in too deep. It's real, not an exam, from now.

82
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,708
The things that needs to be done is still the same.

83
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:55,626
I won't let you go!

84
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:18,817
Oh well... I was planning to take Sasuke-kun
while Gaara started doing his stuff.

85
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:23,718
But I guess everything won't be the way I planned.

86
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:28,416
I see. I get it.

87
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:34,705
Konoha and Sasuke are your purpose.

88
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:38,101
Whether Konoha is actually worth that much...

89
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:45,972
Put that aside. If our Gaara can become fully awake,
then I can show you a much more interesting thing, but...

90
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:55,066
Anyway's, your stupidity forced Konoha
into this situation. This is my victory.

91
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:59,765
You will not know everything until it's over.

92
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,572
I believe that's how I taught you....

93
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,342
Orochimaru.

94
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:24,190
I knew that someday, a day like this would come, but...

95
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:29,503
it's not so easy to get my head.

96
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:36,539
I told you this... you'd better decide the Fifth soon...

97
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:43,150
because you, the Third, will die here today!

98
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:06,907
I wonder what's going on with the Chunin
Exam... Is Naruto's match already finished?

99
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,969
I remember that his first match is against Neji.

100
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:14,050
I want him to win it somehow...

101
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:18,169
No! no! no! It's not good that a
teacher cheers for only one student!

102
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,026
Everybody loves the graduates of this
academy. I have to cheer for everybody equally!

103
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,984
But, after all, I want Naruto to win.

104
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,803
Are you anxious about Naruto?

105
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes, Of course!

106
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:38,749
As I thought.

107
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,371
You guys...

108
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,848
I told you to run ten times around the track!

109
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,449
We finished that already.

110
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:51,120
While you were daydreaming.

111
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,640
With you being like that, it's not gonna be a
good class. We're going to finish early for today.

112
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:03,107
No way! I'm starting the class again now!

113
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,377
What is that smoke?

114
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,634
It's in the direction of Chunin Exam arena.

115
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,488
Isn't it noisy in the East?

116
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,305
I wonder if something is happening.

117
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,277
Damn, Orochimaru.

118
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,314
What do you think? Should we go for reinforcement?

119
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:35,122
No. It's dangerous to move when you don't know the situation.

120
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:39,385
It's truer especially when the mastermind is Orochimaru.

121
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:44,594
Is Orochimaru really that dangerous of a guy?

122
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:49,679
He was a student of the Third.

123
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:52,751
So why did he become a
Nuke-nin (runaway-ninja)?

124
00:14:53,501 --> 00:15:02,543
I've heard that he demanded that he should be the one to be the
Hokage, when the decision for the Fourth was made a long time ago.

125
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,195
But his demand wasn't accepted.

126
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:14,711
A little after that, he ran away from this Village. He
probably has a grudge against the Third because of that.

127
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,224
Revenge.

128
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,172
Most likely.

129
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:27,178
When I was still a kid, I thought
only one thing when I saw him.

130
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:38,695
It's like he was not a human, but
something that form looks like a human...

131
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:46,412
It's scary... it's just scary.

132
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:53,415
Report. Large snakes have appeared
near the West Gate of Konoha.

133
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,310
Followed by an invasion of about one hundred Sand ninja's.

134
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,756
Currently, shinobis who're guarding
near there are fighting against them.

135
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:02,745
Sand, eh...

136
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,625
Leave Team 1 and 2 here... the rest go to the West Gate. Hurry!

137
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:09,533
Yes, sir!

138
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,939
I won't let you pass here!

139
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,873
That's a lot of them...

140
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,675
We were careless... Plus even Hokage-sama...

141
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,118
Kakashi, look inside of the Kekkai.

142
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:50,425
What is it?

143
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:07,005
Why is he here? Is he trying again for Sasuke-kun?

144
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,951
What? Sasuke-kun isn't there anymore.

145
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:32,342
Sakura, stay like that for a bit.
I'll reduce the number of enemies.

146
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,248
Damn it... I'm worried about Hokage-sama.

147
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:14,071
Leave it to the ANBU. Plus Hokage-sama
is not a person who's easily killed.

148
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,089
But...

149
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,313
After all, he is the Hokage of the Hidden Konoha.

150
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,989
Is it that much fun to shed a tear?

151
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:45,768
Or do you have a heart to feel a little
bit of sadness to kill me, your teacher?

152
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:48,498
No.

153
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,914
I was sleepy... but I finally woke up now.

154
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:14,030
I knew it was something like that.

155
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:23,053
I knew you're not a man who makes a move based on hate.

156
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:26,848
You have neither purpose nor motivation.

157
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:35,253
Well, I have something you can call
a purpose... If I put it in a word...

158
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:43,933
It's fun to watch things that
move. It's not fun if they're still.

159
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:54,259
A windmill that's not turning isn't worth watching,
even though it's a good atmosphere sometimes.

160
00:19:55,475 --> 00:20:02,486
I want to turn the windmill with
a wind called Konoha Kuzushi now.

161
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,951
You haven't changed.

162
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,335
It was worth it teaching you Genjutsu during the
Survival training for deciding if you pass for the Genin.

163
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:35,027
You have the talent for Genjutsu, as I thought.

164
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:40,110
Release the Genjutsu, and wake Naruto and Shikamaru up.

165
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:50,303
Naruto's gonna be happy. It's going
to be a mission after a long time.

166
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,084
A mission?

167
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,206
Begin with care.

168
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,265
It's the first A-rank mission after the Wave country mission.

169
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,550
Alright! I've been waiting for this!

170
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:53,547
