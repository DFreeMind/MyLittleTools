It is not the answer that I expected,

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,850
Tsunade.

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,640
As you can try to kill to me!

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,290
In any case Kabuto thanks,

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,760
For your loyalty and your ability to discover the attack of Tsunade…

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,000
S ì,

34
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,480
there are all two trains you to the same medical techniques,

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,890
I have been able to perceive the flow of Chakra that used.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,550
Tsunade,

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,490
I was serious when I spoke about their resurrezione.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,870
All the also my promise not to destroy Konoha.

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,670
Orochimaru,

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,840
I have understood that mentivi for Konoha…

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,440
I knew…

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,130
I knew…

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,780
I wanted…

44
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,400
See again them…

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,060
Just a last time.

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,880
A last time only, I wanted see again them…

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,860
Just a last time…

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,360
I wanted to touch…

49
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,640
Just a last time…

50
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,040
Their aces.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,960
But,

52
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,820
I have realized, in the moment in which I have tried this feeling on my skin that see again Nawaki and Dan…

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,530
I have comprised…

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,690
That they have been stupid!

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,680
All and two…

56
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,190
The simple one to remember itself of their aces overwhelmed to me already.

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,350
Sorellina!

58
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,400
Tsunade.

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,670
I loved them…

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,430
So a lot.

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,010
Here why…

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,100
I wanted to see them and to embrace them of new!

63
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,800
But,

64
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,540
I have not been able.

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,110
I will not lose  this bet!

66
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,480
Thanks to this child…

67
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,840
They are remembered to me of their dreams…

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,930
Those dreams that I wanted to forget.

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,470
Konoha is the treasure of the Grandfather!

70
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,010
And  the proteggerò!

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,010
Because they are the grandson of Primo Hokage!

72
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,890
I love so much this village and its inhabitants.

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,300
And for that I want proteggerli.

74
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,720
I  will become  like my grandfather;

75
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,220
And  I will receive  the title it of Hokage!

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,200
They are not like you!

77
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,310
I will strain myself  in order to receive the title it of Hokage!

78
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,330
The dead women of my sister…

79
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,560
It is  the single reason for which I go ahead.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,130
Here why I want to become Hokage!

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,820
In order protect all.

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,770
Because to become Hokage it is my dream!!!

83
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,520
All and two have sacrificed their life in order to realize their dream…

84
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,520
And the possibility to see a day this dream to come true itself is vanished under my eyes.

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,470
"All  that  that takes shape extinguishes a day."

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,410
You said a day.

87
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,380
But…

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,950
This memory is one what that…

89
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,840
It will not be never extinguished!

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,300
I suppose that the agreement…

91
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,860
It is not more valid…

92
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,270
It would seem that we must force to you to cure to me.

93
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,000
Episode #93
The end of negotiates!!

94
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,270
Hey!

95
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,410
Orochimaru!!!

96
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,760
If us task, memory to me is not never struck against of she.

97
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,510
Damned!

98
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,790
As you say, they are the solo to being able to fight against she.

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,790
You! Insignificant refuse!

100
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,000
I will kill  to you  here and now!

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
If it hits to us with its incredible force…

102
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,400
with a single blow it would be the end for we.

103
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,020
Thanks but I had understood it.

104
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,170
One would say that to strike itself around to the castle…

105
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,560
It is complicated.

106
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,240
Tasks that would have to go elsewhere?

107
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,220
S ì  task that is better.

108
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,250
There is also an other person…

109
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,480
with the girl who accompanies Tsunade-sama.

110
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,600
Chissa when it is made alive.

111
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,090
You die!

112
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,100
About who it speaks?

113
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,500
It is  a Sannin like you and Tsunade-sama.

114
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,670
Jiraiya.

115
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,070
Lascerò  not to scappare  to you!

116
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,830
Che cos' is happened!

117
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,990
Watched this casino…

118
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,680
Sure it is work of Tsunade.

119
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,370
That  wants to say that…

120
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,770
Tsunade-sama has refused?

121
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,460
Where has gone that Old one of Tsunade?

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,930
This is… of Tsunade-sama…

123
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,570
Ton-Ton, from that it leave?

124
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,910
Much good!

125
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,720
One would say that Tsunade is losing breath.

126
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,120
Slowly.

127
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,660
They are not much Bravo in the Taijutsu.

128
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,450
"Hyourougan "?

129
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,450
[ Pill of the Soldier ]

130
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,120
Those seal are…

131
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,100
This boy uses "Irou the Ninjutsu "?

132
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,100
[ Technical Doctor ]

133
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,780
My muscles!

134
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,080
I have hit your abdominal biceps and muscles.

135
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,080
Hour you cannot more use your incredible force.

136
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,180
It uses the chakra?

137
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,940
Why you have not hit directly my arteries?

138
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,060
This is true, could divide your body, could have cut all muscles and it is gone sanguinei.

139
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,810
But during a combat, I do not have the time to go so much in depth.

140
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,510
But in any case, if touch your neck, would be the end for you!

141
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,550
Merda!

142
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,430
My lungs!

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,040
I cannot more breathe!

144
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:45,990
This boy…

145
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,060
It is not a normal school ninja.

146
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,040
It is  better than me as far as the techniques and the movements!

147
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,760
Unfortunately I cannot kill to you now.

148
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,650
I have not attacked the neck, you cannot yourselves be moved.

149
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,340
It is  extraordinary!

150
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,240
It would have to suffocate and to try to resume the air…

151
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,280
However…

152
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,740
It would seem that it must carry it…

153
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,600
In life end!

154
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,490
I do not succeed to move my arm…

155
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,900
and my leg…

156
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,030
One does not move!

157
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,700
Impossible!

158
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,870
In this situation, is all the force that I succeed to use?

159
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
But sure…

160
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,450
This was not a simple fist…

161
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,980
But a nervous attack!

162
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,280
It seems to have comprised…

163
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,380
This is, a nervous attack!.

164
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:34,840
I have converted chakra in current the electrical worker, that I have made to flow in its nervous system!

165
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,150
The brain and the body communicate through mark them electrical workers.

166
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:51,820
Tsunade has disturbed this flow of marks them, sending of the current in the 360 points of its nervous system.

167
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,050
After much time without to strike itself, is this the power of a legendario Sannin?

168
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,850
The cures consume a lot chakra…

169
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,780
But I do not have other choice…

170
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,310
When I try to move my right hand…

171
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,010
My left leg that moves.

172
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,830
When I try to move my left leg…

173
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,420
My left shoulder moves.

174
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:49,330
E' like if 80% of my body did not answer more correctly.

175
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,580
This technique… I can move!

176
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,430
Not lowered the guard!!!

177
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,640
How?

178
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,810
As  it can  move in this state!

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,990
You have fear of the blood?

180
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,170
Ve I will show  it  endured!

181
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,900
Jiraiya?

182
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,120
Last E' much time, Jiraiya.

183
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,620
Orochimaru, always this matto look from.

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,090
Ka.... Kabuto-saint!

185
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,880
Naruto-kun.

186
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,460
I see, that already you know yourselves

187
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,900
We have supported with the examination of Chuunin.

188
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,430
Why six, here Kabuto-saint one?

189
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,230
It moves to you!

190
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,050
I  of he will take care.

191
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,030
Even if you can move…

192
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,920
Your body is not to the maximum!

193
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,430
Therefore you cannot move as you would want!

194
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,120
I will not allow  you  to scappare!

195
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,750
Too much late!

196
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,150
It seems that my movements are return to you normal.

197
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,120
Blood…

198
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,150
To have to face two Sannin is too much dangerous.

199
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,050
I must stop of… one now!

200
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,000
Tsunade-Sama!

201
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,310
Hey, Hey! What is happening?

202
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,070
Why Kabuto-saint and the Old Tsunade…

203
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,450
Six too much weak person, Naruto-kun.

204
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,160
Here why you will not be able to defeat Sasuke-kun.

205
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,660
Its watches well coprifronte.

206
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,210
It is a servitore of Orochimaru.

207
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,040
S ì.

208
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,340
I was a spy of the village of the sound.

209
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,160
About what it is speaking?

210
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,870
This must be one lie… Kabuto-saint.

211
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,990
During the examination of Chuunin, you have taught many things to us, and you have to us also saves to you.

212
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,700
It was only in order to collect information on you.

213
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,380
Naruto-kun, from your data, is rendered me account.

214
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,620
You do not have the stoffa for being a ninja.

215
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,650
Six different from Sasuke-kun.

216
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,100
This is before the time that I see Tsunade-Sama in this state.

217
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,950
Ve I pray some found again the calm.

218
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,210
I will take  cure of you.

219
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,210
Tsunade the Old one…

220
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,510
Not to watch to me with that frightening face…

221
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,870
Not six small and graceful other that a genin.

222
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,630
Six single fort thanks to the monster that is in you…

223
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,890
But of forehead to a Leggendario Sannin…

224
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,370
Not six nothing.

225
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,800
Six like a small bug…

226
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,170
and if you interfere…

227
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,940
I will kill  to you!!!

228
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,950
Detention, Naruto!!!

229
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,710
My body is still…

230
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,010
It cannot  use its right hand.

231
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,390
Kage Bunshin not Jutsu!

232
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,500
If we attack it all in the same moment,  I will break off  its defense, and I will crush  it!

233
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:51,860
Why you!

234
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,770

235
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,290

236
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,110

237
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,110
[ Needles ]

238
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,190
I have still not recovered the use of all my senses!

239
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,100
I cannot move!!!

240
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,600
Lacked!

241
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,690

242
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,190
Thanks.

243
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,870
This is…

244
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,820
A pill that coagulates the blood.

245
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,120
A pill that coagulates the blood?

246
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,530
It is  in order to recover from the blood that it has lost?

247
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,750
This boy…

248
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,280
He is  like me, ninja a doctor.

249
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,660
He would say himself that he bleeds very, Kabuto.

250
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,330
Orochimaru-sama…

251
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,400
You want to remove the handwraps from your left arm.

252
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,250
Therefore Orochimaru is he…

253
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,610
It seems that it is the hour sfoggiare some of our abilities…

254
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,430
Shizune.

255
