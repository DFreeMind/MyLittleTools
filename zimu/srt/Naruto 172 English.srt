1
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,580
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:26,390
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,021
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:31,622
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,228
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:46,146
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:55,517
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:06,298
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:15,775
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,905
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,912
Ah, which way is it?!

12
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,121
There's a faint scent of salt water...

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,357
We were almost there...

14
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,496
Then I'll use
my Rasengan to...

15
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,934
Wait! If it doesn't go well,
we'll be crushed under the ceiling.

16
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,733
If so, what should we do?!

17
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,931
Everyone, step backward.

18
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,306
What?!

19
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,117
Phew, we're safe!

20
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,452
Anko Sensei!

21
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:46,424
Let's get moving...
It's already morning.

22
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:47,963
Oh no!

23
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:49,995
The ships collecting funds
are in danger...!

24
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,367
We've got to follow them
right away!

25
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,071
With that ship!

26
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:56,337
Okay, let's go!

27
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,573
You've had no contact
from the Ninja of the Leaf Village?

28
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,484
They were told to
accompany the ship.

29
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,779
What in the world happened?

30
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,523
Captain, we just received
communication.

31
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,194
I see!

32
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,261
That's what I expect
from elite Ninja!

33
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:20,996
It seems they finished

34
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,764
the suppression of
the Demon of the Ocean last night.

35
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,232
- Oh...
- Oh!

36
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,908
Excellent...
So now the ships are safe.

37
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,338
Of course.
Men, take your positions!

38
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,974
We'll depart.

39
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:44,082
<i>Despair. A Fractured Heart</i>

40
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,690
Be careful of the reef!

41
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,659
I don't see any ships that look like
those that collect funds in the port.

42
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,000
How could they depart without us?

43
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,038
Have they already fallen
into Amachi's scheme...?

44
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,419
C Captain Hitode...

45
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,026
What happened?!

46
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,489
There's something there!
The bottom of the ship...!

47
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,575
Confirm the enemy!

48
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:37,612
R-Roger!

49
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:41,876
Huh? What?

50
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,314
Full toward port!

51
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,051
I can't steer!

52
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,322
What?

53
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,772
It's no good. It won't move.

54
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,103
We're going to hit, everyone.
Grab onto something!

55
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,296
This must be the attack from
the Demon of the Ocean?

56
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,335
Thank you for working hard
for transporting the funds.

57
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,633
I saw you while ago!

58
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,137
Identify yourself!

59
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,109
If you hand this ship over
without resistance,

60
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,946
I will save your life.

61
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,240
Don't mess with me!

62
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,862
- It's the Demon of the Ocean...
- A monster!

63
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,368
Demon Illusion: Fire Jutsu.

64
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,811
Wh What...?

65
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,178
Th That's...

66
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,517
It's fire torture...!

67
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,096
Yoroi, take care of the rest.

68
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,423
What?!

69
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,496
I'm your opponent!

70
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,332
Everyone, hang in there!

71
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,769
Don't be so nasty!

72
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,077
We meet again, weirdo!

73
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:30,149
Excuse me, but I still have
something to ask you.

74
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,810
What are you doing, Isaribi!

75
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,580
Cut it out already!

76
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,551
Keep this up and you'll really turn
into the Demon of the Ocean!

77
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,123
Do it, Isaribi.

78
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:53,303
Your opponent is right here.

79
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,538
You said that Orochimaru left

80
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,545
that research facility
half a month ago...

81
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,245
Where did he go?

82
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,910
I don't know...

83
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,878
Now that you mention it,
Orochimaru had a kid in tow.

84
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:10,587
I heard that the kid is
really excellent, unlike you.

85
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,120
Sasuke Uchiha.

86
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:16,087
Something about you
just wasn't enough.

87
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,029
That's why you were abandoned,
I guess.

88
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:24,703
Isarirbi?!

89
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,043
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

90
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:12,384
Isaribi...

91
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:18,555
I bet you still understand
what I've been saying to you, Isaribi!

92
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,023
Don't you care a bit after
tormenting everyone this much?

93
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,557
No.

94
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:34,374
I think nothing of...
even bringing you down...

95
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,701
That's a lie!

96
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,116
It doesn't matter to me
who gets injured...

97
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,487
or who drowns...

98
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:55,053
I'm satisfied as long as
I can return to being a human!

99
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,998
It's about time to come
to yourself!

100
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:14,947
I understand painfully
enough how you feel...

101
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,782
But... doing that...
It's not good!

102
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:15,971
Isaribi, you saved me.
You have a kind heart!

103
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:39,229
Pretty good for a Medical Ninja.

104
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,335
Shut up!

105
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,999
I'm a little surprised that

106
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,438
you had enough time
to take your eyes off...

107
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,105
D-Damn it!

108
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,083
You're too confident...

109
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,057
You're useless.

110
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,423
How long you think
you'll be doing this?

111
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,385
Amachi...

112
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:10,888
He's just a kid.

113
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:13,092
Why can't you finish him off
right away?

114
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:15,593
Sorry. But...

115
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,700
I can't take it anymore.
Get out of my way!

116
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:23,043
Bring it on.
I'll kill a damn monster like you!

117
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,577
Monster? Me?

118
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,079
That's right!

119
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:30,913
You so easily injure
and kill people.

120
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:33,715
You're a monster wearing
human skin!

121
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,961
Hey! What's so funny!

122
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,690
If so, what then?

123
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,432
I'm not some half monster
like Isaribi...

124
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,929
I'm...

125
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,181
further refined than her and
fully integrated for combat use!

126
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,384
You...!

127
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,178
Amachi...!

128
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:08,681
Get out of my way!

129
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,385
You're an almost dead guinea pig...

130
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:17,824
What are you doing?!

131
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:21,968
Even though we were supposed to dissect
and use her as material for experiments,

132
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,664
we took pity on her and
kept her alive.

133
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,634
But after all,
she's terribly ungrateful and useless.

134
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:34,443
What's wrong... kid?

135
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:40,912
You! You're not only
a monster in body and soul!

136
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,218
In truth, you're scum!

137
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,354
C'mere... I'll play with you.

138
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,928
Bastard!

139
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:51,890
Idiot!

140
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,303
Hah, amateurish...

141
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,334
Not over yet!

142
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,807
Shadow Clone Jutsu

143
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,217
No matter how many times
you come at me,

144
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,221
you'll get the same thing!

145
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,498
Well, what's wrong, little guy?

146
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,363
You're going to come again, huh?

147
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:36,471
Yeah, of course!
Until you change Isaribi back...

148
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,843
I'll come at you again and again.

149
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,045
Water Style:
Great Cannonball Jutsu!

150
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,927
What's wrong,
you're done already?

151
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,861
Give it up already, kid!

152
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,091
I told you!

153
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:08,573
Until I take Isaribi back...

154
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:13,937
I absolutely will not... quit!

155
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,353
Why...

156
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,420
would you go that
far to save me?

157
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,597
I can't keep up with the farce.

158
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:39,905
Come on! Sea Monster!

159
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,774
Do it... Sea Monster!

160
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,889
Hey! Let go of me, you!

161
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:07,797
Let me tell you that almost all of
Sea Monster's body is made of water.

162
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:11,699
You can say it's like
a moving Water Prison Jutsu.

163
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,311
Naruto!

164
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,117
Damn...

165
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,423
You're stupid.

166
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,192
Do you think something
like that will affect it at all?

167
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,166
Do you understand, Isaribi?

168
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,401
I am the only one
who can save you.

169
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,638
Now, finish them off!

170
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:52,409
What's wrong?

171
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,310
You want to turn back into
a human, don't you?

172
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,676
Then do as I say!

173
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:05,486
<i>It's no good...</i>

174
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,665
<i>It's no good...</i>

175
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,769
<i>I can't let Isaribi...</i>
<i>go to...that world...</i>

176
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,924
This feeling...

177
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,846
SEAL

178
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,359
What?! What are these
extraordinary Chakras?

179
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,427
S Sea Monster!

180
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,355
Isaribi...

181
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:55,522
I will <i>never</i> let Isaribi
go over there!

182
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:58,895
What are you...?!

183
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:06,671
Naruto?!

184
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,301
He's the same as you.

185
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,279
Same as me...?!

186
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,113
Yes...

187
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,475
The Nine Tailed Fox Spirit,
who long ago attacked our village,

188
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,577
is sealed inside Naruto.

189
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,254
And there was a time

190
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,792
when everyone in the village
treated him like a monster.

191
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:27,816
And...

192
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:39,239
And even so, he works so hard,
everybody approves of him.

193
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:48,806
<i>I understand painfully enough</i>
<i>how you feel...</i>

194
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>But...doing that...</i>
<i>It's not good.</i>

195
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:57,488
Those words... were true...

196
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,199
Naruto!

197
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,235
You bastard!

198
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,292
<i>The wind blows, Ah...</i>

199
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,093
<i>The pain,</i>
<i>The memories won't disappear</i>

200
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,699
<i>What should be brought along?</i>

201
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,702
<i>Assemble them into a piece.</i>

202
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,764
<i>There is no second chance, never</i>

203
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,343
<i>How foolish it is to throw away</i>

204
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,602
<i>Acting so innocently, Ah...</i>

205
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,478
<i>The images.</i>

206
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,488
<i>It probably will not end</i>

207
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,884
<i>It probably will not end</i>

208
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:13,734
<i>Burn that love filled heart,</i>

209
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,760
<i>Sail across a thousand dreams</i>

210
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,804
<i>Running freely</i>

211
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:23,434
<i>To take hold of the world in hand</i>

212
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,536
<i>The clouds scatter</i>

213
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>The sun sets yet again</i>

214
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:36,120
<i>The solo parade begins to move.</i>

215
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,391
<i>Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,</i>

216
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,896
<i>Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love</i>

217
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:52,802
Oh, I was able to do
the Chief Toad summoning

218
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,238
for the first time in a while!

219
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,808
Now, prepare yourself,
you flabby jerk!

220
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,535
Tomorrow will never come
for you again!

221
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,909
This itches!

222
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,005
What? It's not a good time
to be getting scared now!

223
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:03,549
It really itches.

224
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:06,579
Now, Chief Toad,
take him out good.

225
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:10,821
Naruto, summoning me in
salt water like this!

226
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,788
I could take your life for this!

227
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:13,654
What...?!

228
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,895
Next time: "Battle at Sea:
The Power Unleashed!"
