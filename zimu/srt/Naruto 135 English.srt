1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,883
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:21,479
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,319
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,591
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,796
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:40,171
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:49,140
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,518
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,521
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,889
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,358
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,232
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,972
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,304
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:19,176
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,441
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,983
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,418
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,801
<i>The Promise That Could Not Be Kept</i>

21
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,214
Kakashi Sensei...

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,948
Where's Sasuke?

23
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,420
Kakashi!

24
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,088
How is Naruto Uzumaki's condition?

25
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,827
He's okay.

26
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:18,031
What about Sasuke?
Where's Sasuke Uchiha?!

27
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,550
How are the other Genin?

28
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,356
Yes! By Lady Hokage's order,

29
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,586
the first and second medical corps
have been dispatched...

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
The wounded from all areas have
already been gathered.

31
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,022
They were convoyed after
administering emergency treatment.

32
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,560
How are their conditions?

33
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,433
Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries...

34
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:55,266
Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,
but it's not life threatening.

35
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:59,611
Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi
are in serious condition...

36
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,473
At this point,
there's no telling what will happen.

37
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,225
<i>Everyone...</i>

38
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,683
<i>The ingredients and</i>
<i>effects of the medicine</i>

39
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,722
<i>have been thoroughly researched.</i>

40
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,452
<i>Excellent...</i>

41
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,784
Now bring the deer antler!

42
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:48,721
Yes, ma'am!

43
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,902
How is he... Big Sister?

44
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,436
No walks for him for quite a while...

45
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,504
The muscles of his limbs
have been severely damaged.

46
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,510
You're a vet, right, Big Sister?
Can't you somehow...?

47
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,710
It'll be okay.

48
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:16,320
It'll take time. But there's no threat
to his life, so rest easy.

49
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,287
Walks for you are out of the question
for quite a while, too!

50
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,098
Yeah, I know...

51
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,930
Intensive Care Unit 7

52
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,611
It'll soon be three hours...
Please take over.

53
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:44,883
All right!

54
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,046
Although we're making
this kid's hair into a conductor,

55
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,319
please don't mistake the cellular rate
of the deficient parts!

56
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,853
Right!

57
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,086
As for the Chakra control, handle it
as if we're threading a needle!

58
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,397
Understood!

59
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,669
Intensive Care Unit 6

60
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,146
There's no point in
you getting frustrated, right?

61
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,855
Missions come with sacrifice...

62
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,424
You took the mental training, right?

63
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,264
Training and actual battle
are different, you know...

64
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,434
I know what missions are about...

65
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,598
And I thought I knew what
the Shinobi world is like.

66
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,312
I became a platoon leader
for the first time on this mission.

67
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,379
With that, I understood...

68
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,581
I'm not cut out to be a Shinobi.

69
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:02,187
Surprisingly fragile... for a man.

70
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,162
This time...

71
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,292
The only thing I was able to do
as platoon leader...

72
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,032
was to believe in everyone.

73
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,662
I was nave...

74
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,066
I didn't have enough power...

75
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,302
It's all my fault!

76
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,571
Are you afraid of getting hurt?

77
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,186
Shikamaru...

78
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:41,094
Are you going to be argued down
by a girl and run away?

79
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,668
It's a drag...

80
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,537
I don't want to have arguments.
I'm not a woman.

81
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,242
Yeah... But you're not a man, either.

82
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,112
You're just a coward!

83
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,478
Even if you quit being Shinobi,
the missions will continue.

84
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,418
Someone has to do it.

85
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,488
Your comrades will just
be dispatched again...

86
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,753
under a different platoon leader.

87
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,087
And your comrades might die there.

88
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,864
But if at that time,
<i>you</i> were the platoon leader...

89
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,165
your comrades might be saved
from that happening to them.

90
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,701
If you reflect on this time,
make use of the experience and learn,

91
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,233
you might be able to carry out missions
with more perfection.

92
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,641
If you really think your comrades
are important to you,

93
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:33,209
before you think about running away...

94
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:38,350
think about becoming more exceptional
for the sake of your comrades!

95
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:43,456
That's what real comrades are,
you coward!

96
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,033
Intensive Care Unit 6

97
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,481
He's okay, now!

98
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,252
The antidote has stopped
the death of cells

99
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,783
caused by the side effects of the Pills.

100
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,854
You were a big help this time, Shikaku!

101
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:22,195
The Nara Clan's secret medicinal
preparation manual was very useful.

102
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,905
It must've been tough to
make something like that...

103
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,908
It's the result of day to day study.

104
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,369
Thanks...

105
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,903
Lady Tsunade!

106
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:41,519
Neji Hyugan.
His safety line has been secured.

107
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,855
And, there's some information...

108
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:51,721
Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki
have just now returned.

109
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,393
Although seriously injured,
it seems it's not life threatening.

110
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,111
Two, huh?

111
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,483
Shikamaru...
It seems the mission is a failure.

112
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:21,458
But, everyone is alive!
That's the most important thing.

113
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,463
Next time for sure...

114
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,594
I'll carry out the mission perfectly!

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,556
Sasuke... You're the chosen one.

116
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,890
Whatever... Just give me "power."

117
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,662
Even though the form is different,
it's still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.

118
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,403
If you don't want to die,
use more care in how you talk.

119
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,211
<i>Wh What? This quality of Chakra...</i>

120
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:19,211
<i>Yes... My future is inside this kid...</i>

121
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,249
Hidden Leaf Hospital

122
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,432
<i>I'm going to where Orochimaru is!</i>

123
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,530
<i>Please...bring back Sasuke!</i>

124
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:46,874
<i>I'll bring Sasuke back without fail!</i>
<i>I promise that on my life!</i>

125
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,785
Oh... You were awake, huh?

126
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,357
Shikamaru!

127
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:08,123
I'm going on ahead to Choji!
What about you?

128
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:12,230
I'm going on ahead to...
Naruto and Sasuke!

129
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,769
I see... So everyone's okay.
That's good.

130
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,177
Then, Sasuke...

131
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,588
Yeah... he's gone.

132
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,999
Intensive Care Unit 6

133
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,501
Then, I still can't see him...?

134
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:56,314
Yeah... But Lady Tsunade said that
he should regain consciousness soon.

135
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,785
Thank goodness...

136
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,283
It's really a great help that

137
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,950
Lady Tsunade returned
to the Leaf Village.

138
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,426
If she hadn't, right about now,
Choji would be...

139
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,066
<i>The Lady Fifth...Hokage.</i>

140
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,239
You've come to visit?

141
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,475
Information sure travels fast.

142
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,553
<i>Sakura...</i>

143
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:38,882
Naruto...

144
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,857
I heard you suffered
quite a serious injury...

145
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,368
But you look well, considering.

146
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,607
I'm sorry... Sakura...

147
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,181
Why do you apologize?

148
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,085
Being you, you probably
got reckless again, right?!

149
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,119
Jeez, you look like a mummy...

150
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,896
I'm sorry... I...

151
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:23,229
Hey... The weather's nice today.
So open the curtains.

152
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,965
Sakura! I...

153
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,511
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

154
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,940
I promised on my life.
That's what I said, so I...!

155
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,182
It's okay already, Naruto...

156
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:44,947
Sakura! He...

157
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,583
I always...

158
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,785
said that, so... I...

159
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,456
I stick straight to what I say!

160
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,334
That's my Way of Ninja!

161
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,547
Naruto...

162
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,857
<i>Thanks, Naruto...</i>

163
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,333
<i>I'll get right to healing this injury</i>
<i>and I've got to bring Sasuke back!</i>

164
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,443
Wh What was that?!

165
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,175
Per... Pervy Saget?!

166
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,550
Yo!

167
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,423
I've come today to tell you
something important.

168
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,255
From here on,
as my official disciple,

169
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,322
I'll train you to become
a full fledged Shinobi in three years.

170
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,096
Three years...?

171
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,738
I've received some credible information
from a certain source

172
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,067
concerning the Akatsuki.

173
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,739
<i>Akatsuki...</i>

174
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,840
It seems that it will be
three or four years

175
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,542
before they come after you next.

176
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,847
I don't care about that!

177
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,014
Talking about stuff that's
so far down the road...

178
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,116
I don't have the time
to be doing slowpoke training!

179
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,352
What do you mean?

180
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,497
If I don't go after
Sasuke immediately,

181
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,433
he might be killed by Orochimaru!

182
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,972
<i>"Lmmortal" doesn't mean that</i>
<i>the flesh is being maintained as is.</i>

183
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,942
<i>Before his body decays,</i>

184
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,379
<i>a strong and new flesh will be made</i>
<i>into a vessel for his soul.</i>

185
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,453
It seems you've learned
of the true purpose

186
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,683
for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke...

187
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,759
Huh?! Then that means you also knew?

188
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:06,090
I was looking into
Orochimaru's Immortality Jutsu.

189
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,957
It seems with that Jutsu,

190
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:13,597
he can't reincarnate into
the next body for three years.

191
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:19,271
And unable to wait for Sasuke,
he just recently reincarnated...

192
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:24,045
It'll be okay for three years from now...
There is time.

193
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,017
That's not a lie, is it?!

194
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,213
Not a lie, is it?!

195
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,451
Nope...

196
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,956
However...

197
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,965
Forget about Sasuke...

198
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:50,239
Sasuke went to Orochimaru
on his own accord.

199
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,410
No matter what you do,
he won't change.

200
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,877
I've seen many Shinobi, so I know...

201
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,285
Sasuke is the same kind
as Orochimaru.

202
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:08,526
If you're thinking about bringing him back,
just forget it.

203
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,925
That's something an arrogant fool
would do!

204
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:17,798
He may be nothing to you
but he's my friend!

205
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,539
Would a friend hurt his comrade?!

206
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,838
Take a look at your current plight!

207
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,137
This is...!

208
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,721
Why? Why would you...?

209
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,883
We were called Sannin together...

210
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,984
Weren't we comrades
since we were kids?!

211
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:47,064
In every regard,
you're a foolish guy, Jiraiya...

212
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,261
You lack thought
in everything you do.

213
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:55,407
That's why you didn't notice
what I was doing.

214
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,771
Can't you rethink it, Orochimaru?

215
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,545
Absurd!

216
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,380
How can you be so stupid?!

217
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,813
<i>No matter how much I wanted it...</i>

218
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,191
<i>in the end, there was no way</i>
<i>he would come back.</i>

219
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:17,494
<i>After the agony, all that's left was</i>
<i>my own powerlessness and regret.</i>

220
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:22,593
<i>I don't want you to go through</i>
<i>the same thing...</i>

221
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,209
If you're going to go after Sasuke,
then there'll be no training.

222
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,902
I'll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you

223
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,971
and depending on the case,
prohibit you from leaving the village.

224
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,311
You're not just an ordinary kid...

225
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,414
You possess the Nine Tail Fox.
That the Akatsuki is after!

226
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,257
This is serious.
I'll just have to do that...

227
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,023
if you're going to act on your own
without listening to what I say.

228
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,330
Eventually, you're going to have to deal

229
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,462
with guys more troublesome
than Orochimaru.

230
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,801
Give up on Sasuke.

231
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,737
Sooner or later this was
going to happen.

232
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,539
Don't suffer anymore!
Forget and dismiss him.

233
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,044
It's not just Jutsu or power...

234
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,121
If you're a Shinobi, develop eyes that
can make the right judgment.

235
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,524
And if you're going to live
as a Shinobi, become wise.

236
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,922
If you remain a fool...

237
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,486
the reality is that it will be tough
living in this world.

238
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,092
Fine.

239
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,270
If that's what being wise is...

240
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,637
Then I'm fine being a fool for life!

241
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,569
Even if by myself,

242
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,672
I'll create even more awesome Jutsu
and save Sasuke no matter what!

243
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:46,276
And, and,
I'll even kick the Akatsuki's butt!

244
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,601
If someone like you
were to do it alone...

245
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,432
the best you'd be able
to come up with

246
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,476
would be some
stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.

247
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,008
It might somehow work out

248
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,882
if you are a big fool and
not an ordinary fool...

249
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,122
Be prepared once
you're out of the hospital,

250
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,021
you big fool.

251
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,154
See you then.

252
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,592
Roger!

253
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,206
- It's been seven years since...
...all the members gathered like this.

254
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,176
Since Orochimaru left
the organization.

255
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,173
That Orochimaru has gotten
the Sharingan.

256
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,150
Itachi... Your little brother?

257
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,753
Don't get hasty. Yeah.

258
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,518
We'll kill Orochimaru eventually...

259
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,993
More importantly,
there are only three years left.

260
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,830
Can everyone accomplish
the work required of them?

261
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:06,896
Huh?

262
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,335
Yes, our goal is...

263
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:15,839
to get everything,
including the Nine Tail Fox in question!

264
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,114
<i>When I recalled the parts one by one,</i>

265
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:35,491
<i>I felt as though</i>
<i>I had understood everything</i>

266
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:46,063
<i>Faded words which I kept so close to me</i>

267
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:55,838
<i>Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,</i>

268
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:02,578
<i>and this distant yearning for you</i>

269
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:11,888
<i>I live, simply repeating this cycle</i>

270
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:23,601
<i>Held in my two hands</i>
<i>A droplet of time</i>

271
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:34,043
<i>Softly clutching forgotten memories</i>
<i>Lost words</i>

272
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,797
<i>I'll keep these thoughts...</i>

273
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,972
Sakura's been weird all along
ever since Sasuke left.

274
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,832
I can't put it well,

275
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,707
but she's gloomy or fretting
or something.

276
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,205
On top of that she says,
"This time I'll do my best on my own."

277
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,450
What the heck does that mean?

278
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,950
It's bugging me, it's bugging me!

279
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:12,253
This isn't the time for me
to be relaxing in the hospital!

280
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,257
