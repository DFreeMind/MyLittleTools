1
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,838
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:26,648
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,880
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,486
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:46,404
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:55,775
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:06,556
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:16,033
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:21,163
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:47,194
<i>The Enemy of the Byakugan</i>

12
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:08,311
They blew up...
They blew up and died!

13
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,822
As I expected, I'm not sad.

14
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:15,818
You really can't hold funerals
feeling like this, huh...

15
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,863
Four of them are still alive.

16
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,934
Can't be! After being hit
by my Lightning Fang...

17
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:29,666
No...

18
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,834
If you say so, it has to be true.

19
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,207
One... is troublesome...

20
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:45,120
The enemy was nearby...
But I couldn't see anything.

21
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,025
<i>It's strange...</i>

22
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,227
<i>Even if it's the Hidden Mist Jutsu,</i>

23
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,561
<i>my Byakugan should be able</i>
<i>to see through it.</i>

24
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:55,929
<i>Byakugan!</i>

25
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,459
<i>For sure this time...</i>

26
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,440
<i>I can see it!</i>

27
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,135
<i>Southwest 52 degrees 2!</i>

28
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,010
<i>Southeast 12 degrees 3!</i>

29
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,319
<i>Southeast 8 degrees 1!</i>

30
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:20,255
<i>Northwest 24 degrees 11!</i>

31
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,125
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

32
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:30,466
Let's go!

33
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,672
Leaf Hurricane!

34
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:40,540
No way!

35
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,847
Why?!

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,754
Uzumaki Barrage!

37
00:03:58,298 --> 00:03:59,697
I missed!

38
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,531
H Help me!

39
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,565
Bushy Brow?

40
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,174
Th The enemy disappeared!

41
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:24,113
<i>It can't be...</i>
<i>The false images with Chakra Networks?</i>

42
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,986
One at the middle of the cliff,
one at the bottom of the cliff,

43
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,898
one on the right, one on the left.

44
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,636
We can't hold funerals,

45
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:40,901
but I'll take care of them
without leaving any trace.

46
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,270
Thunder Funeral: Feast of Lightning!

47
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:05,489
The corpses are warm.

48
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,063
We're strong... you and I.

49
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:12,968
No, it's you.

50
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:19,111
Ranmaru, you're strong.
With you I'm also strong.

51
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:24,107
Wait... They aren't dead yet.
They're just unconscious.

52
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,748
They're stubborn.

53
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:30,948
Okay, if grilling doesn't work,
then let's chop them.

54
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:36,157
Flesh and even bone...
I'll crush them nicely.

55
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,798
Ranmaru...! Are you all right?!

56
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,304
Hang in there, Ranmaru!

57
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:51,675
Ranmaru...!

58
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:54,680
I'm okay.

59
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:57,680
Raigan.

60
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,185
This person... is still unconscious.

61
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,845
What did you say?

62
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,623
It's amazing...

63
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,518
He is fighting
only with muscle memory.

64
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:14,394
It's a nice face.
It burns into my heart.

65
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,066
Let's hold a funeral for him...

66
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,964
I am sure it will be one
that will make me cry!

67
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:21,873
From the right!

68
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,042
What's with this guy...?

69
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,105
He's hard to read. The moves...

70
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,379
But for your sake, Raiga,
I'll do my best.

71
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:31,913
Together, okay!

72
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:32,741
Left!

73
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,444
Right!

74
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,111
From the front! Jump! Now!

75
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,693
You... you... you!

76
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:43,719
What?

77
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,195
How can this guy...
get to this point?

78
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,605
B-Bushy Brows...

79
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,716
<i>Lee...</i>
<i>Could he have lost consciousness... ?

80
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:15,824
Tenten! Neji!

81
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,165
Raiga! Turn around!

82
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,341
What...? That voice right now...?

83
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:33,278
Wha-?!

84
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,773
Raiga!

85
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,146
Ranmaru!

86
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:38,679
This is...

87
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:39,510
Neji...

88
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:40,984
Ranmaru!

89
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:41,710
Move!

90
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:47,986
Huh? Somehow... it felt like
I was fighting in my dreams...

91
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:51,520
Ranmaru...

92
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,127
You!

93
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,699
Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives!

94
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,445
Naruto...

95
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,873
Just die already...

96
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:12,145
Hey! I have something
I want to ask you!

97
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:16,010
You... I heard you're one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

98
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,826
So what if I was?!

99
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,053
You know Zabuza, right?!

100
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,065
You also know...
one called Kisame, right?!

101
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,975
I... hate them!
Who wants to remember them?!

102
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:38,971
I hate you too!

103
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:40,707
Then!

104
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,771
I'll make you tell me by force!

105
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,317
A clone?!

106
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,979
You... You're weaker
than a moment ago.

107
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:55,985
Wh What...?

108
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,527
Lightning Ball!

109
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:07,534
Damn...

110
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,031
Huh, you are tough...

111
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,875
Lightning Ball!

112
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,382
Seconds, please...

113
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,074
Grandma Sansho?

114
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,606
What's wrong?

115
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,614
Oh my. That's bad lightning.

116
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:55,116
It was flashing like that too when
Karashi went to the village.

117
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,186
Oh my... that light is like poison...

118
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:05,929
Naruto!

119
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,573
It's not... working at all.

120
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:24,941
I'm not going to
remember your smile!

121
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:25,809
Die!

122
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,288
Ranmaru... where are you?

123
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,522
What is in this bag...?

124
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:38,057
Byakugan!

125
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,261
There's... in here...

126
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,906
Could it be?

127
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:04,988
This powder was...
hiding the Chakra Networks?

128
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,094
It's even creating the Chakra Network!

129
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,537
Naruto!
Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

130
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,611
But he saw all the shadow clones...

131
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,004
Don't worry.
His eyes are right here!

132
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:35,381
Ranmaru! I'm gonna come save you
after I defeat this guy!

133
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,346
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

134
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,090
Come bring it on!

135
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:46,692
Lightning Ball!

136
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,826
What? Was the one before a lucky hit?

137
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,165
Stop messing around.
All I have to do is defeat you all, right?!

138
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:57,239
Let's go!

139
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,173
We're not done yet!

140
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,504
You...

141
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,412
<i>At this rate...my Chakra will...</i>

142
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,988
<i>The mist...</i>
<i>The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away...</i>

143
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:13,286
<i>Damn! I'll finish them off at once!</i>

144
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:15,686
Damn!

145
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,866
I am not going to let you get away!

146
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,600
Wait!

147
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,436
Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche.

148
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,041
Naruto!

149
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,218
Naruto...

150
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:50,727
Did you see that?!

151
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:51,922
Yeah, I saw it!

152
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,590
Prepare yourself!

153
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,056
Stop it!

154
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:00,730
I can't stop!

155
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:12,208
I... did it.

156
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,554
This is... Raiga's eye...?

157
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,182
Such a big eye ball!

158
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,158
Huh?

159
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,056
You're wrong...
It's a human being!

160
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:29,623
Huh?!

161
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:32,935
In my dream...

162
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:36,202
I guess you were the one
I was fighting against.

163
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,606
It wasn't me...
It was Raiga and me together...

164
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,007
Together...?

165
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,714
Always... since that time...

166
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:23,615
Don't act like you're asleep.
You are going to die...

167
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,087
Don't move!

168
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,986
There is a spy in this village
who snuck into the Hidden Mist Village...

169
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,089
We came to kill those guys, but...

170
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:41,238
I got confused about who I had to kill.
That's why I am doing it randomly...

171
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,235
Wh What are you saying?

172
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,981
It's fine...
If I am going to be killed by you.

173
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,454
Huh...?
Why is it fine for me to kill you...?

174
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:02,289
You were... always crying...

175
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,326
Huh? Me... cry?

176
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,033
In your heart...
seeking the meaning of living.

177
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:16,605
I was always watching... you.

178
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,612
What... are you?

179
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:26,346
I am the same as you...
living is painful.

180
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:28,977
I don't understand
the meaning of living.

181
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:32,381
Because of my sickness,
I couldn't go outside...

182
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,656
Shunned by everyone,

183
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,594
all I could do was to take
a peek of the world from this blanket...

184
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,796
But... if with my death,

185
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:45,963
if you are able to feel
the meaning of life even a little...

186
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,833
My life was not needed
from the beginning.

187
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:56,104
Please...

188
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,952
Are you... alone?

189
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,183
Come with me.

190
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:14,656
From now on,
you and I are two as one.

191
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:25,137
From that day on,
I became Raiga's eyes and ears.

192
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,846
Raiga became my hands and feet.

193
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,149
The outside world that I dashed
into for the very first time...

194
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:45,492
it was filled with things
I had never seen or heard before.

195
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:48,160
It was fun.

196
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,970
Whenever and wherever,
I was with Raiga.

197
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,600
No matter when it was,

198
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:01,373
there wasn't a time
that we were separated.

199
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:35,274
We were trying to find the meaning of life
by living for each other.

200
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,815
We were convinced that
was the meaning to living.

201
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,190
That's why...

202
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:52,860
If Raiga is not around,

203
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:56,025
I no longer have the power
to live by myself.

204
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,397
I've lost the purpose to live...

205
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,903
Do you have someone
precious to you?

206
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:08,646
I want to protect
someone important to me...

207
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:13,211
I want to make his dream come true,
and that's my dream.

208
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:19,183
Often people have it wrong...

209
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,589
mistakenly believing that showing mercy
to an enemy is kindness.

210
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,223
They spare the foe
whose life is in their hands.

211
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,965
It's not mercy to me at all...

212
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:43,371
Do you know the agony of just living
without dreams and being unwanted?

213
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,883
What are you saying?

214
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:54,620
Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.
You've taken away my reason for living.

215
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,226
I no longer need to live.

216
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,897
Don't say such stupid things.

217
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:10,831
Naruto... Please kill me!

218
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:11,608
Huh?

219
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,445
What are you doing?

220
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,841
Now, quickly.

221
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,184
Why are you hesitating...?

222
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:28,058
With my arms and legs torn apart,
I have no means to resist, you know.

223
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:34,597
You should carry out your mission...

224
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,125
Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.

225
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,770
Our mission is to force out
the Kurosuki Family from this village...

226
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,941
Without Raiga, he cannot be
of any threat to this village.

227
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,450
The problem right now is that

228
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,217
the Kurosuki Family members
have lost their leadership.

229
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,422
Once the hoop comes off,
we don't know what they will do.

230
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:12,362
For this mission...
this is the finishing touch.

231
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,939
Yeah, but what are we
going to do with him?

232
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,721
Is he a villain worth tying up?

233
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:32,546
No, he is not.

234
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:35,322
He might kill himself, right?

235
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:40,026
Once the mission is over,
we will come save you right away...

236
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,672
A Chakra Sealing tag?

237
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:52,504
We can't help it.
He is an enemy, after all...

238
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:58,139
We should assume he has other Jutsu.
Just in case!

239
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:41,352
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

240
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:52,930
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

241
00:21:53,672 --> 00:22:04,241
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

242
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:16,426
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

243
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:27,870
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

244
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:39,415
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

245
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:45,179
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

246
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,960
Rokusuke and the others
went back to the village,

247
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,362
so I say the mission is complete.

248
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:55,457
Ex. Cept Lee.

249
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,523
Oh, oh yeah.

250
00:22:56,601 --> 00:23:00,002
Bushy Brow said he was
going to straighten Karashi's spirit.

251
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:02,164
I wonder if it's going to be
that easy.

252
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,502
It seems like
there will be some trouble.

253
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,406
Hey, why are you saying that?!

254
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:09,004
No, not Karashi, but this weather.

255
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,912
Nex. T episode:
"The Dark Creeping,"Clouds

256
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,712
I see. There's going to be a storm.
