One would say that it is scappando. -

39
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,612
Idate always has been this type of boy.

40
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,197
You know well?

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,823

There was from expecting it, Idate is escaped.

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,680
He was expectable, enough to think next to all the problems that it has caused.

45
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,391
E' be an error to authorize it to participate to the race.>.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,976
Race of idiots!

47
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,061
Idate is not that kind of person.

48
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,563
But Head!..

49
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,565
I believe in he.

51
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,320
Jirochou.

52
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,155
Gokaro!?

53
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,784
How counted to resolve this problem?

54
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,833
This historical festivity has taken to a fold ridicule.

55
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,502
It has made in front of your eyes.

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,171
Gokaro-sama,

57
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,965
The race as soon as is begun.

58
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,676
You remain to watch it until the end, ve I pray some.

59
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:48,687
If me the been ones asking, mean that you are sure to win.

60
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,231
But if you lose..

61
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,404
Your clan will be destroyed.

62
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:58,989
I accept.

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,532
They are a word man.

64
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,454
If Idate loses, will be to your service.

65
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,084
Good idea, Jirochou.

66
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,878
Good  solution is one.

67
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,464
I hope that it is to the height of my hopes.

68
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,136
Ripongo my confidence in you, Idate.

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,602
Head…

70
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:32,731
They give all the moneies to me!

71
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,074
You make as you it has been said!

72
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,701
A ladro starved?

73
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,578
You are firm!

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,417
A worm with a knife…

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,882
I bet that you would not succeed not to peel one potato with this.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,182
A gift.>.

77
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,271
The appuntiti objects are not made in order to hurt the persons.

78
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,902
You do not have a place where to be?

79
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,367
Sono Jirochou, head of the Wasabi clan, the Degarashi village.

80
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,660
Wasabi?

81
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,412
Jirochou?

82
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,206
S ì,  you would want to come from me for a po of time?

83
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,460
I do not know nothing of you…

84
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,423
It does not import, a person who is dying of hunger  can  make something of stupid

85
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,425
Not to take it to you

86
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,513
Euh…

87
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,724
It is  a gift.

88
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,184
You hold it.

89
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,730
To leave now, enough with the thefts and the crimes.

90
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,776
Mine.... Getlteman!

91
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:01,862
Ve of supplico!

92
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,488
I want to be your subordinated one!

93
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,074
Not.... You want to accept to me like subordinate, Head!

94
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,161
How it calls to you?

95
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,788
Idate. My name is Morino Idate.

96
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,839
We go, Idate.

97
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,884
Trusted you me, head.

98
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,802
Ce I will make  it!

99
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,144
We are recovering.

100
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,854
But it is too much late.

101
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,482
After to have lost cos ì  a lot to the departure, it does not have more possibility than to recover.

102
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,399
Not.

103
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,819
It had probably previewed all from the beginning.

104
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,795
What!?

105
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,257
Joined E' its hour.

106
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,720
S ì  but…

107
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,516
They always follow in order to escort it.

108
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,601
Still better!

109
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,020
This time, we go to pareggiare the accounts…

110
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,650
Of the Chuunin examination.

111
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,071
Gone ahead.

112
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,948
I withhold them here

113
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,871
We have resumed to you finally!

114
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:34,872
It waits for!

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,250
Ehi! Cursed.... Why you are making this road?

116
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,376
Vattene!

117
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:40,919
They are not transactions yours

118
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,130
But what is that it does not go in you!?

119
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,381
I have said to you to plant it!

120
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,553
You are careful!

121
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,972
But they are not shrewed.>.

122
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,182
of the Genjutsu?

123
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,392
It waits for a moment!

124
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,854
This place…

125
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,024
, it is just a Genjutsu.

126
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,651
Which thing?

127
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,736
In this case…

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,073
Kai!
[ Release ]

129
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:14,661
Laggiù!

130
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,371
Ehi!

131
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,789
It waits for!

132
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,337
But that it happens?

133
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,551
Here made!

134
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,435
Not to move to you.

135
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,687
They withdraw to us on.

136
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,856
What has happened?

137
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,943
It was a double Genjutsu.

138
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,529
Me they are broken.

139
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,405
Race of idiot!

140
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,574
It is  guilt yours if we are here.

141
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,117
But what you are saying!?

142
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,619
Enough! Stopped!

143
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,328
Stopped!

144
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,873
Aaaaaaaah! My crews!

145
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,922
Tzk.. Here your instinct…

146
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,715
Our instinct!

147
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,426
You we have saved the life and ringrazi to us not even.

148
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,096
It is not your mission to help me?

149
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,265
Therefore I do not have ringraziare to you.

150
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:17,975
But ch.>.!?

151
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,184
Detention, Naruto.

152
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,811
What it has said is true.

153
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,481
But if you do not want to die,

154
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,483
You would better make to remain close to we.

155
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,194
Ehi! Where you go?

156
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,405
Not lathes to Degarashi?

157
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:32,990
Idiot.

158
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,992
I head towards north.

159
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:35,868
North?

160
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,412
This road is faster?

161
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,205
Task.

162
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,915
Truly?

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,293
Us  it cannot  be trusted this boy.

164
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,795
Also the Ninja does not serve to nothing.

165
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,634
During the war, a powerful wind  blew  very strongly on the ocean.

166
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,097
On the starting line, watching the movement of clouds, I have understood…

167
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,100
that the wind was arriving.

168
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:05,063
In more, from the port of the north, one marine current heads directly towards the island of Nagi.

169
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,693
E' this the difference between me and you

170
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,828
Is in order to arrive one storm.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,130
Ehi, not to go encounter to the storm!

172
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,049
We have all the time that we want.

173
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,176
We would not have to save our time?

174
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,679
Once it arrives to you on the island, my speed in race will make the rest.

175
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,765
My Victoria is assured!

176
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,350
I have understood.

177
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,358
The wind becomes salato.>.

178
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,528
The sea!

179
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,036
This house is abandoned?

180
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,623
It is  the Tempio Modoroki, is to goal road from the island of Nagi.

181
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,258
In less than an hour, we will catch up the other side.

182
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,467
Waited for a second.

183
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,558
Getlteman, there are. Sono Idate, of the Wasabi clan.

184
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,852
Oh, I waited for to you.

185
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,479
I imagined.

186
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,940
I ask your boat on loan.

187
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,401
Sure.  It is  already ready.

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,444
You take the boat that is laggiù.

189
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,033
It is  my faster boat.

190
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,201
Thanks.

191
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,619
It is  an honor.

192
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,414
It is  also mine it must towards Jirochou.

193
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,667
This is the reason for which I ask you not to lose against the Wagarashi clan.

194
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,588
I do not accept their methods.

195
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,298
You can count on me.

196
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,552
Any thing happens, is also always Idate, the faster runner of the Wasabi clan!

197
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,722
You must be trusted me!

198
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,224
Che sbruffone!

199
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,039
It would not have to want a lot to us why the port of Nagi is caught a glimpse.

200
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,958
I hope to have a good margin on Fukusuke.

201
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,136
Ehi, Naruto. Which thing of tasks?

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,930
Eh? Of that what?

203
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,848
Of Idate-Saint.

204
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,601
He is not a normal boy.

205
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,733
Its speed is tutt' other that normal.

206
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,111
It must have received a special training.

207
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,531
Type?

208
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,951
As an example, it could come from some hidden village.

209
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,914
How it is possible that a stupid person cos  ì is a Ninja?

210
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,332
Just you.>.!?

211
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,001
The not six person more adapted in order to say it!

212
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,671
But, but…

213
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,882
They are survivor to the Chuunin examination, not?

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,509
You?

215
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,135
The Chuunin examination?

216
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,222
Ehi, ehi! Not to interrupt to us.

217
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,350
I have conquered the title it to the torneo. They have become Chuunin

218
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,398
Probably your examiner must itself be distracted.

219
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,111
Eternal damnation, as it can fall cos ì  the Chuunin examination low …

220
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,906
Idate-saint, then you are…

224
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:50,998
I have understood.>.

225
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,542
If me memory well, the examiner of before the test…

226
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,129
Fairies Hush! Cos' is this confusion?

227
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,133
I have made you to wait for?

228
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,387
They are the examiner of before the test of the Chuunin examination.

229
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,639
Morino Ibiki.

230
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,184
Morino Ibiki.

231
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,643
Which thing you have said?

232
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,605
My brother greater Ibiki is still alive ?

233
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:15,689
S ì.

234
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:21,695
Sure! That man has made us to support a just difficult test.

235
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,864
Truly? It is  truly alive?

236
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,409
Qu.... Cos' has been?

237
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,286
It is  an ambush!

238
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,295
Then?

239
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,922
You see?

240
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,089
It is  just here

241
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,425
The operation  can  begin.

242
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,819
I and Naruto remain here in order to stop those persons.>.

243
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,239
Sakura, account on you. You take cure of Idate.

244
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,657
It would not be better to escape?

245
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,866
E' too much late in order to escape!

246
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,249
I try to hold occupied them.

247
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,542
You ransom the ropes.

248
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:17,835
I have understood!

249
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,462
Merda, I must cut them at all costs.

250
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,012
Eternal damnation! I have lost them all before!

251
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,098
Ehi! It lend yours to me.

252
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,182

00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,184
Gone, sbrigate to you!

Six crazy one?

255
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,023
For me this is worth more of my same life.

256
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,485
I do not have time for these cavolate!

257
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,070

You move, cretino!

259
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,831
Easier than how much you thought.

260
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,002
Sakura-chan!

261
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,837
They are only of the cloni!

262
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,716
Those true ones can only attack from their boat, not preoccuparti.

263
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,510
SHARINGAN

264
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,057

265
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,393
Those true ones hide in the cloni.

266
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:17,644
You are prudent!

267
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,813

Creeds that the aid of a Ninja wants?

Also in a situation of the sort.... but as you allow yourself?

271

Beautiful job, Naruto!

278
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,554

279
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:57,643

290
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:38,934
Not ago nothing.

291
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:42,896
One heated arrow?

292
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,584

293
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,171
Vai! If you remain here, you will be only of impiccio.

294
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,007
Brother!

295
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,051
Idate-saint?

296
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:15,637

297
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,598
Sasuke, than what we make now?

298
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,433
The flames are too much high!

299
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,854
We must be thrown in water.

300
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,773
We will swim until the coast of Nagi.

301
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,901
You have reason. We do not have other choice.

302

Idate-saint, sapete to swim?

303
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,620

In order now it is only of the smoke, we can escape without being wounded.
