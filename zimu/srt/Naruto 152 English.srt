1
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:16,959
<i>Hey boys, listen up!</i>

2
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:21,555
<i>Humans aren't such a big deal</i>

3
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:26,396
<i>Who needs tomorrow anyway,</i>

4
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,667
<i>so don't hide your fists</i>

5
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,873
<i>You're not old enough</i>

6
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:40,247
<i>to sell your dreams away to uncertainty</i>

7
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:45,622
<i>Hey boys, you're the only ones</i>

8
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>who can pull the trigger in your heart</i>

9
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,595
<i>All the kids said</i>

10
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:55,598
<i>We're living in this senseless, ridiculous,</i>

11
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,966
<i>awesome world right at this moment,</i>

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,434
<i>All the kids said</i>

13
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:08,308
<i>Don't forget every truth or lie</i>

14
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:11,977
<i>All the kids said</i>

15
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,381
<i>We're way too young to die</i>

16
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:19,252
<i>In this empty town lined with empty faces</i>

17
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:21,518
<i>All the kids took off</i>

18
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>into this windless night</i>

19
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:27,495
<i>Because they want to change something</i>

20
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:53,446
<i>Funeral March for the Living</i>

21
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,126
Wh Why...

22
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:03,330
Why does such
a good man have to... die?!

23
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:07,495
It's sad...
It's so sad!

24
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,744
I remember now...

25
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:24,445
I forgot when,
but you showed it to me, didn't you?

26
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,988
With a twinkle in your eye,

27
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,550
you proudly said it was
a memento of your father.

28
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:36,092
That was the pipe box, wasn't it?
It was an amazing box.

29
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,565
No wonder you're so proud of it...

30
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:43,840
Even though I took it and smashed it,
you only laughed.

31
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:50,007
You were smiling when
we kicked you and tossed you.

32
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:52,172
It was a great smile.

33
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:54,450
Really...

34
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,147
Hold it in, Rokusuke!
They'll all be gone.

35
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:00,986
If we let this moment go,

36
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,253
there will be no other chance
to get out of the village.

37
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,727
But Kanpachi is!

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,392
It's for the village,

39
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:11,594
we have to do something and
make our way to that village!

40
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,607
Yeah...

41
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,707
Funerals are awesome, aren't they!

42
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:30,743
I wanna do that again.

43
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:41,956
One... two... three people...
got away again...

44
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:46,231
Looks like we can have
another funeral.

45
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,258
This is...

46
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,588
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.

47
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:12,796
You are...?

48
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:17,998
Naruto Uzumaki! Right now,
I'm in the middle of training.

49
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:19,995
The Village Hidden in the Leaves...

50
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,699
H-Hey! I said hey!

51
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,068
Hang in there!

52
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,441
This is training too...!

53
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,800
I can't give up yet! Not yet!

54
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,181
The escort for the ruler of
the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,

55
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,916
was completed without incident!

56
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,181
Well done.

57
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,183
That's Lady Tsunade's...!

58
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:23,332
Excellent dumplings are always
from the Leaf Village, aren't they?

59
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:26,566
That was my last one!

60
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,739
Mission Accomplished!

61
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,304
I came to pound the pirates
of the Gottani Channel

62
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,509
with the fist of love!

63
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:44,518
If they take this opportunity
to rehabilitate themselves,

64
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:48,046
it's worth while to shed a tear!

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,629
I'll have your team do it for me.

66
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:00,827
Yes?

67
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,238
Even though we're already busy,
that Naruto brought in more work.

68
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:11,036
After this, Guy has the S rank mission.

69
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:15,809
The client picked him,
so he must depart today.

70
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:17,644
So, do it without Guy.

71
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,615
That's pretty straightforward...

72
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:23,952
I called Neji Hyuga,
Tenten and Lee.

73
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,594
Ohh!

74
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:29,758
My pupils can undertake the fulfillment
of this mission without incident!

75
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:30,826
Wait...

76
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,494
Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.

77
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:40,242
Why can't it just be <i>my</i> pupils,
who are loved by all the world?

78
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,175
Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,172
It just is.

80
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,912
Hidden Leaf Hospital

81
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,049
Those three people that Naruto saved
came all the way

82
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,753
from the Katabami Gold Mine
to request a mission.

83
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:02,592
Katabami Gold Mine is one of
the Land of Rivers' greatest mines,

84
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,295
but about half a year ago, hooligans
calling themselves the Kurosuki family

85
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,238
appeared on the pretext of guarding it,
and took control of the village...

86
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:14,403
killing villagers for
no particular reason.

87
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,209
How vile!

88
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,547
Your mission is this:

89
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:21,243
Once those three have
regained their strength,

90
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:25,084
escort them to Katabami Gold Mine
and eliminate the Kurosuki family.

91
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,488
It's a simple mission.

92
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,191
Well anyway, it must be a group
of punks who're after money.

93
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,888
Why did you call me for
such an easy mission?

94
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:40,000
Who do you think you are?

95
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,803
I'm busy searching for
Sasuke and training, and!

96
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,372
You forced your way into missions
that you weren't called for.

97
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,912
It's not a Genin's place
to choose his missions!

98
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,814
Would you like to be sent back
to the Academy? Well?!

99
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:55,579
Neji Hyuga!

100
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:56,380
Yes!

101
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,647
You're the leader!

102
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,887
It will be good training for you
to try to tame the unstable.

103
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,053
I don't want to...
but, I'll do it!

104
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,390
I'll go continue my training!

105
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,167
Hey Naruto!

106
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:18,731
Please excuse them.
They have no manners...

107
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:22,975
Wait!

108
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,551
Those little brats...!

109
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,919
What the heck do
they think missions are?!

110
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:35,816
Umm, excuse me?

111
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,124
What?!

112
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,559
The Kurosuki Family...

113
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,926
What did you say
their boss' name was?

114
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:42,156
Raiga!

115
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,631
That's what I thought...

116
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:44,999
What?

117
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:48,936
Well, on a previous mission,
I heard a rumor about him.

118
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:51,806
A rumor...?

119
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:56,208
Pervy Sage hasn't returned...
I'm forced to go on a mission...

120
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,410
Oh, this is irritating...

121
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,644
Sakura!

122
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:02,952
Naruto?

123
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,818
What's going on? A bird?

124
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:10,385
Yesterday I found it injured
and treated it, but...

125
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,806
Sakura, that's amazing!

126
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,473
But poor thing.

127
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,175
It's separated from its friends.

128
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,081
Naruto!

129
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,320
Oh, sorry, did I intrude?

130
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,986
You intruded big time!

131
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,758
No, no!

132
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:52,359
Don't turn your back,
no need to grovel to youth.

133
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,732
Sakura, Hello!

134
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:57,268
Hello!

135
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,807
What did you come here for?

136
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,737
- Just to have a word.
- Huh? What the?!

137
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,604
Oh, Sakura, goodbye!

138
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,943
- Hey! What was that?!
- She went wild, didn't she?

139
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:07,381
She should act her age.

140
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,913
Ichiraku
What?! The boss of
the Kurosuki family

141
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:16,618
is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?

142
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,627
Yeah, it's exclusive information
from our respected teacher, Guy.

143
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,000
Who're the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?

144
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,531
Naruto, you said that

145
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:30,198
you fought in the Land of
the Waves mission, didn't you?

146
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,236
At that time...

147
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,742
Oh, Zabuza! And?

148
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:41,045
And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei
fought Kisame Hoshigaki.

149
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:44,351
I heard that
you met them there too, Naruto.

150
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:49,122
Oh! I know that guy!

151
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:50,819
Those two were once called

152
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:55,160
the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist.

153
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,324
And at that time,
who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?

154
00:10:58,401 --> 00:10:59,368
Oh!

155
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,906
The man called Itachi!
And then?

156
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:06,135
You still don't understand?

157
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,941
If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,

158
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:14,541
then he's probably tied to Itachi
who was with Kisame.

159
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:16,843
Oh! And?

160
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,145
Tell me, who's after Itachi?

161
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,458
I know! Sasuke!

162
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,283
That's right!

163
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,388
We can probably get
the clue to Sasuke's whereabouts

164
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:29,489
at Katabami Gold Mine!

165
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:30,791
But...

166
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,262
If that's what Guy Sensei said then...

167
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,668
Don't say anything rude!

168
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,271
It's information that's
100% reliable!

169
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:47,305
Starting now,
while guarding Rokusuke and the others,

170
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,147
we head toward Katabami Gold Mine

171
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,380
to fulfill our mission to
wipe out the Kurosuki family.

172
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,485
There's a shop I'm familiar
with close to the gold mine.

173
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,256
Let's make that the base.

174
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,018
What do you mean
a shop you're familiar with?

175
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:01,555
That's the fun part of the trip.

176
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,695
That aside, that Naruto is late...

177
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:08,333
If the source of the information
is Guy Sensei,

178
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:10,396
maybe he couldn't quite trust it?

179
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:13,733
That's not true!
Naruto will definitely come!

180
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,002
That's because Guy Sensei's
information is correct!

181
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,307
Whatever.

182
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,511
Here I am!

183
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,281
We're all here so...!

184
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,057
Is that for you to say?!

185
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,252
Let's go!

186
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,892
So... which way?

187
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,091
Don't be so anxious, Rokusuke,

188
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,328
Those guys will save our town.

189
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,293
It's post meal training!

190
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,368
I won't lose!

191
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,080
I won't lose!

192
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:32,114
How long do you intend
to rest here?!

193
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:36,353
If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi
from the burial...

194
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,022
Give it up...

195
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:41,086
How long do you think
it's been since that happened?

196
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,826
It's painful but...

197
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,300
I remember... this sleepiness.
The shop is close by.

198
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:58,347
You say you're sleepy,
and are you walking in your sleep?!

199
00:13:58,515 --> 00:13:59,607
It's okay.

200
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:04,776
I slept while on a marathon on
this road for three days straight.

201
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,352
You are joking, right?

202
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,751
It's true.

203
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,552
The track meet of my youth
with Guy Sensei.

204
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,224
My body still remembers it.

205
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,390
I've gotten sleepy.

206
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,393
Hey, Bushy Brow,
are you really okay?

207
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:23,766
That's right. In this area,
there's the scent of spicy curry.

208
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,701
Curry? Now that you mention it...

209
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,200
That's right!

210
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,180
Over there, it's...
the Curry of Life Shop!

211
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:39,145
Grandma Sansho!

212
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,587
Oh my...
Oh goodness!

213
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:42,886
I haven't seen you for a while!

214
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,553
- Oh my my my!
- You're looking well!

215
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,687
This is the shop Lee is familiar with?

216
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,964
That mountain is
the Katabami Gold Mine

217
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:04,847
Grandma Sansho's curry saved my life.

218
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:07,676
So you're saying
it's delicious curry?

219
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,983
No, it really saved my life.
I'm indebted to this curry.

220
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:15,283
It was when
I'd just become a Genin...

221
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:19,427
When Guy Sensei gave me
a special training routine.

222
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:24,889
Oh my, that's right.
I remember.

223
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:28,667
Do your best!

224
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,171
Oh my...

225
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,639
Hey Grandma Sansho!

226
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,645
Oh my, they've come again!

227
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:49,956
Those people are running in their sleep.

228
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,198
Karashi! Karashi!

229
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,297
If you had that kind of energy,
you wouldn't lose to the bullies.

230
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:09,912
Oh my,
I might have said too much.

231
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,112
Curry of Life Shop

232
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:33,932
Oh my! It's the third day.

233
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:36,096
They've been running the whole time.

234
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:41,401
Oh my. What a problem.

235
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,489
I wonder if he's hungry...?

236
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,732
What a pickle! He's not waking up!

237
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,207
Maybe I didn't use
enough spice?

238
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,349
Karashi...

239
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:35,322
I've never seen a person
who works this hard.

240
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:40,635
Oh really... so you want to help
this young man too?

241
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:02,382
This is the curry of life.

242
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:08,692
Now! Grandma Sansho went to
the trouble of making this curry.

243
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:10,225
Let's eat!

244
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,565
I'm digging in!

245
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:43,426
Yum!
This is yummy yum delicious!

246
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,867
Delicious! The use of spices
is wonderful!

247
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:50,497
And this rice
goes perfectly with the curry!

248
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:06,155
Delicious!

249
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,548
By the way, I don't see Karashi.

250
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,987
Karashi saw how hard you worked

251
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:16,998
and became a bright kid
full of energy, but...

252
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,996
He got too much energy
and left for town.

253
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,764
What?

254
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:26,839
I was wrong to keep telling him
to be stronger.

255
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:28,608
"I'm going to be a man!

256
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,771
I'm going to be part of
the Kurosuki family, he said.

257
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,748
Oh my! I'm not blaming you.
Don't worry.

258
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:40,982
It's too late.

259
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:43,049
I'm responsible...

260
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,653
Oh my.

261
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,286
Neji!

262
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:49,331
Please include Karashi's rescue
into our mission!

263
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,466
We'll bring him back from
the road of evil!

264
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,237
It's fine.

265
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:06,611
We'll use this shop as a base
and take a good look into the village.

266
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,812
Then we'll come up with a strategy
and spring into action.

267
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:10,750
Yes!

268
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,486
You guys await orders here.

269
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,683
Because it's dangerous
if the Kurosuki family finds us.

270
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:23,632
It's a disaster!

271
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:29,062
Rokusuke! Rokusuke!
He's gone!

272
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:34,867
I'm sure he went to town alone!

273
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,002
That's not good!

274
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:38,507
If those guys find Rokusuke...!

275
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,349
Now that it's come to this,

276
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:44,352
we don't have time
to come up with a strategy!

277
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:46,554
Let's get right to it!

278
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:48,253
No!

279
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,523
We'll get right to it!

280
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,327
Let's hurry.

281
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,835
<i>Wait for me, Kanpachi,</i>
<i>I'm coming now...</i>

282
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:08,202
Someone... is coming...

283
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:14,281
Aw, again...
I have to put on a funeral!

284
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:32,463
<i>Crappy news pass us by</i>

285
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:35,936
<i>And you become speechless</i>

286
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,936
<i>My voice is way too soft</i>

287
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:45,174
<i>So you don't answer</i>

288
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:50,877
<i>You're crying Crying alone</i>

289
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:55,754
<i>What can I do? I'm crying too</i>

290
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:58,259
<i>"Let my lonely scream ring out</i>
<i>through the night"</i>

291
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:07,463
<i>I'll thrash this confused era</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

292
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:17,071
<i>And I'll thrash this confused night</i>
<i>with my speed Yeah</i>

293
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:26,248
<i>I'll thrash them with my piercing guitar</i>
<i>and my speed Yeah</i>

294
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:38,060
<i>This sinking world and its evil bastards,</i>
<i>I'll kick their butt Yeah</i>

295
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:53,380
You taught me that day.

296
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:55,478
If you cook with great care,

297
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:59,009
you can save someone's life
with just one serving of curry.

298
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:00,812
Even for a person like me,

299
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,518
with intense effort,
it's not an impossibility...

300
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,054
That's what I thought.

301
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:09,554
You were far more admirable
back then, Karashi.

302
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,766
But...

303
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:15,367
Next time: "A Lesson Learned!
The Iron Fist of Love!"
