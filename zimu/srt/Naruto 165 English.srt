1
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:21,522
<i>I want to try and gather</i>
<i>the unrestrained winds</i>

2
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:26,331
<i>I'll run toward the horizon,</i>
<i>alongside the wave crests</i>

3
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:28,963
<i>I've made my decision,</i>

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,564
<i>even if there's a long way to go</i>
<i>on that road.</i>

5
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:36,169
<i>I'll continue towards the future I've planned</i>

6
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:46,087
<i>Time rushes us</i>
<i>The heartbeat speeds up</i>

7
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:55,458
<i>When I woke in the middle of a dream</i>
<i>I kept searching for that same light</i>

8
00:00:56,433 --> 00:01:06,240
<i>Under the shining star lit sky with</i>
<i>countless constellations and shadows</i>

9
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:15,717
<i>There was something beyond that...</i>
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

10
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:20,847
<i>What were you gazing at?</i>

11
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,481
Kakashi Sensei...

12
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:59,028
The mission in the Land of Birds
is over...

13
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:01,659
That is enough.

14
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,097
But, then what about Naruto?

15
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,136
As the leader,
I am responsible for all of this.

16
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:12,102
Sacrifice is an unavoidable part
of Shinobi missions...

17
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,168
Now...

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,538
Let's go back to our village!

19
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,256
Do you think they're really going back
to their village, Nagare?

20
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,164
Perhaps...

21
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,302
But I'm concerned about that masked guy
who joined up with them later...

22
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,803
Shall I follow him, Hokushin?

23
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,644
No, I'll do that.
You give the report.

24
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:51,673
All right...

25
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:59,018
<i>The Death of Naruto</i>

26
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:16,765
How did things turn out?

27
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:21,203
The two as well as the one
who joined up with them later...

28
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,007
seem to have crossed the border

29
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,512
and are heading for the Village Hidden in Leaves.

30
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:27,642
I see.

31
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:30,916
And it seems Lord Sagi
took care

32
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:34,514
of the one who infiltrated the residence
of the feudal lord.

33
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,463
Very nice indeed.

34
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,634
What're they doing there
for the past hour...?

35
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:56,744
P-Persimmon!
Wh-What the...?

36
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,883
- Ouch...
- That hurts...

37
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,049
It couldn't be!

38
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,857
Substitution Jutsu!
Since when...?

39
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:20,895
They tricked me!
Those Leaf Shinobi...

40
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:46,424
Lord Komei... Come out.

41
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,875
Land of Birds Tactician Komei.

42
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,608
You have abused the key position
in this land of tactician

43
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:44,085
and committed the crime
of assassinating

44
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:47,590
the previous feudal lord Lord Owashi
and his child Lady Toki.

45
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:50,283
And you also ordered a subordinate

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,090
to run wild as the ghost
called the Cursed Warrior,

47
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:57,065
disturbed the public, you undermined
the government of the land,

48
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,595
endangered Lord Sagi's position
of feudal lord

49
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,162
and attempted to attain
the position himself,

50
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,299
an unforgivable crime of treason!

51
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,911
Therefore, you are ordered
to perform seppuku!

52
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:26,461
I see... That explains it.

53
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:30,259
You ensnared me,
didn't you, Moso?!

54
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:37,662
You're disgraceful, Komei!
If you're a warrior, kill yourself like one!

55
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,102
Assist him with the seppuku
at once!

56
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,105
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

57
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,263
<i>Is this it now...?</i>

58
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,867
Wh What?!

59
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,244
Hidden Mist Jutsu?
No! This is...

60
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,184
It does not matter! Kill him!

61
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,215
Yes, my lord!

62
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,148
Begging your pardon,
I shall assist!

63
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:32,386
Who are you?!

64
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,261
Wh What is this?
What's going on?!

65
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,435
- The Cursed Warrior!
- It's the Cursed Warrior...

66
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,135
That's the Cursed Warrior?!

67
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,101
Yes!

68
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,842
After him! Don't let him get away!

69
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:50,742
- Right!
- Right!

70
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,786
You guys go after him as is...!

71
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,355
I've got something
I want to look into,

72
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:07,718
so I'll be going on ahead!

73
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:08,795
- Roger!
- Roger!

74
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,240
I knew it!

75
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:25,711
You two were conspirators, right?!

76
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,379
Hold it!

77
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,015
You're the guys from
the other night...

78
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,885
<i>I've witnessed the true identity</i>
<i>of the ghost.</i>

79
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:38,924
<i>Who's there?</i>

80
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:41,658
<i>Hey hey, Komei.</i>

81
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:45,825
<i>You're the one responsible for</i>
<i>controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?</i>

82
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,632
I was also attempting
to investigate

83
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,234
the true identity of
the Cursed Warrior that day...

84
00:08:56,513 --> 00:09:01,143
I was almost sure it couldn't
be anyone but that person...

85
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:04,548
What a pain! I'll expose
the true identity here.

86
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:08,724
Don't bother...

87
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,688
Kakashi Sensei.
Where were you until now?

88
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,357
I'll explain later.
Go on ahead!

89
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,494
Hurry! You're going with them.

90
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:23,533
But...

91
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,866
Let's go, T enten!

92
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,839
Wait, Neji!

93
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,270
Come on out...

94
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:31,437
You were following me
the whole time, right?

95
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,161
If that's your intention...

96
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,631
Summoning Jutsu!

97
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,599
What is it, Kakashi?

98
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,673
Smoke out the Ninja hiding
on the temple grounds...

99
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,339
Consider it done.

100
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,949
Hey! You there...

101
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,146
Hide and seek is over.
Come on out now!

102
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,622
I can't fool a dog's nose,
as would be expected...

103
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,387
You finally grace me with
your presence, huh?

104
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:40,847
Why is there a hole...
in a place like this?

105
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,344
I have heard the feudal lord built
secret passages such as this

106
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,414
all over the land in order to look in
on the lives of the general public...

107
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:50,893
The feudal lord?!

108
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,419
Then that Cursed Warrior
has something to do

109
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,793
with the feudal lord?

110
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:58,324
At the very least,
it seems he's not a ghost.

111
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:00,666
When the time comes,

112
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,706
I'm sure he will reveal
his true identity from his end.

113
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,285
Isn't it common sense for
hired Ninja

114
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:21,119
to return quietly to their village
after completing a mission?

115
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:22,819
It's different in the case

116
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,326
of the premise of the commissioned
mission breaking down.

117
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,362
There were too many
suspicious points in this mission.

118
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:33,026
You're sticking your nose too far
into the business of another land.

119
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,302
Here you could've returned safely
to your land

120
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,499
if you hadn't secretively
sniffed around like a dog.

121
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,868
Excuse me for being a dog!

122
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,148
Universal Assimilation Jutsu!

123
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,580
Prepare yourself!

124
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:54,751
What?!

125
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:56,582
What <i>is</i> this guy?!

126
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,892
Has he introduced properties
of stone into his body?

127
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,962
Since you've learned of part
of this land's secrets,

128
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,226
I can't let you live!

129
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,594
He seems to be a somewhat
troublesome opponent.

130
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,337
Yeah. That's good enough, Pakkun.

131
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,264
I'll be okay by myself from here on.

132
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:13,165
I see... See you later!

133
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:16,836
Assimilation: Rock Tank.

134
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:19,975
I'll crush you!

135
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,111
A Shadow Clone...?!

136
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,885
This is as far as it goes...

137
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:30,984
It can't be...

138
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,122
A Paper Bomb?!

139
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,854
Now... That should be enough, right?

140
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:03,953
Huh?

141
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:07,321
Yeah... We should be okay
having come this far.

142
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:09,394
Th That voice...?!

143
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,002
N -Naruto...!

144
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:22,978
I knew it.

145
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:27,605
The true identity of the Cursed Warrior
wasn't Lord Sagi?

146
00:13:58,447 --> 00:13:59,471
Your...

147
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,849
Your true identity is...

148
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:09,054
Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?

149
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,991
From the way he was standing still,

150
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,761
I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.

151
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,268
There's a profound reason for this...

152
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,268
What're you doing, Tenten?!

153
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:27,942
Then tell me sooner!

154
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,777
It seems you also knew
it was Naruto, Neji.

155
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,806
Yeah... Ages ago.

156
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,707
Jeez, you two!

157
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,984
I was really worried!

158
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:40,787
There was a surveillance Shinobi
following us the whole time, right?

159
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,590
<i>Neji, Tenten...</i>
<i>Don't look back.</i>

160
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,190
<i>We're being followed!</i>

161
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,204
<i>We're going back to</i>
<i>the Land of Birds.</i>

162
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:03,539
<i>Just do as I say... Got it?!</i>

163
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:04,940
<i>Y Yes!</i>

164
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,277
<i>Understood...</i>

165
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:11,214
But didn't we shake the pursuer
with Substitution?

166
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:13,579
Yes... Once...

167
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:19,789
However...

168
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,194
when we chased the Cursed Warrior
from the execution grounds...

169
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,389
a different Shinobi followed us.

170
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:30,596
Jeez... Am I the only one
who didn't know?

171
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,139
It was a waste to worry!

172
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:35,267
Then you,
in the place of Lord Sagi...?

173
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:36,508
Yeah...

174
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,943
I see... So Lord Sagi is safe!

175
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,144
You okay, mister?!

176
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,348
I'm sorry...

177
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,745
That Moso acted rashly,

178
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,188
forcing me to make
a false confession.

179
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,224
Man, you've been beaten up good...

180
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,660
Well, we'll tell you about
the developments inside.

181
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:57,994
Sagi is waiting!

182
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,768
Assimilation: Rock Shower!

183
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:16,448
We're Wandering Shinobi...

184
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:20,353
We make do without having a village
by going around to every village,

185
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:24,519
stealing Jutsu and
devising new Ninjutsu.

186
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:28,363
For example,
a Jutsu like this one, too...

187
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,294
S Say what?

188
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,197
Sharingan!

189
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,002
Assimilation: Sand Coffin!

190
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:43,741
<i>He's using the same Jutsu</i>
<i>as Gaara!</i>

191
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,615
Assimilation: Sand Funeral!

192
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:56,817
Sagi!

193
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:59,888
How's Chishima doing...?

194
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,957
He's okay...
There's no threat to his life.

195
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,662
He's resting and receiving treatment

196
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,035
in the treatment room
of my residence.

197
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,272
That's good...

198
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,413
Did something happen to Chishima?

199
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,413
Who...? Who hurt him?!

200
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:24,612
K omei... I'm sorry for
the misunderstanding!

201
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,821
My lord, I don't deserve
those magnanimous words!

202
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,818
Although he had suffered injuries,
Chishima came to tell me.

203
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,223
At that time...

204
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:42,330
I must not let you live as is

205
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,464
now that you have learned
of everything!

206
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,334
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord,

207
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,640
your fate is the death sentence!

208
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:52,337
No way...!

209
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:54,545
L-Lord Sagi...

210
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:56,677
Chishima?!

211
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:57,480
Bro!

212
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:03,549
Shuriken wounds...?

213
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,019
Go to the residence doctor!

214
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,087
Lord Sagi...

215
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:08,589
Please listen...

216
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:13,258
Lord Moso, no,
Moso has betrayed you...

217
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:14,500
What?

218
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:16,827
Moso was the one

219
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:20,774
who killed your father, Lord Owashi,
and Lady Toki!

220
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:28,076
And Moso had his own Ninja henchmen
use the guardsmen shuriken

221
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,584
to falsely accuse Lord K omei...

222
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:35,055
I'm sure Lord Komei learned
of Moso's scheme and...

223
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,819
Hang in there, Chishima!

224
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:44,499
Lord Sagi, please...
Stop Lord Komei's execution.

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,831
We have to go save him quickly!

226
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,501
I must not stop the execution!

227
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:51,301
Wh Why is that?!

228
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:53,399
I won't be able to have my revenge

229
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:56,912
if Moso realizes that
I have learned the truth...

230
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,243
Are you saying it doesn't matter
who is sacrificed

231
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,976
if it's for the sake of your revenge?!

232
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,611
Then what would you do?

233
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:05,449
Komei is being kept under strict watch
by powerful soldiers.

234
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,647
We would have no chance
of winning

235
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:09,156
if theywe were to cause
a rebellion there...

236
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:13,160
Then I'll go!
I will save Komei on my own!

237
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,154
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

238
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,026
Lord Sagi...

239
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:22,304
Do as you like...

240
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:27,800
And so I disguised myself
as the Cursed Warrior.

241
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,575
I played the part of Cursed Warrior

242
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,547
and attempted to look for
the assassination culprit...

243
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,036
But against my intentions...

244
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,802
Instead of finding
the true culprit...

245
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:04,642
K omei... I was used as a tool
to incriminate you.

246
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,280
I thought the Cursed Warrior
I encountered in my bedroom

247
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:10,784
was you, Lord Sagi...

248
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,082
And so I headed for
the abandoned temple

249
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,182
where the Cursed Warrior
once vanished.

250
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:23,063
There I encountered
the Cursed Warrior, but...

251
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,364
That Cursed Warrior wasn't me.

252
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:29,698
Perhaps it was a fake
that Moso devised.

253
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,941
That's it, believe it!
All of it was that old man Moso's trap!

254
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,400
That Moso!

255
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,776
Did he think to first dispose
of me

256
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:41,407
and then eventually attempt to rule
the Land of Birds

257
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,644
by doing away with Lord Sagi?

258
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,053
That guy acting like a good guy!

259
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,816
I'll grab him up and kick his butt!

260
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,050
Naruto, was it?
You did good work.

261
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:51,688
However...

262
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,953
I will take care of things
from here on!

263
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,729
Well... But...

264
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,103
I will even the score by myself.

265
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,767
As long as the score isn't settled...

266
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:14,040
the clock inside my heart...
will remain stopped in the past!

267
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:42,003
<i>So many things happen</i>
<i>on this endless road, huh?</i>

268
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:53,581
<i>Although you're strong willed,</i>
<i>your voice wavered on the phone today</i>

269
00:21:54,323 --> 00:22:04,892
<i>What dreams did you chase to get here?</i>

270
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:17,077
<i>Even I have times when</i>
<i>I just don't understand, baby</i>

271
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:28,521
<i>When you're sad, I'll be close to you</i>

272
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:40,066
<i>Even on nights when we're apart,</i>
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

273
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:45,831
<i>I'll be close to you</i>

274
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,612
What do you mean you will
even the score on your own?!

275
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:56,473
What good can you do
going by yourself?!

276
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,285
Even you did avengerthem,
the dead won't come back!

277
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:04,858
Do you still insist on having revenget?!

278
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,251
Would that make you
feel better?!

279
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:12,465
Would that really make
your father and sister happy?!

280
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,397
Next time: "When Time Stands Still"
