00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Six lucky person.

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,290
He is served to you to something to play to the dolls?

35
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,560
He knew of karasu!

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,940
It makes null.

37
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,240

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,540
Hour I explain to you.

39
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,420
This last one....

40
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,800
 it is a deprived of hope rule.

41
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,860
Hour that ours subordinates to you not there am.

42
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,360

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,600
Not to worry to you.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,660
Soon we will be occupied.

45
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,940
Why?

46
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,860
This year the examiner of before
test will be Morino Ibiki

47
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,170
Cos   also first part of the examination will be difficult.

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,790
Why they have chosen just that sadist?

49
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,190
Sadist?

50
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,710
Kurenai

51
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,500
Six anchor one jonin novizia
and therefore you cannot know it.

52
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,130
Who would be this tizio?

53
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,980
E' a professional.

54
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,750
A professional?

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,030
Of what?

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,090
Of the torture and the interrogation.

57
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,750
What?

58
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,630
Even if in the examination not there are physical tortures....

59
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:53,120
 the boys will be subordinates to violence
psychological dates its abilities of inquisitore.

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,630
E' the commander

61
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,590
 of the group of torture and interrogation

62
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,900
 Morino Ibiki.

63
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,580
A deprived of hope rule!

64
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:19,670
Everyone of you will decide if to support
or less this last question.

65
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,290
To decide if to support it or not?

66
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,550
Like "deciding"!

67
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,630
That it succeeds if we refused
of giving the last question?

68
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,510
If you decide not to answer
your points will go to zero

69
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,870
 that is you will come bocciati

70
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,630
 obviously with to the others two of the group.

71
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,840
What means?

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,550
Obvious E' that we will choose to support it!

73
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,450
E' hauling that all the group fails!

74
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,430
Moreover

75
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,780
 there is an other rule.

76
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,150
Still!

77
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,530
Enough now!

78
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,690
If you will decide to support it
and the answer will be wrong

79
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,270
 it will be removed to you

80
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,910
 in order always I privilege to participate
to the examination of selection of the chunin.

81
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,060
That absurdity is never this!

82
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,290
Moreover there is who here has participated
piu times to this examination!

83
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,400
You have been ill-fated.

84
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,470
This year I make them rules them.

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,730
And for that I have given to you
the possibility to go some to you.

86
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,450
Those that do not have the courage,
enough that they decide not to support it

87
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,630
 and to give to the examination the next year
or the year after anchor.

88
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,870
Therefore

89
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,460
 if it is withdrawn

90
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,960
 also the rest group
it will be bocciato.

91
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,600
But if you decide to support it and
they do not give the exact answer

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,650
 you remain genin for all a life.

93
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,300
However it goes is put badly.

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,900
A normal person would not be able
to face one similar chosen.

95
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,910
Cominciamo.

96
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,210
Who does not want to support this question

97
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,770
 he raises the hand.

98
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,380
After that we will have controlled
your number you will exit from here.

99
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,830
Which type of question will be?

100
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,200
Eternal damnation!

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,460
If mistake rimarr   genin an all the life.

102
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,940
I do not want!

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,640
But if to choose   not to support it

104
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,550
 falliranno Sasuke and Sakura-chan
for guilt mine and does not have to happen.

105
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,590
I do not want to raise the hand

106
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,000
 why they are sure to make it us.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
But

108
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,320
But Naruto, for you is various.

109
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,510
You not.

110
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,480
You would have to ignore to us and to raise the hand
and to try again an other time.

111
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,870
I

112
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,100
 I

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,660
I withdraw myself!

114
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,020
I do not want to make this examination!

115
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,520
Number 50, you have failed.

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,500
Bocciati numbers 130 and 111.

117
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,480
Me dispiace....

118
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,570

123
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,880
Why it does not raise the hand?

124
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,000
He

I am a genius and a day
to receive   the title it of hokage.

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,510

the village my value.

132
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,100
It always continues to repeat.

133
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,990
 like an idiot

134
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,030
 that you will become hokage.

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,210
Me dispiace, Naruto.

136
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,750
I do not want

137
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,270
 to ruin this to you

138
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,540
 unattainable dream.

139
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,850
You

140
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,890
Hibiki knows to bottom the psiche human.

141
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,610
The terrible thing is that

142
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:50,180
 the maneuver attacks them psychologically and

143
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,000
 making weight on their weaknesses.

144
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,300
You underrate me!
I not scapper !

145
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,010
To answer   to the question!

146
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,590
He does not import to me if rester 
genin an all the life

147
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,310
 why in any case diventer   hokage!

148
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,980
I do not have fear!

149
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,940
That character.

150
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,470
He does not think neanche a po' next to we.

151
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,680
Neanche a moment.

152
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,200
S 

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,670
 hour I recognize its stupidity.

154
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,460
You I repeat the last time.

155
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,620
This will be the choice
that it will decide of your life.

156
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,130
If you decide to withdraw itself it makes it now.

157
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,340
I do not want to withdraw in behind my words.

158
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,300
It makes part of my "creed ninja".

159
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,350
That interesting boy.

160
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,420
In a moment he has eliminated
the uncertainty of all the present ones.

161
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,530
They are remained 78 students, eh?

162
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,620
They are much more than how much you waited for to me.

163
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,990
By now not there is more nobody that wants to be gone some.

164
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,130
That determination!

165
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,970
Then

166
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,050
 I communicate to all the present ones

167
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,240
 that before the test

168
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,220
 it is exceeded!

169
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,020
Aspects! That it means!

170
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,920
We have been promoted?

171
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,850
And the tenth question that fine it has made!

172
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,110
Not never it has been.

173
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,860
Your decision little ago pu 
to be considered the 10 question.

174
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,810
What?

175
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,510
hey!

176
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,520
Then the 9 problems
that we have resolved until hour!

177
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,960
They have been useless!

178
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,970
Nothing at all.

179
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,800
The first 9 questions are served to the scope.

180
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:30,520
 to verify your dowries it characterizes them
in collecting information.

181
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,320
To collect information?

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,730
Exact!

183
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,900
In the first place the juice of this test

184
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,950
 it was in the first rules

185
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,280
 that it previewed a system
of appraisal to squares.

186
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,620
This has put you an anxiety
I lean making to think you

187
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,220
 of being one ballast
for your group.

188
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,420
S ! S !
It was what I imagined.

189
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,920
Bugiardo!

190
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:09,530
But the questions of the test were
too much difficult for you genin.

191
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,560
For which the greater part of you

192
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,390
 it will have thought that in order to maintain the score

193
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,310
 it was necessary to copy.

194
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,960
Therefore this examination gave
for discounted copying.

195
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,420
E' for that we have
inserted between of you two chunin

196
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,880
 that the answers knew all.

197
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,630
Truly!

198
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,910
I have put us a po' in order to find it.

199
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,860
yeah.

200
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
It was cos   obvious.

201
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,950
Strange E', indeed,
that not if notices some!

202
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,250
Vero Hinata?

203
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,120
I bet that

204
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,480
 not if n' it were shrewed.

205
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,610
For 

206
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,310
 it is obvious that who copy
badly it comes bocciato.

207
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,090
Why

208
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,160
 to times the information are
more important of our life.

209
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,920
In the missions and the battlefields

210
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,130
 information to cost of living are collected.

211
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,090
Terrible!

212
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,630
There are signs of ustioni,
holes of lives and scars.

213
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,450
They are signs of torture.

214
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,410
However it is not said that the obtained information

215
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,070
 making oneself to discover from the adversary
or from thirds party they are corrected.

216
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,580
It remembers to you!

217
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,550
To have of the information mistaken

218
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,370
 pu   to have destructive consequences
for the country and the companions.

219
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,940
for this reason we have made you
to collect information copying

220
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,890
 and we have eliminated those that

221
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,760
 they are remained behind.

222
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,080
For 

223
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,600
 continuous not to understand the sense
of this last question.

224
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,910
This tenth one

225
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,560
 it was the main question of this examination.

226
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,140
What you want to say?

227
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,860
I explain to you.

228
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,700
The tenth one consists in "supporting"
or in "not supporting".

229
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,300
E' clearly that it is one chosen
difficult and suffered.

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,180
Who has decided not to support it
he failed with its team.

231
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,000
If instead you support the question and mistakes

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,670
 you always come private in order of the possibility
to rifare the examination of Chunin selection.

233
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,030
E' just one demanded infida.

234
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,450
Imagined this situation

235
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,210
We suppose that you are resolutions
to become chunin.

236
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,180
Your mission is to recover
a secret document.

237
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,250
The number and the abilities are not known
of ninja opposing neither the their equipments.

238
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,010
Moreover us they could even be traps.

239
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,170
And now what fairies?

240
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,400
Executed or refused the mission?

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,060
You could put in danger

242
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,060
 your life and that one
of your group.

243
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,550
Pu   to go itself ahead avoiding
the dangerous missions?

244
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,490
The answer is

245
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,430
 Not!

246
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,650
There are missions that involve many risks
but that you cannot leave to lose.

247
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,260
It must demonstrate courage to the companions

248
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,600
 and to have the abilities for
to exceed these dangers.

249
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,080
E' this requirement for being
a chunin, that is a group leader.

250
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,040
Who does not succeed to put to risk
the own life in the crucial moments

251
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,680
 or who loses occasions thinking to.

252
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,540
 uncertain future opportunities.

253
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,270
All those shock that they succeed to take
only this type of superficial decisions

254
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,910
 they do not deserve, to my warning, to become chunin!

255
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,000
You that you have chosen to support

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,540
 pu   to say that you have given
the answer corrected to the tenth question.

257
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,630
They are sure that you will succeed to go encounter
to the difficolta that they will be introduced to you.

258
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,700
You have exceeded the income.

259
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,330
Before the test of selection
of the chunin it is finished.

You!

267
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,660
