Uffa of new!

22
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,261
From when they are returns to you from the country of the Waves
these two are a po' strange.

23
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,565
I feel myself to uneasiness

24
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,905
You come Kakashi-sensei soon!

25
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,528

Sapete today is lost to me for road.

28
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,975
Hey, hey, Kakashi-sensei!

29
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,532
We of group seven lately

30
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,409
Not more stimulant is something.

31
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,565
Much more exciting one!?

32
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:03,188
One hotter mission

33
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,556
 where it can express my ardor.

34
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,953

00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,536

In all the missions ago always beautiful figure

37
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,589
 and all the space removes me.

38
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,873
But it will not succeed more

39
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,095

00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,251

Seccato to me! It plants urlare!

47
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:17,305
I cannot lose against Sasuke.

48
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,492
Ehy, you

49
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:28,973

00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,600
IH, mrs....

51
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,901

Eh?

53
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:35,936
What happens?

54
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,738
These are not erbacce

55
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,024
Eh?

56
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,680
This is the garden that I was cultivating!

57
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,053
Ahia!!!

58
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:08,438
That someone me aids!

59
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:26,049
Stupid

60
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,507
Hey, from this part.

61
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:39,630
- Field of Traps -
Not to enter.

62
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:43,791
We go, you hold it

63
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:48,829
Bha, stupid.

64
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,740
It has intentional he to take the dog more large.

65
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,745
Asp waits for, waits for

66
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:05,512
This is the field of the traps!

67
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,616
This happens why it exaggerates.

68
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,978
Six propio one ball to the foot.

69
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,370
Sasukeee!!!

70
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:44,992
If still churns you I give you
the grace blow!

71
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:50,340
Lately the spirit
of square he is dissolving himself.

72
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,336
They are of agreement!

73
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:55,077
And what it is compromising the job
of square six you Sasuke!

74
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:56,918
Circles always to put to you in extension!

75
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:00,039
That one six you, cretino.

76
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,542
If you do not want it are to me inferior

77
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,432
 enough that it becomes more strongly than me.

78
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:20,392
It seems that they go less of agreement than before.

79
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,778
Maledizione, than nervous.

80
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,718
Outside from the village there are
tantissimi ninja more forts than me

81
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,714
 and I am here to lose time
with missions ridicules!

82
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,976
Well!

83
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:51,024
In order today we have ended.

84
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,642
Now I must deliver the relationship
of this mission.

85
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,610
Then me I go some.

86
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,640
Eeeh!

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,196
Sasuke-kun, aspettaaa!

88
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,322
You feel why

89
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,969
 we do not go

90
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,081
 to deepen entirety

91
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:16,826
 the square job?

92
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,263
Six equal one to Naruto.

93
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,558
- Equal to Naruto -

94
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,767
If you have time to lose with me why
you do not go to exercise to you in some technique!

95
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:33,091
For sincere being, your abilities are
inferiors to those of Naruto.

96
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,648
- Inferior to Naruto -

97
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,435
It has reason.

98
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:46,111
In whichever mission

99
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,320
 they are that one that contributes little.

100
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,237
Sakura-chan!

101
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:55,652
It leaves to lose Sasuke and we train ourselves
we two entirety!

102
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,840
The master is disappeared.

103
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,761
He has intentional to leave us single?

104
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,635
Would want to pass for one cliff!?

105
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:46,417
One cliff squared with two holes cos ?

106
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,459
Truly impossible E'!

107
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,886
I had not mistaken to judge to you!

108
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,059
Merits indeed of being mine avail again.

109
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,284
Hey

110
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,416
We have used too much powder.

111
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,108
With the femminilit of one woman

112
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,960
 the girl of the group ninja senior, Moegi.

113
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,142
The factorial decomposition fascinates me.

114
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,055
Udooon.

115
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,743
The brilliant one ninja

116
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,241
 number one of the village

117
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,993
 Konohamaru!

118
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:29,895
We three form the army of Konohamaru!

119
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:33,679
Just as I imagined.
Konohamaru & company.

120
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:34,833
Eh?

121
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,258
Why you have

122
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,247
 those glance at them?

123
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:43,018
In homage to your old one look.

124
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,094
Oooh

125
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,485
What means Oooh?

126
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:50,478
Lately your reactions
they are a po' cold.

127
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,155
Then?

128
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:54,578
What you want?

129
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,062
You see that coldness.

130
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,870
Head

131
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,465
Now six free one?

134
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,002
Truly?

135
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:13,873
If game with they

137
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:22,054
That sense has that a true one
ninja you play to make the ninja?

138
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,254
What is?

139
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:34,170
And I would be inferior here to this?

140
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:38,632
When me gurda in those
way me renders nervous.

141
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,827
Head, who is this girl?

142
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:51,956
He is watching like

Six best about that I thought

144
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:57,962
Ah?

145
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,234

147
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,527

Me of it I occupy.

161
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:01,571
Naruto succeeds to go
of agreement with its companions?

162
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:06,463
Beh enough.

163
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:10,348
Lately they have been a lot engaged

164
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:14,825
 and they are not successful anchor to see it.

165
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,744
They are a po' preoccupied

166
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:24,582
Iruka-sensei, like sapete
Naruto is in square with Sasuke Uchiha

167
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:28,166
 and with he bisticcia a po'
because it sees it as it avails again

168
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:33,136
 but like result its
abilities are improving.

169
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:35,672
A lot that sooner or later will catch up to you.

170
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,049
Of they are content.

171
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:55,201
