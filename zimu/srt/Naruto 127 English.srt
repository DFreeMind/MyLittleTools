1
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:20,822
<i>Connecting old words</i>
<i>that have been used up</i>

2
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:29,564
<i>I just want to convey</i>
<i>my simple thoughts</i>

3
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:35,001
<i>That day's faint wind blows away</i>

4
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,131
<i>at the castle ruins of yesterday</i>

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:45,278
<i>I'll laugh with you</i>
<i>and live for the moment</i>

6
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:52,920
<i>Still that incident</i>
<i>will continue to trouble you, right?</i>

7
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:57,815
<i>That's why it must be good bye</i>

8
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:04,799
<i>Leaving nothing behind,</i>
<i>let us share what is left</i>

9
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:11,998
<i>In time, we'll realize</i>
<i>that it was everything</i>

10
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:18,741
<i>And sadness will touch our cheeks,</i>
<i>creating a river of tears</i>

11
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:28,715
<i>Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex</i>
<i>and melting away</i>

12
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:43,865
<i>That form...?!</i>

13
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:29,807
So that's the extent of
the rumored "Absolute Defense?"

14
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:35,921
How disappointing.

15
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:49,465
I see... You were wearing sand, eh?

16
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,864
Your opponent's not just him!

17
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:53,535
I'm here, too!

18
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:13,958
<i>Th That attack just now...</i>

19
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:17,260
<i>It would've been dangerous</i>
<i>had I not been protected by sand.</i>

20
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:22,096
<i>M My body is still...</i>

21
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:26,569
<i>I'll just be a hindrance like this.</i>

22
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:31,441
Annoying sand...

23
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:35,139
You're first, Gaara.

24
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,501
<i>He yanked out his spinal column?!</i>

25
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,004
<i>Vengeful Strike.</i>
<i>The Bracken Dance</i>

26
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,089
Dance of the Clematis Flower.

27
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,220
Vine!

28
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:28,801
Flower!

29
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,201
A bone of the strongest calcification...

30
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:43,245
It will pierce you,
sand defense and all...

31
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:46,115
<i>No time...huh?</i>

32
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,826
Ultimate Defense: Shukaku's Shield!

33
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,801
Kabuto...

34
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:10,837
How much longer will
Kimimaro hold out for?

35
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,177
I think he should still
be okay for a while...

36
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,551
I did all I could with the treatment...

37
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:24,054
But there's not nearly enough
information about his body.

38
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,093
I think it'd be quite different
if we had something

39
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,758
like the medical history
and treatment data of his clan.

40
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:36,131
What came out after looking into it

41
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:45,078
was the bloody history of how
the Kaguya Clan became just him...

42
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:57,049
Fools who provoked the great land of
the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle

43
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,116
with just their clan
and were annihilated.

44
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:06,833
The Kaguya Clan was
a foolish clan that liked battle.

45
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:11,936
The battlefield was the only place
where they could be at peace.

46
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,603
But it was long ago when
a simple minded group

47
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:19,306
that only enjoyed slaughter
was acceptable...

48
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,949
The times are different now.

49
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,278
Doing something like fighting
only with power

50
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:28,982
against a governed organization
like the Mist...

51
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:33,255
can only be called an act of fools
rushing towards death.

52
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,721
And then you saved only he
who was the youngest

53
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,964
and the most exceptional
among the Kaguya Clan...

54
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:51,706
That kid possessed the power that
would be feared even by the fighting clan.

55
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:55,908
So it seems he was kept
in prison the whole time.

56
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:59,683
It would've been a waste to let him... die.

57
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:04,614
Who wouldn't want
that rare Kekkei Genkai?

58
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,989
He possesses a strong
and firm bone structure

59
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:11,555
and a defensive power to
repel all kinds of physical attacks.

60
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:15,301
And if turned to offense...

61
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,831
the bones become
a most powerful weapon.

62
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,784
<i>It's because I've fought him once</i>
<i>that I understand this.</i>

63
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:36,119
<i>That sand shield is</i>
<i>an absolute defense, no less.</i>

64
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,951
<i>And that unusual form...</i>

65
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,257
<i>It'll be okay.</i>
<i>There's no way it'll be broken!</i>

66
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:21,836
It's hard...

67
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,664
I gathered minerals with
great hardness from the ground,

68
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,574
applied pressure with Chakra
and mixed them into the sand.

69
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,320
You... that unusual Jutsu...

70
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,652
It's the Kekkei Genkai, right?

71
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,227
The Kaguya Clan...

72
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:51,860
The ability which now
only I possess.

73
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,395
The last one of the clan, eh?

74
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:58,905
Then it'll die out here today.

75
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,738
Indeed, that might happen.

76
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:06,770
Due to sickness,
my body will not last so long...

77
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,784
But, the clan will not die out.

78
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:17,782
Besides I'm not alone.

79
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,801
This is the "Earth" Curse Mark...

80
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:32,437
With this...

81
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,966
I can become a part of you,
Lord Orochimaru.

82
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,407
Let's get everything, Kimimaro.

83
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:43,850
And let's see the truth of
this world together.

84
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:45,751
Yes.

85
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:49,082
You're my "Vessel of Dreams."

86
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,756
I'm counting on you.

87
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:57,831
They are presents from me.
I hope you like them.

88
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:15,347
Would you rather... die or obey?

89
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,181
Obey...

90
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,783
You will!

91
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:38,229
Is this the best a team
of four can do?

92
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,907
I'll ask just once more...

93
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:46,346
Which would you rather choose?

94
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,549
Very well...

95
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,415
As of now, we're the Sound Ninja Five.

96
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,927
Not alone, you said?

97
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,029
That's right...

98
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:12,032
As an existence shouldering
one part of Lord Orochimaru's ambition...

99
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:17,872
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru's soul...

100
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:20,039
for all eternity.

101
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,843
Orochimaru's brainwashing, huh...?

102
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,820
You're a pitiful guy.

103
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:42,533
<i>I used my big moves too much.</i>
<i>I don't have much Chakra.</i>

104
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,299
<i>This is the last of it.</i>

105
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,077
What an amount of Chakra...

106
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,227
You are something...

107
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:17,260
I'll sink and confine you
200 meters into the ground.

108
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,865
By the pressure of the sand
stuck to your body,

109
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,740
you'll soon be unable to move,
not even a finger...

110
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,586
You did it...!
This time for sure you did it.

111
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,295
Dance...

112
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,268
Bracken Dance!

113
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,624
It is annoying...

114
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,569
It feels like a long time

115
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,936
when waiting eagerly for
something you want.

116
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,305
Kabuto...

117
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,143
Stop talking like
you're humoring a child!

118
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,337
I'm sorry...

119
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:38,712
But you should know
this the most, Lord Orochimaru.

120
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,287
Nobody can beat Kimimaro,

121
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,847
no matter what hindrance
should appear.

122
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,154
Thanks for saving me...

123
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:55,032
Being able to do something like this;
very impressive.

124
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:58,237
All I did was ride the sand
I'm always controlling.

125
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,005
You just have to know how you use it.

126
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,007
Lord Orochimaru...

127
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,447
I'm sorry, Lord Orochimaru...

128
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:23,762
At last... The destruction of
the Leaf will begin...

129
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:27,898
Third Hokage...
I'll teach you a thing or two.

130
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:42,915
Sorry to keep you waiting.

131
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,221
What's the matter, Kimimaro?

132
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,087
No... It's nothing.

133
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,773
Even the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village

134
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,372
is no match against us.

135
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:19,442
Of course...

136
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,246
Kimimaro, it's thanks to you...

137
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,551
Kimimaro!

138
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:31,129
Kimimaro, so you can't go on, huh?

139
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,701
I'm sorry, Lord Orochimaru.

140
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,272
<i>If I can't be of use...</i>

141
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:54,113
<i>then there's no significance</i>
<i>to my living.</i>

142
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,220
How is your condition, Kimimaro?

143
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,628
The "Destruction of the Leaf"
resulted in an unfortunate near miss.

144
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,233
But the Sound Ninja Four
have gone to pick up a new vessel...

145
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,898
Lord Orochimaru's new
"Vessel of Dreams."

146
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:21,980
<i>Orochimaru's brainwashing, huh...?</i>

147
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:25,011
<i>You're a pitiful guy...</i>

148
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:28,882
You're wrong... Far from it!

149
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:33,754
<i>There's no significance to living...</i>

150
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:39,792
<i>But...you might be able to discover</i>
<i>something interesting</i>

151
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,801
<i>by continuing to live...</i>

152
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:46,604
<i>Like how you discovered that flower...</i>

153
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:51,735
<i>Like how I discovered you.</i>

154
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,875
<i>This is the "Earth" Curse Mark!</i>

155
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,316
<i>With this... I can become</i>
<i>a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.</i>

156
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:06,586
<i>Let's get everything, Kimimaro...</i>

157
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,590
<i>And let's see the truth of</i>
<i>this world together.</i>

158
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,941
<i>I'm going to discover</i>
<i>the truth of this world!</i>

159
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:25,442
With Lord Orochimaru!

160
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,518
He was a persistent guy,
but this is the end.

161
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:38,951
He won't ever come out again.

162
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:40,993
R-Right...

163
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,092
I can't go on...

164
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,293
We're getting off...

165
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,065
It's not brainwashing!

166
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:58,902
That person...
Lord Orochimaru understands me!

167
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,879
What do you guys know?!

168
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,138
He's dead...

169
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,282
Could it be? Has Kimimaro...?

170
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:41,279
The likes of Kimimaro makes
no difference now...

171
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:47,521
Sasuke... I can hardly wait for him.

172
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,596
He'll come here even by himself...

173
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,463
I would have been totally hammered.

174
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,572
That's not the case.

175
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,641
My sensei said it often...

176
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,204
Luck is also a part of strength.

177
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,840
That backseat driver?

178
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,017
He's not a backseat driver!

179
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:13,777
It's because...

180
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,023
I wasn't good enough at that time!

181
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,630
I'm grateful for you saving me.

182
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,632
But please don't talk like that
about my sensei!

183
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,700
You, too...?

184
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,434
When you feel that

185
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,207
the honor of someone you revere
has been hurt,

186
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,980
you yourself are hurt badly
and become enraged.

187
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,014
The more important the person
you revere is to you,

188
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,417
the greater the feeling...

189
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,819
<i>The clan won't die out...</i>
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

190
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,295
<i>I will remain inside</i>
<i>Lord Orochimaru's soul for all eternity.</i>

191
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:01,134
<i>That person,</i>
<i>Lord Orochimaru, understands me!</i>

192
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,270
<i>What do you guys know?!</i>

193
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:09,372
Fighting for the sake of someone
important to you...

194
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:16,516
He was also the same
as Naruto Uzumaki...

195
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,580
But... the person who is important
to oneself

196
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,147
might not always be "virtuous"

197
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,520
I wonder...

198
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:30,827
There's no way someone evil
can be thought of as an important person.

199
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:34,994
No. Even if you know they're evil...

200
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,365
People can't defeat solitude...

201
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,323
Sasuke!

202
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,952
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

203
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:30,047
<i>And you smiled</i>

204
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,589
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

205
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,390
<i>In my own words</i>

206
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:41,025
<i>Would you think it was</i>
<i>a bother if I approached you?</i>

207
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:46,569
<i>Despite my doubts,</i>
<i>I worked up my courage</i>

208
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,244
<i>My clumsy attempts with words</i>

209
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:57,975
<i>You listened without turning away</i>

210
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:04,153
<i>No wonder I get carried away by you</i>

211
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:11,225
<i>But you don't feel anything for me, do you?</i>

212
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,428
<i>I feel so sad</i>

213
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,399
<i>But...</i>

214
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,869
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

215
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:20,907
<i>And you smiled</i>

216
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,635
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

217
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,703
<i>In my own words</i>

218
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,212
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

219
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:32,411
<i>And you smiled</i>

220
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:34,954
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

221
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,923
<i>In my own words</i>

222
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:42,552
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

223
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,337
You gotta be kidding me!

224
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,633
What do you mean
"for achieving your goal"?!

225
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:59,074
Orochimaru wants you
only as a "vessel"!

226
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,907
There's no way
I can let you go to him!

227
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,440
This is no joke!

228
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:11,782
If you insist on going,
I have to take you back by force!

229
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,224
