00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:20,881
<i>Connecting old words</i>
<i>that have been used up</i>

2
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:29,623
<i>I just want to convey</i>
<i>my simple thoughts</i>

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,060
<i>That day's faint wind blows away</i>

4
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,190
<i>at the castle ruins of yesterday</i>

5
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:45,338
<i>I'll laugh with you</i>
<i>and live for the moment</i>

6
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:52,979
<i>Still that incident</i>
<i>will continue to trouble you, right?</i>

7
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:57,874
<i>That's why it must be good bye</i>

8
00:00:57,952 --> 00:01:04,858
<i>Leaving nothing behind,</i>
<i>let us share what is left</i>

9
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:12,057
<i>In time, we'll realize</i>
<i>that it was everything</i>

10
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>And sadness will touch our cheeks,</i>
<i>creating a river of tears</i>

11
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:28,775
<i>Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex</i>
<i>and melting away</i>

12
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:07,911
Sasuke!

13
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,184
Are you going to
run away from me?!

14
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:37,216
Yo... loser.

15
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:42,618
<i>A Cry on Deaf Ears</i>

16
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,061
It's you this time, huh?

17
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,944
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>
<i>I was not able to stop Sasuke...</i>

18
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:12,980
<i>I think...</i>
<i>the one who can stop Sasuke...</i>

19
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:15,517
<i>the one who can save Sasuke is...</i>

20
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,825
<i>Naruto...you are the only one.</i>

21
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:26,356
<i>Naruto...this is my...</i>
<i>once in a lifetime...favor to ask...</i>

22
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:31,704
<i>Please... Please bring Sasuke back!</i>

23
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,310
I also told this to Sakura, but...

24
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:42,542
Don't mind me anymore.

25
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,151
What's with that face?

26
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,167
<i>Iruka Sensei, why on the earth</i>
<i>does an outstanding person like me</i>

27
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,569
<i>have to be on the same team with him?</i>

28
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,538
<i>Sasuke graduated with</i>
<i>the highest grade out of all students...</i>

29
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:13,212
<i>Naruto, you are at the bottom!</i>

30
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,439
<i>When you even out</i>
<i>the team's strength,</i>

31
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,041
<i>then it naturally becomes like this.</i>

32
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:22,250
<i>Try your best not to slow me down,</i>
<i>you dunce.</i>

33
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:28,860
<i>I am fine without eating!</i>
<i>I am absolutely fine.</i>

34
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:32,091
<i>I'm...fine...</i>

35
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,057
<i>Here.</i>

36
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:49,881
<i>You asked Sakura for a hint the other day,</i>
<i>what did she tell you?</i>

37
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:54,845
<i>Shall we go?</i>

38
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,412
<i>Yup.</i>

39
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,929
<i>Wh What's with that face...?</i>

40
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,699
<i>You loser...</i>

41
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,872
<i>Why... ?

42
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:19,938
<i>You... I hated you, you know.</i>

43
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,284
<i>It's none of your business!</i>

44
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:37,324
<i>Who knows,</i>
<i>my body moved on its own.</i>

45
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:45,668
<i>You rescue Sakura, no matter what!</i>

46
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:49,068
<i>Sasuke... You...</i>

47
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,370
<i>I could still distract him for a little while...</i>

48
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,209
<i>I lost everything once.</i>

49
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:06,184
<i>I don't want to see my precious comrades</i>
<i>die in front of me anymore.</i>

50
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:10,764
Why...?

51
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,397
Why is it... Sasuke?

52
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:22,141
Why did you become like this?!

53
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,942
You!

54
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:36,548
Whatever happens to me,
what does that have to do with you?

55
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:40,292
I have my own way.

56
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,859
No matter who it is,

57
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,830
nobody has the right
to tell me what to do.

58
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,334
I will tell you the truth.

59
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:54,730
I'm done fooling around with
you guys of the Leaf.

60
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,171
Go home.

61
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,219
<i>I'll take care of him!</i>

62
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,595
Choji...

63
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,096
<i>Go everyone!</i>

64
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>Go, quickly! I'll catch up with you.</i>

65
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:25,930
Neji...

66
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,136
<i>Okay!</i>

67
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:30,969
<i>Hold on!</i>

68
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:38,416
Kiba...

69
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:41,081
<i>Kiba! Akamaru!</i>

70
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:44,783
<i>Now! Naruto!</i>

71
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:47,759
Shikamaru...

72
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:49,920
<i>The strategy...a success!</i>

73
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:53,399
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Please go quickly!</i>

74
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:58,928
<i>You also promised Sakura</i>
<i>with a Nice Guy pose, Naruto.</i>

75
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:00,574
Bushy Brow...

76
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,842
<i>I'll defeat this person.</i>

77
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:06,945
<i>It's a promise.</i>

78
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,609
Everyone...

79
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:18,122
Everyone risked their lives
to come after you, you know!

80
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,085
Good job for them.

81
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:39,407
<i>Lastly, I will tell you</i>
<i>the most important thing.</i>

82
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:46,375
<i>Sasuke is neither a close friend</i>
<i>of mine nor is he someone I like.</i>

83
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:50,849
<i>But Sasuke is a Shinobi of</i>
<i>the Village Hidden in the Leaves...</i>

84
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,520
<i>A comrade.</i>

85
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,793
<i>That's why we will rescue him</i>
<i>by risking our lives.</i>

86
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:57,287
<i>This is the Leaf way.</i>

87
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:21,421
How do you take
your comrades of the Leaf?!

88
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:53,184
Comrades, you said...

89
00:09:55,756 --> 00:10:00,159
Did I become stronger staying
with those so -called comrades?

90
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,495
I am going to where Orochimaru is.

91
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,269
Orochimaru is the person who killed
the Third Hokage

92
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,828
and tried to crush The Leaf Village!

93
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,836
Do you think he will
give you the power freely?

94
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,608
He just wants your body
as a vessel!

95
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,847
You might not be able to come back.
You might get killed.

96
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:31,180
You think I'd easily let you
go to such a place?!

97
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:49,332
That doesn't matter to me...

98
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:55,374
If my goal is accomplished,
then that's all that matters.

99
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,412
If you intend to get in that way...

100
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,052
Then it can't be helped...

101
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,360
You're not gonna be able to!
I'll take you back even by force!

102
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,466
Why are you laughing?!

103
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,098
You were laughing at that time too.

104
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:25,970
That time...?

105
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:27,912
<i>What's funny?</i>

106
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:31,279
<i>It's not funny. I am happy.</i>

107
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,852
<i>Thinking about...</i>
<i>how I can finally defeat you here.</i>

108
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:41,854
That time you wanted to fight me, right?

109
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,292
You were thrilled weren't you?

110
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:45,827
At first!

111
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,127
But, you were different.

112
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,064
That was...

113
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,067
<i>Hurry up and come.</i>

114
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:57,338
<i>But first, put on your Headband.</i>
<i>I'll wait.</i>

115
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,637
<i>I don't need such a thing...</i>

116
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,575
<i>Just put it on!</i>

117
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:08,745
<i>You won't be able to</i>
<i>put one scratch on my face.</i>

118
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,255
<i>That's not it!</i>

119
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:15,060
<i>I'm saying that this is a sign</i>
<i>that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.</i>

120
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,160
<i>That is what I call a stuck up!</i>

121
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:20,729
<i>You think you and I are equal?</i>

122
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,596
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

123
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:26,397
<i>I've never thought I was inferior to you.</i>

124
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,466
<i>You're so obnoxious!</i>

125
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,977
<i>Stop!</i>

126
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,047
That was...

127
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,521
That was not the kind of fight I wanted.

128
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,759
Even now... this is not...

129
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,835
I don't care about
your circumstances.

130
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:07,066
<i>What...is this power?</i>

131
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,408
<i>Power is flowing out...</i>

132
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,194
<i>So this is the power that</i>
<i>the guy was talking about.</i>

133
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>Furthermore, the power</i>
<i>is growing into my body.</i>

134
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:47,636
<i>If it is like that now...</i>
<i>if I release this curse mark...</i>

135
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,748
<i>I wonder how much power...</i>

136
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:06,963
<i>Wh What power...</i>

137
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,399
<i>He's not the same as before...</i>

138
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:13,185
Wake up already!

139
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,412
I awakened long ago...

140
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,689
From my idiotic self who dreams about
a lax peaceful future...

141
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:50,993
hanging out with comrades.

142
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,528
That's why I left the village!

143
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,235
That's why I sought power!

144
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,667
My dream is not in the future.

145
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,543
My dream is in the past...

146
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,184
That's the only place it exists.

147
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:04,536
Wow, Brother!

148
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:07,577
You hit the target right in the middle,
even the one behind the rock!

149
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,746
All right, me too!

150
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,449
Sasuke, let's go home.

151
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,653
Geez... You said that
you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

152
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,752
There is an important mission tomorrow
and I need to prepare for that.

153
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,688
Liar...

154
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:44,709
Forgive me, Sasuke...
Another time.

155
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,778
Brother, watch me!

156
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,153
Hey! If you push yourself...

157
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,601
Why is the one who twisted
his ankle laughing?

158
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,568
Could it be that you are trying
to take the easy way?

159
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,238
That's not true...

160
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,537
I'm happy thinking about

161
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,307
how I'm finally going to
the Academy starting tomorrow.

162
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:22,747
<i>I'm going to do my best</i>
<i>when I enter the Academy.</i>

163
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:28,051
<i>So even that father will approve of me.</i>

164
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,784
<i>He will count on me</i>
<i>like he does on my brother...</i>

165
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:51,600
Sasuke... You really are...

166
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,143
I told you...

167
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:02,083
I don't need a future
with you guys anymore.

168
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,121
<i>Fire Style. Dragon Flame Jutsu.</i>

169
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:27,175
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

170
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,270
<i>And you smiled</i>

171
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,812
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

172
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:35,613
<i>In my own words</i>

173
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:41,249
<i>Would you think it was</i>
<i>a bother if I approached you?</i>

174
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:46,791
<i>Despite my doubts,</i>
<i>I worked up my courage</i>

175
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:52,468
<i>My clumsy attempts with words</i>

176
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,198
<i>You listened without turning away</i>

177
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:04,375
<i>No wonder I get carried away by you</i>

178
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:11,448
<i>But you don't feel anything for me, do you?</i>

179
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,651
<i>I feel so sad</i>

180
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:15,623
<i>But...</i>

181
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,092
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

182
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,130
<i>And you smiled</i>

183
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:23,858
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

184
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,926
<i>In my own words</i>

185
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,436
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

186
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:32,634
<i>And you smiled</i>

187
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:35,177
<i>For the first time, I was able to speak</i>

188
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:38,146
<i>In my own words</i>

189
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:42,777
<i>For the first time, I spoke to you</i>

190
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,924
I feel power surging
through my body...

191
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,965
It's as though I can't lose.

192
00:22:56,733 --> 00:23:01,568
It's power I'd never have gained
playing comrade with you guys from Leaf.

193
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:06,769
But it's not enough.
It's way short of enough, Naruto!

194
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:11,506
Strength... hatred... and desire!

195
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:15,474
