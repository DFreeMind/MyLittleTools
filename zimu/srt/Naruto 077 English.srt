2
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,060
Shit!

3
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,580
Damn it... At this rate this will be really bad.

4
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,160
No matter what...

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,510
No matter what I'll save all of them!

6
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,270
Light and Darkness
The Name Gaara

7
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,550
You fight for others?

8
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,500
That's why you guys stay that level.

9
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,950
You don't need a reason for fighting.

10
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,570
Only a winner can experience the value of existence.

11
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,710
Forget about your worthless friends and
just fight only for your own existence.

12
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,480
Worthless...

13
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,840
friends...

14
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,000
Those who bring in worthless emotions should die.

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You... I won't let you keep talking like that...

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm going to defeat you no matter what!

17
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,830
You guys don't know what real strength is...

18
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,150
Shut up!

19
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,350
Why? Tell me why?

20
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,530
Why are you... Why?

21
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,250
Why?

22
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:26,150
Love is a pure heart because you want to
help those precious people close to you.

23
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,840
Just like my big sister.

24
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,270
You are a precious person who's close to me.

25
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,880
You always... always... me... why?

26
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,470
It was an order.

27
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,550
I was asked to kill you...

28
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,420
by your father, Kazekage-sama.

29
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,410
By my father...?

30
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
Why does my father want me...?

31
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:29,360
You were born with the Shukaku of Sand as an experiment.

32
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,460
But you are unable to take control of the sand
that contains the living spirit of Shukaku and...

33
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,710
will be too dangerous for the village itself in future.

34
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,730
Before that becomes a reality...

35
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,560
Then, you had no choice because of my father's order...

36
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,710
No, that's not true.

37
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,740
It's true that I was ordered by Kazekage-sama...

38
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,710
But if I wanted to I could've refused that order.

39
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:20,370
Gaara-sama, in the deepest bottom of my heart, I've probably been...

40
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,500
...cursing you.

41
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,120
You were born by taking the life from my sister that I loved.

42
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,870
I've tried so hard trying to love you as a keepsake of my sister.

43
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,510
But I couldn't.

44
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,770
She didn't want to give birth to you.

45
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,370
She became a victim for this village and died cursing this village.

46
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,970
From then, I believe I got a wound of the heart that never healed.

47
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,550
Unlike the wound of the body, it doesn't have medical
cream to help it heal. Also, it may never heal.

48
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,270
A wound of the heart?

49
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,250
Your name is what my sister gave you.

50
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,840
This boy's name is Gaara.

51
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,760
Shura loves himself... 
(Gaara = The god of war who loves himself)

52
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,210
So love only yourself...

53
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,120
And fight only for yourself.

54
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,160
You will continue existing if you do so.

55
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,290
Those were her wishes.

56
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,030
But she didn't name you this because she was worried or loved you.

57
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,110
The reason why she wished you to keep
existing and named you this name is...

58
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:59,430
...to let her deep grudge to this
village exist and always remain.

59
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,960
To make it known to the world that...

60
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,000
...you were not loved.

61
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,550
"Explosion note"

62
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,320
This is the end.  Please die.

63
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,750
I think my sister loved you.

64
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,790
Love?

65
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,110
The sand protecting you automatically is the love of your mother.

66
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,250
I think mother's will is in that sand.

67
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,990
It's Love.

68
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,760
Love only yourself.

69
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,850
And fight only for yourself.

70
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,550
That's what Gaara means... me.

71
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,300
I finally understand.

72
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,330
I'm alone.

73
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,290
I'll never believe anybody anymore

74
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,500
I will love no one.

75
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,970
I'm alone.

76
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,690
That's right. I'm all alone.

77
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,520
What's wrong? Come already!

78
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,460
You don't mind having your "precious friends" suffering?

79
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,770
Shit!

80
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,400
This is not like the usual Naruto. Did
something happened between those two?

81
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,340
Somehow... somehow I have to rescue Sakura-chan.

82
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,350
But how?

83
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,990
Yep, that's right. In this case,
though I'll use up lots of chakra...

84
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,470
I've got to summon Gamaoyabin!

85
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,650
Kuchiyose no Jutsu!

86
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,140
What? It's just a kid.

87
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,630
If you've got some business with
me then give me some snacks...

88
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,170
...or else I won't play with you.

89
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,220
I've got to say that I hate you so-called frogs!

90
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,480
What? Don't underestimate us Amphibians!

91
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,950
It's not time to play around you little one.

92
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,770
Damn it. Why? I trained so hard.

93
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,180
I don't have any other way...

94
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,000
I have to save everybody!

95
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,440
"everybody", you say? Don't make me laugh.

96
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,720
I fight only for myself.

97
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,630
He's transforming again.

98
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,840
If you don't defeat me the sand
on this girl won't get released.

99
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,350
On top of that, the sand will get tighter as
time passes and it eventually will kill this girl.

100
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,330
He's getting close to the final form.

101
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,620
He hasn't started that jutsu yet,
but at this rate even I will be...

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,070
Those eyes...

103
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,570
Sand Shuriken!

104
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,850
You are weak.

105
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,550
Shut up!

106
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,370
Any way’s, what is that?

107
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,050
You're so stubborn, Sarutobi Sensei.

108
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,850
It doesn't move.

109
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,750
You two should be dead already.

110
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,520
You still don't understand it, Orochimaru?

111
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,870
The Konoha village is my house.

112
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,890
And I told you that I'm the pillar of this house.

113
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,500
That's why I told you that I'll break that pillar!

114
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:51,920
As long as the people in Konoha fight for their precious
friends, this pillar won't get broken by somebody like you!

115
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,240
Is that so?

116
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,750
Don't underestimate Hokage.

117
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,770
No way. Where have you... your chakra should be drained by now.

118
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,140
Chakra and Ninjutsu are not everything of power.

119
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,390
What sad eyes...

120
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,930
Eyes that shows the deep solitude.

121
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,750
This guy is a monster.

122
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,830
The same as me.

123
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,750
I hated everybody.

124
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,740
I didn't know who I was, why I was hated so much, or why I existed.

125
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:55,170
In other words, you are the nine tailed demon fox
that killed Iruka's parents and destroyed this village.

126
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,480
You have been fooled by everybody in this village all along.

127
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,530
After I learned that there's the Kyubi inside me,
people in this village seemed colder to me than before.

128
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,920
Really, it was very painful.

129
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,670
But...

130
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,870
Naruto, do you want to go to eat Ramen?

131
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,350
Yes! I'll get extra Chasu today!

132
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,250
You useless idiot. If you want to
win against me then train harder.

133
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,370
Shut up. I won't lose to you!

134
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
Hey Naruto. What did Sasuke-kun say about me?

135
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,090
Nothing much.

136
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,550
Hey, don't you want to know what I think of...?

137
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,190
Naruto, you're gonna die for sure if
you keep eating only Ramen and Shiruko.

138
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,230
As a Ninja you need to eat more vegetables.

139
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,760
I brought these for you.

140
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,540
I don't like vegetables.

141
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,680
I had people who recognized me.

142
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,840
That's why I wasn't concerned about the demon fox
inside me or people in the village treating me coldly.

143
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm not alone anymore.

144
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,830
I never imagined that it would
bring me this much joy and happiness.

145
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,240
I really... really thought it's great.

146
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:35,070
I felt that it's ok for me to be here and I'm existing and... I felt at ease.

147
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,720
That's why I feel so desperate when I think of the past.

148
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,250
That pain is no joke.

149
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,320
It's a dark hell.

150
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,570
If I were still alone...

151
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,180
That's why I understood.

152
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,010
Then, for what do I exist and live...

153
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,760
I concluded like this...

154
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,740
I exist to kill every existence but me.

155
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,110
I don't know what happened to him.

156
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,580
But he's been all alone and has kept suffering...

157
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:20,450
Never feeling at ease, and even now he can trust only  himself.

158
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,680
He's struggling in hell even now.

159
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,680
That's right. To him, I'm somebody that is...

160
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,480
...a weakling living in no-worries world.

161
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,330
Is it really possible to win against such a guy?

162
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,200
What's wrong? Are you afraid of me?

163
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,840
Fight for the others or fight only for yourself...

164
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,080
Just love yourself and do it.

165
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,710
Fight only for yourself!

166
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,430
That's the definition of the strongest person.

167
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,510
Fight with me. Where's your
spirit you had a few moments ago?

168
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,340
Show me your power. I'll crush that power.

169
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,720
What's up? If you don't fight with me I'll kill this girl.

170
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,790
Shit!

171
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,930
Taju Kagebunshin no Jutsu
(extra-multiple Kagebunshin)

172
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,940
Fuuton Mugen Sajin Daitoppa
(Wind element Limitless Sand Dust Great Wind Wave)

173
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,720
That's not good. That was a bad hit.

174
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm going to play around without killing you for now.

175
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,490
I'm looking forward to see when you

Not yet.

178
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,080
What is this feeling?

179
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,450
Sand Shuriken!

180
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,900
