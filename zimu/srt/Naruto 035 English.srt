It still makes it.

Ce others to conserve want some.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Three are little.

21
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,340
Others three times, cretino.

22
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,000
But you know how much to it is laborious?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,100
You come!

24
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,550
Sasuke-kun!

25
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,000
I have prepared the firewood for the fire!

26
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,480
Can ignite it you to me?

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,820
Then three fish will go well.

28
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,550
It waits for a moment!

29
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,670
Prohibited Sbirciare!
The secret parchment.

30
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,680
They are already four days
that the second test is begun.

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,260
You have reason.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,670
E' begun to the three of the afternoon.

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,191
Us hours remain 25-26

34
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,603
Many groups will have already ended.
If it were cos 

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,672
I cannot wait for that it cooks.

36
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,960
It does not go at all well.

37
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,100
Most large it is mine to the large one

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,250
Probably they are not remained
many adversaries to chase.

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,990
What we make?

40
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,660
Many will have finished the test.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,980
Already, we are to the fourth day.

42
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,580
However it is

43
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,100
 noon is past, eats.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,440
You rest yourselves.

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
I go to try something.

46
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,360
Hey!

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,590
Mmh?

48
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:18,000
The other coil had written "Sky ",
and it had the edges white men, true?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,570
I have not made case us when
it has shown them before the examination.

50
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,703
Why what you are thinking?

51
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,960
N you will not want at all

52
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
Even

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,810
 ce they are not any more than coils of the Sky.

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,500
What you would want to say, Sakura?

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Four of the five days
of According to Examination they are already passes to you.

56
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,249
This means that we have
used 80% of the time available.

57
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,000
There are 78 participants, uniforms in 26 squares

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 with 13 coils of Sky and 13 of the Earth
and only 13 squares can be promoted.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,930
Moreover memories, Sasuke-kun?

60
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,220
Orochimaru has burnt
our coil of the Sky.

61
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,870
This means

62
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,217
 that only 12 squares can be promoted.

63
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,013
Moreover, I do not have guarantees that
the other coils are intact.

64
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,600
There are separates to you from
other boys of Konoha

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,320
 and we have used two days in order to recover to us.
We must begin to increase the step.

66
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,830
The next enemy

67
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,556
 it will be our last possibility!

68
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,500
I go to take other water.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,220
You feel listens

70
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,490
We can have the coil
also without to fight.

71
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,450
Eh?

72
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,668
You will not want at all

73
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,909
And instead!

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,850
I have many coils with me.

75
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,850
One for the Ninja techniques,
one of the poisons and the other for the notes.

76
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,264
If of ritocchiamo one
identical to the coil of the sky

77
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:45,200
It waits for! As you can make it if not
you know what is written within?

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,161
If the esaminatrice watches
to the inner one it discovers us of sure! Dumb!

79
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,100
There will be sure some word of order

80
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,643
 incomprensibile without the other coil.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,642
Therefore the word of order for being promoted serves us.
I bet to us!

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,990
We do not know which it is the content

83
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,584
 therefore not there is way to make of a false one!

84
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,000
Dumb! inasmuch as you were much sure one of you
I thought you said something of intelligent.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,350
But

86
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,400
 we could assume of the content.

87
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:29,250
Through the coil of the Earth.

88
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,220
You would want therefore

89
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,450
We will try to open the coil.

90
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,830
Not!!

91
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,810
Six forgotten the rule, idiot to you!

92
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,210
We cannot watch the content
of the coil before arriving to the tower.

93
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,250
But we are in the troubles, not?

94
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,143
There is even some type of trap.
You are careful!

95
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,899
 I know it!

96
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,100
Hey! Cos' has happened? Hey!

97
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,263
Which thing has happened?

98
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,580
Hey!
You say something!

99
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,000
Better than not.

100
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,610
An enemy!?

101
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,100
Dumb! You do not have hope.

102
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,570
Fortune that I was near.

103
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,488
Me dispiace

104
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,230
Those that smash the rule
they are obligates to you to withdraw itself.

105
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:16,766
In the previous examination, who opened the coil
he came ipnotizzato from one magical formula.

106
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:22,349
Cos   slept until expiring of the time.

107
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,192
Calls you Kabuto, true?

108
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:30,189
What here you are making alone?

109
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,820
Calm, I do not want your coil.

110
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,000
Probable

111
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,886
 inasmuch as you could have stolen it to Naruto.

112
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,530
Then also you are
trying the coil of the Sky?

113
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,807
I do not have Them entrambi.Guarda.

114
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,730
What?

115
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,230
Of it I have passages of all the colors

116
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,230
 but hour I was heading towards
the tower in order to meet my companions.

117
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,880
Therefore you excuse to me.

118
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,530
It waits for!!

119
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,670
I defy to you to duel.

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,870
That fortune!!

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,540
You would want to defy to me?

122
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,810
Sasuke-kun

123
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,470
That you are saying, idiot!!

124
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,670
He speaks seriously?

125
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,680
Me dispiace, but us it does not remain much time!

126
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey Sasuke!
Kabuto-saint it has to us as soon as helped!!

127
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,790
Sasuke-kun, anch' I am of I come to an agreement with

128
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,300
Tacete!!

129
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,620
Sasuke-kun

130
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,340
We do not have alternative.
Ve I have already said it before

131
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,565
 it is the only way that we have
in order to survive in this forest!

132
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,309
Bugiardo!

133
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,430
Bugiardo?

134
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,492
Not six much coherent one
as you want to make to believe.

135
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,100
If you thought it truly cos 
why you would have to defy to me?

136
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,954
You would not have to announce this challenge

137
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:14,427
But to attack me to the unexpected one, in order to take me of surprise!

138
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,159
Cos   acts a ninja.

139
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,575
Com' is deep.

140
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,056
Not me dispiace this side of your character.

141
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,761
For this I will say  what  to make to you.

142
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,716
But we speak road making.

143
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:40,000
The smoke of the fire and the odore of the fish
they were felt from enough far away.

144
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,095
The enemies and the wild beasts will notice us.

145
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,550
Six sure one that there are still opposing?
-, of they are sure. -

146
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,820
You must only think a po' in order to understand it to us.

147
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,100
Sai qual' is the better way in order to fight in means
to giungla or in one the forest like this?

148
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,890
Not

149
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,814
The objective of all the candidates
it is the tower to the center of the forest.

150
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:23,303
Therefore when the place arrives the last day
easier in order to collect the coils it is

151
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,480
 around to the tower.

152
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,000
I have understood!

153
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,680
We must stretch an ambush to the squares
that they possess already the two coils.

154
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,310
Just E' for 1/3.

155
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,100
Eh?

156
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Why you are not the only ones
to think it in this way.

157
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,380
Probable E' that already has been posizionate
traps close to the tower.

158
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,643
It wants to say that they will be in many to wait for to us!

159
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,870
E' as well as dangerous exciting how much.

160
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,270
I do not see the hour!

161
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,380
It will be enough to defeat them and we will take
the coil of the sky exceeding the test!

162
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,730
Cos   is right for 2/3

163
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,000
Which it would be the third lacking element?

164
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,220
Draft of the collectors always
present in this examination.

165
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,640
Collectors?

166
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,100
Also with the near tower,
this remains a difficult examination.

167
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,240
This situation creates the collectors.

168
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,230
That is those who tries to collect
of the coils in more

169
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,702
 to offer to eventual
adversaries of advanced force.

170
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:42,630
Or passing it to the companions of the same country
to the aim to obtain favors in the successive tests.

171
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,550
Or there are those that think
to take advantage of an ambush

172
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,750
 simply in order to eliminate of the candidates.

173
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,350
As you will have understood
the collectors are many forts.

174
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,320
They are gets worse enemies who you can meet
poich never they are not satisfied.

175
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,610
Hour I understand.
E' for that you come with we!?

176
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,900
You have fear of they, true?

177
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,100

It seems that someone

205
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,310
 warm acceptance has prepared us one.

206
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,100

around to the same place.

They are observing.

216
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Sure they are trying
to tire to us most possible

217
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,350
 in order to attack us when we are to the extreme.

218
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,280
Therefore we are making the game of the enemy.

219
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,000
They will attack to us soon.

220
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,750
