21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,180

Episode #104
A storm is get loosed on the island of Nagi

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,660
You run Idate, you run!

24
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,210
Aoi, Bastard!

25
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,590
Not scappi?

26
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,020
Scappare is your specialty, not?

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,930
You are zitto!

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,520
They are not like you!

29
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,230
You mistakes. I and you are equal.

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,210
He does not trust you the aliens. You betray them.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
You have betrayed your brother. and abandoned your village.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,010
Six one orribile and egoist person.

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,500
You while still alive do not have reason to be.

34
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,570
You die!

35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,150
Sakura-chan, as it goes?

36
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,500
It is  a scratch, nothing of serious.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,820
Instead…

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Those ninja of the Rain…

39
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,670
they are not worth nothing.

40
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,480
It is not this. If they were following Idate-saint…

41
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,230
Idate is in danger!?

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,550
It is  about that we are speaking!

43
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,550
Naruto, is not the moment to make the buffone.

44
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,620
Not!

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,690
Quà Sono!

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,080
Naruto!

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,780
That fortune.

48
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,960
In the water, we are invincible.

49
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,410
They are one annoyance.>.

50
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,920
Finally they have fallen in trap.

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,530
Misu bunshin not jutsu

52
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Sakura-chan!

53
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,970
Kage bunshin not jutsu

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,820
Che imbecille.

55
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,590
To that they serve of the Kage bunshin in this situation ?

56
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,210
In these deep waters, you do not have no hope against ours cloni of water.

57
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,430
Even if tests to make something,

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,070
I know who I am that true one

59
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,280
Which thing is making?

60
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,260
Impossible!

61
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,920
Good idea! The chakra it provokes upsets some!

62
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,880
Bravo Naruto!

63
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,780
It is  first part of the Rasengan training!

64
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,330
Sakura-chan!

65
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,100
Sakura-chan, you hold hard!

66
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,010
Sakura-chan, you hold hard!

67
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,970
Not to abandon to us, Sakura-chan!

68
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,280
Sakura-chan?

69
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,620
You resist! Sakura-chan!

70
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,120
This is…

71
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,620
The last hope.>.

72
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,660
Sasuke-kun?

73
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,990
It would appeal to to me that Sasuke-kun revived to me…

74
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,920
With a mouth mouth…

75
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
....  Sakura-chan.

76
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Which thing you wanted to make? Idiot!

77
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,790
Sasuke-kun?

78
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,050
We do not have time in order to rest to us. We must find Idate and escort it.>.

79
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,680
It waits for, Sasuke-kun.

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,830
You do not leave me here.>.

81
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,940
In this moment,

82
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,870
Fukusuke is in order to catch up the stage of the Tempio di Modoroki.

83
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,120
You do not have more no possibility than to catch up it.

84
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,840
You will not be more able than to run, and not to raise to you.

85
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,310
When the pain propagherà in your body,

86
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,380
You will have caught up an other stage.>.

87
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,640
that Hell is called!

88
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,950
Which thing tasks to make with your stupid knife?

89
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,750
Not to touch it!

90
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,950
It seems that you do not know more from where you come.

91
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,770
You cannot only run…

92
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,920
with this fierezza.. he is unforgivable.

93
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,550
I…

94
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,440
You pardon to me…

95
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,480
Head…

96
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,880
I will not be able  to honor my promise.

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Idate!

98
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,980
You…

99
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,190
That rain!

100
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,460
Then the six leader of the Rain?

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,680
If you have them defeats, is only because you were more than they.>.

102
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,090
You are only of the Genin, your level is not that one of Konoha.

103
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,080
He is  orribile.

104
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,360
You are only of the Genin, like you will make to stop to me?

105
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,120
You close the spout!

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,080
Over!

107
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,260
It is  all what sapete to make here?

108
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,720
You would have to follow the same road of Idate.

109
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
E' the moment to send you to the other world.

110
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,390
Useless to waste other chakra.

111
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Sakura-chan!

112
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,520
These needles…

113
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,720
It is  my poisoned rain.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,760
Any is the resistance of your body, after some minuteren will be fatal.

115
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,950
Not to underrate us…

116
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,630
Fukusuke has caught up the Tempio di Modoroki.

117
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,070
It would be piaciuto to see to me to you to die. For of the Genin like you, to die cos ì  it is an honor.>.

118
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,990
The Wagarashi clan will still win?

119
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,610
Could not happen a miracle?

120
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,940
By now it is only a memory when Jirochou controlled the city.

121
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,990
They are truly tired.

122
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,990
You are best, the Fukusuke-saint one.

123
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,790
If continued cos ì,  the head of the Wagarashi will be content!

124
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,420
Not to speak cos ì  in front of me. For who you take to me?

125
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,620
Which thing?

126
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,180
It has been already decided that  I will win. You leave to make one pause me.

127
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,050
Cursed, not to remove to you.

128
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,610
Hour enough!

129
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,680
Brother, does not have accadergli null!

130
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,350
Sai what would make the Head us?

131
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,110
I know.

132
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,850
Not to forget it.

133
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,380
Merda! This boy…

134
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,380
Naruto, Sasuke-kun.

135
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,730
This is…

136
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,050
Sakura-chan, this is…

137
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,280
When I have left Konoha,

138
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Tsunade-sama has given this to me.

139
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,680
You take these. They are sure that of it you will have need.

140
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,680
The Old One?

141
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,600
With this, it will resume acquaintance soon.

142
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,790
Sasuke-kun and Naruto, prendetene one.

143
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,170
If the lasciamo here, its body will be exposed to the cold.

144
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,500
We must put it from an other part.

145
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,960
Brother!

146
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,510
It watches! They have finally become a Ninja!

147
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,610
I understand.

148
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,920
They have been the best one.

149
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,940
Beginning from now,

150
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,610
I will always train myself , and I  will make  of the missions, and  will become  to all Chuunin speed!

151
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,420
After  I will be  Jonin!  I will become  like you, brother!

152
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,860
And all will call me "Idate-sama!"

153
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,350
Brother?

154
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,980
It listens well, Idate.

155
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,390
There are of the more important things that the force and the infuence.

156
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,450
More important?

157
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
Until you will not have comprised it,

158
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,910
You will not be able to realize your dreams.

159
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,030
It is being resumed!

160
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,070
You are well?

161
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,740
Dov' is? Aoi?

162
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,270
It is  disappeared. Aoi? E' cos ì  that this ninja of the Rain is called?

163
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,750
Idate-saint, you know it?

164
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,130
It was my sensei when I lived to Konoha.

165
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,160
Tu.... to Konoha?

166
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,730
Aoi has betrayed Konoha and has become a Jonin of the Village of the Rain.

167
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,210
Che cos' has happened?

168
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,480
You would not have to move. You must still rest a po '.

169
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,020
Your hands are well?

170
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,070
Your hand.... you have held it the entire time!.

171
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,270
To be arrives end here to you…

172
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,780
it is not served to nothing!

173
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,100
You are losing heart yourself too much soon.

174
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,070
Six state truly a Ninja di Konoha?

175
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,820
I have forgotten all about Konoha, from when I have abandoned the village.

176
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,070
Abandoned?

177
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,610
I have failed to the Chuunin examination.

178
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,220
And I had taken it badly.

179
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,590
There were nearly, Idate.

180
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,830
Not to be sad.

181
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,220
Other ways exist in order to become Chuunin, without to pass from the examination.

182
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,000
Truly.

183
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,640
S ì,  truly.

184
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,500

Idate.

188
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,080
Aoi-sensei!

189
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,550
I have carried, as you have said to me.

190
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,500
They are the used Parchment and the Katana from According to Hokage.

191
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,110
The sword of Raijin.
[ Raijin is the God of the light ]

192
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,110
Beautiful job, Idate.

193
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,510
And with this,  I will become  Chuunin?

194
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,720
S ì,  you will become it.

195
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,110
To the Village of the Rain.

196
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,430
You and I will disappear from Konoha…

197
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,620
And we will carry with we our acquaintances.

198
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,110
Impossible…

199
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,430
They know that you have stolen the treasure of the Village.
You will not be able more living calm.

200
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,870
You have embedded to me!?

201
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,920
In order to survive in this world, us  it cannot  be trusted the others.

202
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,590
Not to forget it.

203
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,040
Now, than what you will make, Idate?

204
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,910
Any thing you had to choose, you would be announced publicly from Konoha.

205
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,350
Your reputation will be muddy, in order always.

206
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,670
Your reputation will be muddy, in order always.

207
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,790
After, they are returned to the village.

208
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,890
But I more did not succeed to do good the things

209
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,880
But Jirochou Head believes in me.

210
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,440
Even if I have not made nothing for he,

211
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,220
The Head has always had confidence in me!

212
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,890
But… io.>.

213
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,810
This boy…

214
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,810
He is  similar to me.

215
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,820
Nobody will recognize someone like you!

216
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
You die Naruto!

217
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,690
Naruto! It lowers to you!

218
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,840
They are truly.... a bond to null!

219
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,000
Because…

220
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,200
Because we are similar.

221
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,040
We have lived the same situation.

222
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,480
I only make of the stupidaggini, and I am incapable to end any thing.

223
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,990
Siccome has said Aoi to it, I…

224
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,380
I do not have the right of living!

225
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,690
Idiot!

226
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,990
There is at least a person whom he believes in you!

227
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,220
Is not true, Naruto?

228
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,480
You truly only feel yourself, is not true?

229
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,980
You must have suffered a lot, is not true?

230
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,750
One person!, better than nothing not?

231
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,690
The race still is not ended.

232
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,830
We must arrive until the end!

233
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,540
But…

234
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,930
It raises to you!

235
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,700
Naruto,  cannot. Its body is always…

236
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,570
If it  cannot  run, I  will carry  it on the race shoulders!

237
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,420
Probably our adversary has already caught up the Tempio di Modoroki.

238
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,360
Not to let go!

239
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,990
Naruto!

240
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,600
Sasuke-kun…

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,830
It leaves to make it.

242
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,230
Jirochou Head waits for, not?

243
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,100

244
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,510

254
